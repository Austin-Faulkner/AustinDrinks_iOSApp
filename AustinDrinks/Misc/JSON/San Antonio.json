If you see my photos, you will notice a lipstick stain or an unknown stain which was quite alarming, on the rim of the glass.. Not sure if it was put there to add some color to the glass or if my glass was not entirely washed throughly. With Covid still around this was absolutely absurd."

                "description": "I happened upon this gem by chance. I headed downtown with another destination in mind but while parking my car I heard a jazz band playing. At that moment I decided to give Devils River Distillery a try. There is outdoor seating but I decided to sit inside, in a spot where I could still hear the music but where it wasn't loud too loud to have a conversation. You had to go to the bar to order drinks. They had a menu of mixed drinks using Devils River of course. There is also the option to do whiskey flights or tastings. I decided on the Rasmanian Devil. A drink with whiskey, raspberry and lemon. This drink was very refreshing. Next time I'll be game to do a tasting. The ambiance was cool and I met a cool couple while chillin. I'll definitely be back and bring some friends."

                "description": "While visiting San Antonio , Riverwalk, we came across Devils River . WOW what a fun find. That night they had Nathan Bibano a electric violin player who was fantastic. He played so many fun tunes people were stopping and listening as they walked by.   As we walked into Devils River we were greeted by Adrian. He talked to us at length about the Distillery and its process. It was different from the ones we had seen and visited at the Kentucky Bourbon Festival. So it intrigued us.   We decided to try the tastings and started off with The Devils Alley which was Devils River Bourbon, Devils River Rye, and Devils River Coffee Bourbon which my wife really enjoyed too. Next we tried the Devils Boulevard which included Devils River Barrel Strength, Devils River Single Barrel, Devils River Distillers Select.  My wife also had a mixed bourbon coffee drink and loved it along with tasting some of my smooth milder Devils Bourbons.   All had its own flavors, from mild to okay that got our attention and YES we have some favorites.. but will leave that to you as everyone has different likes and dislikes for various reasons.. and YES we have well over 2 dozen Bourbons and Scotches in our home bar.    Kudos to JON, Adrian and Muldin for a great night and properly humidified cigar!  Also one of the owners and his wife stopped in to check on what was happening.. great to meet them too!  You now have a fan of your Devils Bourbon as told to you that night.. I already passed it on to our bourbon group.. in Florida and Georgia!     Please do not sell out to the big guys or China Corps as others have and ruin a good thing!"

He made sure we got a tour of the facility and explained each whiskey and drinks of our choice. Overall, Adrian made us feel welcome and gave us a great whiskey experience. Make sure to check it out if you are visiting San Antonio or are a local! Beautiful building, great ambiance, awesome drinks."

Whiskey itself is still second to Ranger Creek, but Devils River is still great and has an awesome location, with a cool inside, great patio and advertised rooftop patio that I didn't check out.  They off mixed drinks and had a frozen slushy coffee whiskey as well.  I did a flight of the high proof and it was fantastic!  We sat outside and it is on Houston St but has more privacy than some spots and is totally out of the sun.  This isn't a sports bar type place or dance club but has a comfortable laid back vibe.  I definitely plan to return."

We are very glad we chose to eat here - we split the Tomahawk and was very pleased with the cut and preparation of the meat.  It could have used a bit more seasoning for my taste, but overall it was excellent.  The Old Fashions were some of the best tasting I ever had.  Top notch dinner!!"

We sat at the bar and enjoyed a smoked bourbon old fashioned and a bourbon straight. We also had some fries, wings, and the charcuterie plate. I'd probably skip on the charcuterie plate next time unless you really need some quick bar snack bites. The wings were amazing though."

I had passed Maverick Whiskey multiple times when they were only selling hand sanitizer. The place looked cool.   I was downtown for The Monkees show. I wanted to stop by for a drink. The bartenders were very friendly and talented. They had a few unique drink options. The got one of both old fashioned cocktails they had on their drink menu. They were both great. The guys to the right of me were raving about the food especially the fries.   I had to order the fries and they were $11. They had a nice cheese sauce,bacon and a runny egg on top. The fries were super tasty. I will recommend them to everyone. I am looking forward to trying more menu items in the future. I will definitely be back."

The kitchen didn't open till 530 so we were stuck with some appetizers, menu it's not real expansive so basic meat which is fine. Dining space is a little tight and can get loud depending on the crowd but overall a cool spot"

                "description": "We celebrated a birthday here with dinner and drinks. We reserved a table and were seated immediately when we arrived. The dining area is upstairs. It's small, but the tables are spaced nicely. It wasn't too busy when we went.   We had tastings for their spirits and beer. Both excellent. $10 spirit flights are the way to go. We did try cocktails. Their old fashioned was on point. I love their little extras like the ice cube with their symbol.    Food was good too. We shared a pretzel, fried goat cheese, deviled eggs and cauliflower. For my main meal I had the smoked salmon nachos. They were delicious. The majority of the table got the bone in rib eye and were all happy with it.   Staff was friendly.   They don't have parking, but you can find nearby parking garages."

                "description": "Awesome atmosphere, cool story. Local whiskey distillery and restaurant near the Riverwalk. All whiskey is distilled in the old bank building with restaurant upstairs. The food was quite good - I got the mesquite pork Ribs. They were not traditional ribs, but they were smoked well and were tender. I thought the fries were excellent. The whiskey flight was a cheap and fun experience. Only $10 for a 4 drink flight. Probably equaled about 2 drinks.   I'll go back to try it again and maybe get an actual tour.   The women at the front door were fun and had a great attitude. Service was a little slow, but I had good company so it wasn't as big a deal."

                "description": "We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. We did the tour which lasted about an hour and a half and had dinner at the restaurant as well. The service was exceptional and everyone were very friendly and welcoming.  Our tour guide, Nicole, was fun, engaging and knowledgeable. The uniqueness of Maverick lies within its rich history and dyanmic cultural narratives surrounding the family and the area, so the tour is a must if you want to fully appreciate the experience! At the end of the tour, we tasted a few of their spirits and their straight bourbon whiskey. This whiskey has a lighter note to it and very smooth. My friend prefered the Alamo whiskey which has a bolder taste.   We also got a chance to hear some spooky ghost stories from Dan, the manager. \"Spirits and spirits\" ;)   The restaurant is upstairs with an elegant atmosphere and a view of the distillery on the side. The deviled eggs were okay but did not leave a strong impression. But their baby back ribs totally made up for it. The tender, juicy BBQ ribs combined with cripsy fries offered an amazingly satisfying taste. Their shrimp scampi is just as delicious, flavorful and cooked just right. The whiskey ice cream sweetly concluded our delightful evening there. We'll definitely recommend Maverick to everyone!"

We tried all their in house hooch on the tour and it was all great the whiskey is very flavorful with just a little burn.  The white rum was smooth as hell.  This isn't an especially cheap place for drinks and they are made to order so not super fast but it was a special occasion and I wasn't looking for frosty marg at chili's.   The tour was super fun.  They tell you from the get go it is more about the history of Sam Maverick than the process of making whiskey and I love Texas history so it was a lot of fun.    Pay attention because the more you remember the bigger the tasting samples!"

The waitress pretended they were out of the sirloin to try and upswell us on the $125 bone-in steak when we saw the table after us order several.  Also what genius decided to put a table right in between doors of the male and female bathrooms and seat costumers there when there are plenty of other open tables. The butter they eventually served us was delicious, it came with a side of poor quality steak."

We sat at the bar - which only had two chairs due to social distancing protocol - and it felt so nice to feel normal for a few hours!   The flights were great and I think a great price at $10 each. The tequila is so interesting and doesn't really taste like tequila - I really recommend it. We also had two cocktails, he had the old fashioned and I had the maverick margarita. Hands down one of the best, if not the best, margaritas I've ever had. No cloying sweetness, super fresh tasting.   Onto the food: it was all fantastic. The cauliflower was perfectly cooked and the Mac and cheese really hit the spot. My partner had the burger and he really enjoyed it. I snuck some of his fries and they were incredible.   Definitely give this place a shot, the bartender was very personable and the food is so delicious. I was also pleasantly surprised at the prices. I was a little sad that they didn't seem crowded on a Friday, though it may be because of covid and restrictions on number of people."

With this exquisite spirit, they create amazing and very refreshing cocktails perfect for our crazy Texas weather. If you are more of a beer drinker, they also brew HighWheel beer. My two favorite are HighWheel SA Hefe and HighWheel Betty.  During COVID-19, they have remained closed to the public but they offer curbside pick-up on all of their products; Rakia and beer. If you don't know how to prepare cocktails with Rakia, don't you worry! They have the recipes for all of their cocktails online. They also have a few cocktail making videos on their social channels, which are super helpful.   If you love beer and brandy, make sure to support local and check out this amazing distillery/brewery!"

Dealing with COVID hasn't been easy, but they've been creative and been able to keep their staff.  I prefer to make a stop here instead of buying at HEB.  Nothing wrong with HEB, but it's nice to also buy some Rakia or something else they've been working on. Their outdoor area is nice so you won't have to worry about being close to others.  If you're bar hopping, you should definitely stop here."

Our wonderful, fantastic, stupendous Yelp CM's open fare-thee-well was hosted here, and there was SoFlo Pizza to be had, drink tickets for Elite Yelpers, and overall just a fantastic night to rub elbows with the coolest Elites in SA.  This was my first time at DorÄ‡ol and I can guarantee you it will not be my last. This is a super hip distilling co with some ultra smooth drinks. Yeah, I'm used to paying $10 for an Old Fashioned, but the $12 Old Fashioned here totally rocked my socks off. It was smooth, it was subtle, and it had a giant branded ice cube. BRANDED. ICE. CUBE. SO DOPE. Those of you who know me know I always judge a bar by their OF. This one takes not just the cake, but the whole bakery, y'all.  The mixologists/bartenders were witty and fun, and made excellent recommendations. I had the porter, which wasn't as malty as I had hoped, but still hearty. Then I had that memorable Old Fashioned. Not gonna lie, I think it beats out the one at Eddie V's. Then I had the Mother of Pearl which had Absinthe, and that had me seeing fairies for about an hour.  I took a couple of minutes to write a Thank You card to our wonderful CM Tomas, and schmoozed with fellow Elites. (this review is also their notice that I got home safely. I see you Adam, Brent, Aurin, Raven, and Joey.) I had an amazing time watching people dance, play with the giant selfie light, and enjoy some top notch drinks.  Now that I know where this place is, and how incredibly smooth their cocktails are, I definitely want to come back. Especially for that Old Fashioned. Holy yum, y'all."

                "description": "It's a favorite!   They make their own brandy and then build an array of cocktails from that single brandy. Their cocktail menu changes slightly over time, but the favorites seem to stick around. While I enjoy their variety, I always go back to their Ups and Downs. It's the best. It has slight coffee and chocolate flavor and just a tinge of sweetness (which is perfect for me). And it finishes extra nice as it has a maraschino cherry waiting at the bottom for you. They also brew beer there, but that's not what I'm there for! I hear its good, though.  It's relatively small bar. The front section is extremely small, but there is a back area next to their distillery pieces. And when the weather is nice, there is a bunch of seating outside, where they occasionally have live music at. It's generally not busy, which I enjoy, as well. Overall, it has a nice intimate feel.   The only complaint I have about this place is that they only open Thursday - Saturday, and they close early. :'(   The artwork is enjoyable and rotates occasionally. The jams are good, the servers are friendly, and the cocktails are the best. It's a great after-dinner drinks spot."

Then we had to turn around and then we got stuck on the other side of a long train...   The place is rather small but it is lovely. Great outdoor seating, some covered and some not. Our friend said they recently added the cinder block wall between the patio and the train tracks. Maybe for noise, maybe for safety? Unfortunately it cuts down on the breeze.  The bartenders are fast. Staff members are constantly walking around picking up empty glasses for you.  The menu is small but potent. The Bee's Knees was surprisingly small but effective. I loved the flavor and the color. It was very pretty... I also had their version of a Pimm's Cup and it was also very pretty and tasty. My husband enjoyed his beer and it came in a pretty glass.   This is a pretty place to have some craft beverages. I highly recommend you go to the icecream challange next year if you can.

                "description": "They're known for their rakia.  Rakia is Serbian/Croatian for brandy, it's made from apricots, and they distill it right here on location.  All the cocktails are based on rakia, the only other liquor I saw here was absinthe.    My friend had the Strawberry Port Cake (rakia, sugar, rhubarb bitters, some sort of strawberry liqueur, and other ingredients) and let me take a sip.  It was very fruity and refreshing.    Second cocktail up was the Mother of Pearl (it was the only cocktail I saw that was not based on rakia).  This was a coconut flavored drink with absinthe as a base.  Again, I just took a sip, but it was very good.  And I was informed that the absinthe was astounding - but what do I know?  All I can tell you is the drink tasted good.  If you know me, you know liquor and mixed drinks are not my thing.  I'm strictly a beer dude, so luckily for me, in addition to their famous rakia, they also brew a handful of their own beers.  I checked their online drink list before I went and saw a list of 5 or 6 brews.  I tried the Betty, a Kolsch that was light, crispy and tasty, but kind of watery and too much on the light side.  Not the best Kolsch I've ever had.  The bummer was, that after I finished my last beer, I was informed that there were taps on the left side of the bar that I hadn't seen.  Supposedly, they have a red ale that beats the pants off the Kolsch.  I'm going to have to make another trip down there for that one.  Cocktails are $10-$12, so yeah, it's a bit pricey.  BUT the bartenders do make an awesome and *consistent* drink.  Each subsequent drink tasted exactly like the previous drink. Cocktails aren't a science, it's an art.    The inside bar area is a bit cramped, but they have a patio area with tables and chairs to chillax on.    The night I was there, it started raining and they let us drag the tables and chairs into the distillery area, so we could take shelter from the elements.  Final verdict? YES, I would hit this place up again.  A very unique place technically not in Southtown, but close enough."

                "description": "\"Dorchal\" is a beautiful oasis for well crafted drinks. They have beer in addition to their own Rakia (brandy) - Kinsman. Alas I sampled the mixed drinks and then went on to their beer without having tried the Rakia neat. Their 'Mary Pickford' also features their home made grenadine. I also went with more bitter drinks like the Negroni Bianco, and their Paper Airplane. I think I liked the smoothness of the Negroni the best.     Had their IPA, not bad. And their Irish red ale.. twice. It was good.    With it raining we took to moving tables and chairs inside the distillery half. This allowed plenty of room and easy convo.    It appears since they are a drinking place that you can BYOF - bring your own food (or order delivery).  I \"sampled\" quite a bit more than I normally would. But 1) Tomas was a Tomastic enabler... Many thanks! 2)  I staved off a complete hang over with the assistance of Drinkwel before and after so I thankfully only woke up with only slight brain fog. I'm still testing them out, But they've worked rather well for casual drinking.      Again Tomas was most Tomastic presence throughout the evening. And again thanks and to the Dorcol crew for such a great evening and chill venue."

Dorcol is known for making a bomb Serbian apricot brandy (A brandy made of nothing but apricots imported from a family friends orchard), which I didn't get a chance to try; however, let's just say that they definitely don't disappoint when it comes to making a delicious drink! This place was lively on a Friday night and best of all; they had a DJ that was playin' all the jam!!! Yes, that was me swinging my hair and dancing THE.WHOLE.NIGHT!   The Friday I came, it was packed house! Many people surrounding the bar trying to order a drink. I can't blame them because I had front row seats at the bar and trust-and-believe I was not leaving until I had my drink in my hand. HA! Chris Mobley, one of the owners of the bar, was able to take my order as I ordered over 5 drinks for me and my crew. Chris was so patient with me and didn't seem frustrated, I totally appreciated that.   Chris also works with co-founder Boyan Kalusevic on this beautiful Dorcol creation! Kalusevic was born in Dorcol (hint the name of the business) and comes from a family that has a huge background in distilling.   They recently introduced craft beers and a mix of cocktails to the menu and I have to say, it's been a BIG hit! They have over 20+ drinks that are offered here.   They are only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights! Although I wish they were open more days out of the week, I will take what I can get! P.S- They have a good reason on why they are closed during most of the week. My understanding of it is that they spend the days they are closed to produce Rakia, a Serbian Apricot Liquor, which is what they are well-known for making!   This place is a MUST-DO on your bucket list of things to do when visiting San Antonio. It has such a wonderful hip vibe and friendly bartenders. I have to admit that this place can be great for private events: Birthday parties, Bachelorette party, College graduation? You name it, I am sure the owners can make something happen!"

THE SETUP  My buddy Savanna M. and I pulled the trigger on a couple of their specialties:  the Apricot Daiquiri and the Jack Rose.  * The bartender knew his stuff and it was fun to watch him in action https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dor%C4%87ol-distilling-company-san-antonio-2?select=NJNUUOgjOeWachlC_R3cjQanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  * And the drinks were AMAZEBALLZ, and that doesn't even fully do these hand-crafted cocktails justice.   https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dor%C4%87ol-distilling-company-san-antonio-2?select=MVENc2vf5knDycdeI5kEeganduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  And out in the courtyard where the DJ was laying down some jiggy mixed beats,  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dor%C4%87ol-distilling-company-san-antonio-2?select_video=m72rGVYwjmkPkY2xA5ezzwanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  HOT DOGS  The associated vendor was selling the most amazing goat-meat hotdogs.  Superb.and tasty.  THE LOWDOWN  If you're looking for the best cocktails in SA, you will find them here at Dorcal Distillery."

I immediately loved this place because it reminded me of the super-cool bars in Wynwood (Miami).  Industrial decor with painting by local artists sealed the deal, but what really got me were the drinks!  Their paper plane (one of my all-time favorite drinks) were amazing!  Warning:  they are tasty, but man, are they strong in a sneaks-up-on-you kind of way.  Most of the cocktails at DorÄ‡ol are made with the own apricot brandy.  I will definitely try the old-fashioned there next time!  I can't wait to return to DorÄ‡ol and work my way down their awesome drink menu!!"

They have a variety of signature cocktails to choose from and they all sounded interesting. I tried the mother of Pearl and the tea-kini. Both were great. Perfect flavor. Not too sweet and with the right amount of alcohol.   The outside bar has beer. On a Saturday night, they had a band in the patio. If you prefer to watch football while enjoying your drink, you can do that too. They have a TV in what seems to be the distilling room. Definitely a little of everything for Everyone."

We couldn't believe such a fun, chill place wasn't packed on a Friday afternoon. The cocktails were delicious and very varied - pretty much guaranteed to find something for everyone here. The bartender was polite, and the woman who greeted us gave us a little overview of rakia and some history of the distillery. It was a great experience and would love to go back if I get to visit again."

We had made many unsuccessful attempts at a visit and finally hit them when they were open. It worth the repeated efforts because this place is really cool.  Lots of attention to architectural details and art making it a very comfortable place to hang out. The cocktails they concoct using their products are outstanding.    In one word WOW for the whole experience and can't wait to go back when the outdoor seating area is complete.  Job well done"

I'm sad I have to let the city know about you but I feel it's town to disclose your location and have everyone else enjoy you like I do.  This is not your standard bar nor is this a place that holds itself to the uppity up fru fru spectrum that can be known around town. Nope they're genuine and stay true to themselves.  Located near the train tracks (which you honestly can't even really hear unless you're located outside in the patio) you'll see a beautiful lit patio available for you to sit at.  Once you enter the doors you'll see an impressive menu focused around the rakia that is made in house.  If you'd like don't forget to ask the owners for a tour as they'll be more than happy to give you one in the back!  I love this place and how low key it is. You'll have such an appreciation for craft cocktails once you come here.  Their interpretation of iconic and innovative drinks is simply impressive!"

However, we had our after party here after the I love SA YSB party, and I'm pretty sure no one told the poor bartenders that we were going to show up, since they were then deluged with yelpers.  It took me about 15 minutes to get a drink, but I tried the Brandy Alexander $10), which was delicious. It was fun to watch the bartenders make the drinks as well. The Spurs were playing that night so seating was kind of hard to find as well, they have a large interior section and exterior but between sports fans and the Yelpers, there were not a lot of places to sit.  There's a small tent that sells sausages as well, in case you get hungry. They also had charred artichokes that you could buy.  Overall, a nice craft cocktail and beer bar, I just wish that it didn't take so long to get my drink. However, you could tell that the bartenders were slammed and that they weren't expecting so many people."

We got a couple dozen tamales and order Gin drinks for the ladies and guys got the straight whiskey.  The gin drinks were priced at the craft drink price of $9.50, while the straight whiskey was $14.  Thought the whiskey was a little high in price, so next time I'll stick with a craft cocktail.

She also loves chandeliers, so when I saw there was a place called Artisan Distillery with chandeliers, I knew we would have to go on our vacation to San Antonio.  Because we were there midweek and it was Covid times, we were the only ones there except for the owner Nick. That was fine with me as I wasn't trying to pick up this stupid disease. Nick was very welcoming to us and our dog, and we promptly ordered happy hour drinks for herself and a dog cocktail. Yes, they have dog cocktails!  Nick was very hands-on in explaining his process and we end up getting two cocktails each because the first round were so good. Actually, my girlfriend wanted to have a third! But we hadn't even eaten dinner so we pay our bill after two rounds.  Nick said they're on the move soon so I imagine the space will be even better after that. But he was a great host and I would love to go back if I was ever in San Antonio."

Comfy chairs and couches to lounge on, and they have a nice little patio.    The tour of the distillery is very informative.  The owner explains all the magic that goes into making the perfect vodka.  Unfortunately, the good ends there.  I'm not a liquor aficionado by any means, but every time drink \"A\" or drink \"B\" was ordered, it was an entirely different taste and even a different color (it just depends on who you order it from).  At one point, I ordered the Hillbilly Moonshine, and the bartender asked me where I saw that one.  I had to show the menu and the ingredients to him.  What???  The \"consistent inconsistency\" with the drinks causes them to lose 3 full stars."

Finally you can bottle and label your own bottle to take home for $12 which the master distiller will autograph for you.  Then you can hang out at the bar and drink.

However, it was nice to sit back and enjoy the scenery, the photographers at work, bartenders at work and models at work.  I found it kind of weird there were kids there but whatever. There is also a patio area where you can sit outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had a lemon drop martini and because it was happy hour it was only $5.00. It was the bartenders first day and he did a fantastic job!!! I like this place and would definitely come back if I were in the mood for some vodka."

                "description": "Super cool concept of an artisan distillery! We took the your and learned a few great things about distilling vodka. The tour included tasters and we had the opportunity to bottle and label our own vodka bottle we purchased which was super neat! We tried 3 of the artisan vodka drinks and loved them! The interior design of the bar is super contemporary and we loved the look. Nick the owner and master distiller did a great job with the place. He is definitely a one man show, although a little extra help would've been good when there are large groups at the venue.  A couple cons: The group prior to our group tour was running behind so they were still around and very loud during our tour which made it difficult for Nick to talk over them and also for some of us to hear. The AC unit was out so it was pretty stuffy inside both the distilling area and the tasting room. Regardless we will be back!"

                "description": "I just realized I failed to leave a review when we did a tour back in July 2017 for my birthday weekend. The tour with Nick was really fun, learned a lot about vodka. It's a small distillery but the atmosphere is good for cocktails and they have a section to have a private party with a crystal chandelier. They make unique cocktails made with their vodka made in-house a Texas vodka and a Spike one made with a cactus. The vodka's are smooth! You can buy bottles directly there and what's cool is that you can fill your bottle!   So happy we toured Artisan and will come back when we visit back."

The tour was guided by a very knowledgeable tour guide and showed the distillery, best part is you end the tour with 9 samples of their whisky and vodka. The tour it's self is $5.00 but well worth it to try all 9 samples.  The location has darts, jinga and other table/bar games. The bar only serves Rebecca Creek products but all drinks are all made with high quality juice and syrups.  After grabbing a drink we headed to a cute picnic table and enjoyed live music followed by karaoke.  This place is dog friendly and also has a bbq food truck/shack. The bbq smells amazing and tasty."

The staff are always very welcoming and accommodating, and they're very knowledgeable on the drinks served there. We enjoyed the tour of their facilities when they were open pre-COVID, and we also enjoyed the outside tastings they're doing during COVID! They have many different flavors of whiskey to choose from, and we love every single one. Our all-time favorite has to be the Texas Ranger."

But when we arrived we had to pay a cover and then a few locals weren't wearing masks and it wasn't enforced for them to put them on once inside the bar. One of the employees wasn't wearing one either. While there were signs none of the employees behind the bar asked them to put one on.   I get that you have the option, but all bartenders, restaurant owners and places of business should make their employees wear a mask. Other than that the drinks were fantastic even w the $10 cover."

I just dropped in to purchase a couple bottle of TX Ranger so that I can use as gifts when I am visiting other states. It's not only a great whiskey but also a great conversation starter talking about the distillery just down the road from my house. Due to some restrictions though, I can only purchase 4 small bottles a month   but I can live with this, I guess I have to â€  Covid has definitely affected the hours of operations but the gift store is still open and they have some GREAT TX spirits as well as gifts.   Oh and let's not forget, they are definitely Military friendly offering Military discounts   Thanks Rebecca Creek for your spirits and hospitality"

My most recent trip was my third visit to Rebecca Creek to do a distillery tour and tasting and it was as much fun on the third trip as it was the very first.   You can't beat a FREE 20 minute tour and tasting of the five different liquor offerings they offer at this Texas gem. Every time I come I learn something new about the brand and their process and the tour guides provide their own unique flair to the tour. This time I had the pleasure of \"Nitro Nick\" as my guide and he was AWESOME! A perfect blend of humor, intelligence, and sarcasm :)  When you're done with your tour be sure to stick around and enjoy a cocktail outside on the patio or at one of the many picnic tables scattered around outside. With lots of games (jenga, darts, corn hole), live music on Saturdays and a man named Tommy serving up some of the best bbq in Texas there really is no better way to spend your day."

                "description": "I was kind of meh about going here. The Enchanted Rock Vodka and Rebecca Creek Whiskey I have had before and they are veryyy enjoyable. However, not being a huge mixed drink person I was apprehensive, also seeing that they only had mixed drinks- no beer or wine.  We chose a beautiful day to go! All of the seating is outside, with plenty of room for small or large groups. The drinks you can choose on the rocks or mixed- their mixes are delish! I stuck to the vodka with blueberry lemonades and other choices. All blended very well! I was surprised- I expected them to be too strong to enjoy.  We enjoyed a free tour of the distillery and got to sample the vodkas and whiskeys- all very good and learned why their liquors don't burn when you drink them (hint: they do it right). It was all started from a Texas State alumni and there is some history behind the name Rebecca Creek, which I never knew, and thoroughly enjoyed!  There is a lot to do- a good stand (not truck) on site, a live band (the All Nighters were preforming there- which btw are amazing and play everything from Pink Floyd to Foo Fighters), games such as darts, horseshoes and more. They even have a fenced-in dog park!  It's a cute place to hangout. Don't wait forever to stop in like I did. Drink local!"

Although the options for beverages are based around whiskey - obviously, there are also other refreshing options.

The younger gentleman taking the order was completely rude - absolutely zero customer service. We end up with an incorrect order, but couldn't tolerate his rudeness to go back and have it corrected."

We bought a huge bottle for our whiskey bourbon colleague who unfortunately couldn't make it.  So we hope it helps takes away her bronchitis. :)  Our tour guide Miranda hopefully had a lot of fun too because when you're dealing with a lot of marketing people, oh and one chemist, we have a lot of \"suggestions\" and plenty of questions. She was so nice and quite informative but more importantly was a great sport and smiled a whole lot. The tour wasn't long because you're right in the heart of it all, but it was worth it, especially when you get to the tasting part.   They have an outdoor area for games and we were all in as we continued to drink.  Luckily we had some food that we brought along to snack on. All in all, great place to visit, have a party, and more importantly have a drink! Stop by if your in San Antonio!"

I had originally been to Rebecca Creek Distillery back in 2011, and boy has it changed for the better!   I unfortunately cannot remember the name of the gentleman that gave us our tour, he was in charge of marketing, I do remember that. He was so kind, energetic, passionate about Rebecca Creek Distillery and knowledgeable about the distilling and bottling process. The tour was very informative, you actually go inside the workings and distilling of their spirits. This is where you get to taste their Enchanted Rock Vodka, Enchanted Rock Peach Vodka made with Fredericksburg peaches, Rebecca Creek Whiskey, and their Canadian style Texas Ranger Whiskey, which was sweet and had nodes of caramel and vanilla.   We had our cocktails made by Helena. She was great! So friendly, on top of crowd control and making cocktails FAST! I had the peach vodka mixed with lemonade.. that went down too fast! We purchased a few more cocktails (and if you check in on Yelp! you get $2 off your cocktail purchase! Woo!) We gathered outside on their covered patio, played darts and smoked cigars that a friend had brought. Apparently there is usually food trucks on Saturdays, but the rainy weather had scared them away..   Super cool - they have a dog park on premises!!   On Thursday, its steak and open mic night, Friday, it's happy hour, food trucks and karaoke, Saturdays is live music and food trucks and Sundays is whiskey and wag Sundays.   Dog park is open Thursday-Sunday.   Also - they have their own radio station!! You can listen online, or at Rebecca Creek Distillery.   Do yourself a favor and go check it out, be sure to tell Helena I said heyyy!"

Gabe administered our tour today and did a good job - he was engaging, informative and knowledgeable as he easily answered guests questions. Pretty cool little hangout spot outside with live music and Tommy's Zmoke BQQ, and it was a pretty cool atmosphere. Only major bummer to me was that the Old Fashioned was subpar. Call me high maintenance, but I had higher hopes for an Old Fashioned from a whiskey distillery. Otherwise this is a pretty cool place and they seem to be doing some good things to get the community interested and make them informed about one of Texas' few whiskey distilleries.   Cheers!"

The guide was very knowledgeable and you can even get a taste of their flavored vodka, they have a new peach flavor and it does smell real peachy. I'm not a drinker but I did get a taste on my tongue, it's the smoothest and real peach flavored drink. It does have a kick when the taste gets back to your throat. I don't see how people can drink it, but like most things it's an acquired taste. Their whisky flavored is that of a cream soda and I dipped my finger in a tasting cup, it smelled like a vanilla Carmel cream soda.  The taste to me was real strong. I can see why I'm not a drinker. I will stick to my sweet tea and virgin piÃ±a colada's. My next venture will be to go to a winery to see and taste real French wine!"

The gentleman at Sister Creek who served our wine did great. Brandy was very knowledgeable, personable, professional and kind. She is a walking wealth of wine/vineyard information. If you're looking to book a tour, short or long, I highly recommend this company! We were given the option for her to provide a little info and just let us vibe or provide us with everything. I love all things wine so I went for it all! I wasn't disappointed. (Btw she took magnificent pictures for us as well)."

Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

I highly recommend doing this tour if you're in town visiting or live in San Antonio. They also give military discounts"

Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

We did a private tour with just 3 and it was completely affordable, which was my biggest concern off the bat. Communication was impeccable from the get-go and our tour guide Matt was such a blast. We hit up 3 wineries and a distillery that made moonshine. Each one was small and unique where we were really able to  converse with the staff and talk about the wines. Due to us having a small group we never felt rushed and when we asked for an extra few minutes, Matt easily obliged. I will definitely be going back for another tour!!"

We did the tour that consisted of two wineries and lunch in Fredricksburg. It was great!  Brandy and Matt think of everything! We were picked up in a clean van right at our hotel, so don't worry if you don't have a car! Matt even bring out a step stool so you don't have strain to get into the car. I didn't need it necessarily, but I did enjoy that extra touch. They gave us goodie bags while we drove to the country side. Matt is very knowledgeable and is a great guide of the area. He is full of little facts about the area!   The wineries we went to were very cool! Sister Creek was in an old cotton gin and more personal. Becker's was more upscale and large. we ended up getting 6 bottles of wine altogether. I was so surprised by the amount of good wine grown in Texas! Who knew?!!  Pros:  Brandy and Matt think of everything!  Don't worry about paying anything at the wineries- they take care of that! Transportation Good wine Great tour of the area Brandy and Matt are friendly and great at conversation They really know their stuff and love to explain anything about wine!  Cons:  I had a hankering for some cheese! But that's all I can think of!"

The grounds are beautiful, ample amount of parking. There are rocking chairs on the covered porch, picnic tables, plush chairs and ottomons, bean bag toss and bocce ball set up outside with fans.   There are a few tables inside the tasting room, along with the bar, restrooms, merchandise for sale and the distillery. The tasting room is right in the middle of the distillery, so you see all the working parts that go into making the gin and Cinco vodka.  They offer free tours on Saturday's at 3 PM, and request that you RSVP on their website. Trey, the owner, was the one who gave the tour. He is a fun and interactive guy, so you definitely will not be bored. We were able to taste their Cinco Vodka, Gin, Lemon Flavored Gin and Limeaide Gin. Then we each purchased a cocktail to take on the tour with us.   Fun fact - Seersucker was the first gin to be made with real fruit juice, not just flavored. They also have trademarked the \"Southern Style Gin.\" Who knew this little hidden gem was in San Antonio!   Seersucker is pet friendly, as long as your pet is leashed.  They also pop fresh popcorn daily."

I prefer to park my car at the Pearl and simply take a Lyft so I don't have to worry about drinking and driving.   Seersucker Gin currently has three different flavors and they're deemed as a Southern Style Gin. The current flavors are lime, lemon, and neat. They distill everything on-site and they're super passionate about their product.  If you're a newb to gin, Seersucker is a great introduction to the gin world. It's very clean and is a great base for signature cocktails. You gotta try the bees knees. Literally one of the best drinks to have in the Summer.  They have plenty of outdoor seating and the patio is gorgeous. Have a Seersucker drink during the sunset and you'll be set."

Make sure to check out their new grapefruit gin.  I think I have a new favorite!"

We have visited the distillery three times now, and have been pleased with the atmosphere, the service, and the gin!  Family owned, this distillery hits the mark with its self-guided tours (guided tours are available by reservation), friendly and knowledgeable mixologists (there's no delayed gratification here... drink while you tour), and casual outdoor spaces.  So, take a leisurely drive outside the city, enjoy a refreshing Seersucker and Soda with lime, and throw out the jack for a friendly game of bocce ball. Cheers"

                "description": "Seersucker provides a really fun, different southern vibe for the San Antonio area! We came here on a Saturday and got here around 5- it was about a 40 minute drive for us from northwest SA. Even on Saturday they close at 7. My husband and I split a flight which included the cinco vodka, seersucker vodka, and the four gin flavors (original, lemon, lime, and grapefruit). They also offer/use topo Chico. Our group then proceeded to try/share a few of the drinks which all were good. You can buy bottles on location- it's $25 for 750ml. They also provide recipe cards which have very feasible/easy recipes for you to make at home. The outside area is cute and probably really enjoyable anytime other than the summer- but we couldn't bring ourselves to stand outside when it's 100 even to enjoy washers, corn hole, hibachi ball, or horseshoes. We plan on coming back sometime and trying out cactus land brewery as well while we are in the area- but they're only open once a month so that takes more coordination. Overall a cute little distillery and addition to SA."

I have not been able to drink gin neat before. Up until now, my favorite had been New Amsterdam. However, this gin was so delicious AND its local! Win - win!  I visited the distillery for the first time yesterday. My boyfriend and I went for a tasting and touring event. I absolutely loved the concept. The distillery is open to the public Thursday - Sunday. The bar is in the middle so you have the view of the whole place. There are lawn games and chairs so you can have fun outside. Rocking chairs on the porch make it feel so southern. It is a bit of a drive but it's worth it! The bartenders as well as the owner were friendly. I will definitely have to go back with friends!  FYI: They also make vodka!!!"

The outside area and inside tasting areas are so cute. When we walked into the tasting area, we were not greeted or welcomed. We kindly asked about recommendations and the bartenders kept cutting their fruit slices and wouldn't even make eye contact. We were the only ones there... Let's just say they need to work on their customer service. We probably won't make this drive again due to the unpleasant experience."

The tour included so much amazing food - you will not leave hungry. San Antonio Detours offers other public tours weekly and I will definitely be checking those out the next time I'm in town.

I liked his conversational style, and he was able to answer everyone's questions. The tour bus was very well-kept and clean, and I was impressed that the tour started and ended exactly on time.   There was not quite as much walking as I expected, since it was billed as a \"walking tour.\" However, I'm not surprised because we did visit so many locations (a mission, the King William district, and drove through the Pearl) that we had to drive between. Melvin packed a lot of sightseeing and history into two hours! I learned a lot about the areas of San Antonio that I visit frequently, so I am very happy with the tour. I would love to try more San Antonio Detours in the future, especially with Melvin. Two big thumbs up!"

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

She was friendly and very informative.  She helped make the experience exactly what I was looking for. I wanted less sweet wines and a winery with food options. Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They are organized and timely. If you're an out of towner like myself and decide to book accommodations in Austin they will pick you up from there and bring you back.   All of my future bookings I will definitely request Wade. He was very professional and personable, he made sure we were taken care of at each location on our tour. He also was more than happy to take our pictures along the way."

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.

She took us to amazing tasting locations, she knew everyone and we received first class service. She even helped with dinner reservations! It really was an amazing evening largely due to Jodie and the exceptional service she provides! If you are looking for a fantastic wine tour, get in touch with Jodie and she will ensure that happens."

                "description": "Ahhhh! So very relaxing! Jodie Meyer knew all the tourists' names and made sure we got to know each other. She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

                "description": "We recently went on a fabulous wine tour with Jodie on 4/15 and had a great time!  Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

The length of the tour was the perfect amount of time as well. I would definitely recommend this tour and can't wait to go back and visit again!"

                "description": "A great little start-up distillery that I believe is going to do well.  Stop by on a Saturday afternoon, and you will not regret it.  Today was my second visit in about a month, and it will become a regular place to visit. Mike is a great guy, and he makes a great product.  On my first visit I purchased the Kentucky Straight Bourbon, which is distilled in Kentucky and bottled locally.  This Time, I purchased Mike's Texas Bourbon, which he distills himself and ages in 7-gallon barrels, and look forward to drinking it as well. The Kentucky Straight is very smooth for a 110 proof, and prompted me to go back for more.  They also mix some wicked concoctions. Today I had a fantastic Old Fashioned, and a bourbon-based Mule.  My wife, who is not much for hard liquor, loved the Old Fashioned as well and she also tried a heavy creme or milk-based bourbon drink that she absolutely loved.  Give this place a try, and I can pretty much guarantee you'll be back.  Oh, and you might want to go around lunchtime, as he always has some chili simmering on a wood-fired kettle outside!  Also, Mike is a career veteran of our great US Navy, so if I haven't given you reason enough yet to stop by, I hope that does it for you!"

The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

We started at William Chris, headed to Pedernales and ended at Augusta Vin. The 15 passenger van was great for our group of 11. They offered water and took care of checking us in at each winery. David was a complete gentleman and carried all of our purchases and secured them in the van while we enjoyed our time tasting the different wines. He even dropped us off downtown so we would be on time for our dinner reservation."

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.  David also went above and beyond by making an extra stop for shopping/pie-indulging and by dropping us off at our dinner restaurant so we didn't have to walk from the visitor center where he picked us up.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.

My husband and I are not about organized tours all that much, but this tour was not an organized group of people like a lot of tours are. He went out of his way to text us even before the tour and recommend places for us to go. We loved him so much we even hung out with him after the tour. He is an awesome tour guide and a blast to hangout with and knows anyone and everyone! Can't recommend this tour enough!"

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

                "description": "Woody was nice at the beginning but there was miscommunication about lunch and he decided to take it upon himself to charge my credit card without my permission. I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

I called the number provided on the website and had a great conversation with Woody. He set up the perfect private winery tour for me and my friends on Sunday, since Saturday was full. It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes). Overall a great experience!"

We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

They were on time and very accommodating, went as far as going to buy a stool for my friend who has trouble getting up and down the steps to the van. The wineries they took us to were exactly what we asked for. We never felt rushed and they handled everything for us and we never had to lift a finger to do anything. I would 100% recommend them and will definitely be using them again!"

                "description": "We had a group of 10 girls book a wine tour through 830 Elevated this past weekend, and I could not more highly recommend this company!! They made the trip so easy, worry-free, and fun! Brayden and Deb were super communicative and gave us a wide variety of wineries to choose from. We ended up going to Baron's Creek, Signor, and Augusta Vin. Deb was our tour guide and took care of absolutely everything and was such a joy to be around. If you are headed to Fredericksburg and wanting to visit the wineries, you won't regret choosing to book through 830 Elevated!!"

                "description": "I came across 830 when our bed and breakfast cancelled our room and wine tour reservation (due to remodeling) a month before our 10 year anniversary trip to Fredericksburg. I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

We were able to customize our winery stops which was not the experience we had previously with a different wine tour company. We spent the day with our group of four instead of getting shuttled around with strangers to fill seats (which I really prefer)! We requested a charcuterie board in the vehicle and Brayden picked it up while we were at one of our stops. We will definitely be back and use 830 Elevated for all of our future trips!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancÃ© and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

I can't be very negative though about service since they didn't charge me for an ornament I dropped and broke.  10% of bottles for military."

The ordering process was fantastic with lots of recommends. We were checked on frequently and just had a wonderful time interacting with the team of ladies that made sure to take care of us.  The wine was great as well.  I would definitely recommend stopping in to grab a drink.  The live singer was a real bonus.  Not sure how often he is on schedule but sure you can call ahead to check."

The wines are made there, although we think they are similar to any wine making kit you can buy online and do yourself at home. I didn't find a favorite wine this time, but I'd try it again. It's a great place for a group of friends to come and try some wines, and they're at decent prices. You can also bottle your own wine and create labels if you have an event or something - super cute!"

I found that I'd take my chances w/the sweet blueberry wine and it'll be cheaper and more rewarding ($15+ per bottle).  The only thing I didn't like too much was that the wine wasn't cold.

This is the only winery in the city of San Antonio which I thought was pretty cool. Stray Grape has an extensive selection of wines. I was very impressed by the selection and the taste of these wines.   We went to Stray Grape on a Saturday. It was the day of the Kentucky Derby and it was packed. When me and my fiancÃ© first walked in we thought we may have walked in on someone's private event. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by one of the employees and they were very friendly. We instantly felt welcomed by the employees and the regulars.   I recommend others try some of their Port Wines, they are to die for. For being the only winery San Antonio and having the market cornered they still treat you like there's competition in the city. People are friendly, prices are reasonable and the wine well, it tastes fantastic.   If you're looking for something to do and want some free wine tasting, this is the place to visit. Me and my fiancÃ© will definitely be back."

                "description": "First, I'll make it clear that I've never been to a wine tasting of any kind before. However, after trying this place, it's totally something I want to try more often! It doesn't look like much from the outside; it's part of a small shopping center. But you walk in, and it's comfy and nice. There weren't that many people there, we went pretty early during the day, so I'm sure it gets more crowded in the evenings. There are multiple TVs and plenty of tables. Our server was knowledgeable, fast, and friendly.  For a mere $10 you get to taste 7 wines AND keep your glass! They give you little paper menus to keep. This was helpful as I underline each wine I tried so I could keep track, and even make a plan for the next time I go. My sister and I enjoyed tasting the wine, then writing how many stars we gave each out of 5. They have a pretty solid variety to choose from. Cabernet, Merlot, Moscato, all very different with varying depths of flavors. Ask your server for recommendations! They are super helpful. I definitely want to go back soon."

                "description": "I recently attended a wine education class at Re:Rooted 210 and it was the experience I needed to make me confident in understanding wine. I am an avid wine drinker and have done the whole--look at the wine in the glass, smell, taste and savor. However, that was all for show. I can't be the only one who does this at the dinner table after the Somm pours a first \"taste\". What am I really tasting though?   Jennifer shared her extensive knowledge in her inaugural Tasting Deconstructed: Understanding Your Palate class. I learned how to look and taste through a Sommelier's eyes and mouth. I learned how to distinguish the color and age of the wine. I learned how to properly smell and identify scent characteristics that sparked core memories. Yes--wine can do that. I learned how to taste and differentiate if the wine was high acidity, high minerality, or full bodied. I learned all the things!  Going back to that table side pour. I was always going to enjoy the wine--let's be honest. However, now I feel confident to have a discussion about the complexity, the bouquet, or what memory was sparked. Instead of the typical head nod and \"It's good\"."

                "description": "After a nice dinner at the Chart House we took a short walk over to ReRooted and was pleasantly surprised and delighted with our decision.  There were a couple of regulators sitting there and the vibe was super friendly when we walked in.  The modern decor is amazing and the story behind it...... well you'll have to stop in and ask for yourself.  This is a really neat concept as you buy your wine in a growler bottle that can be used again and you get a small discount when you bring it back.  I will not spoil the experience for you, I will merely suggest that if you like wine and enjoy urban wineries, try it out, you will really like it and probably go back and more than likely join their wine club too."

There's a few outdoor tables, but the majority of the space is inside. It's nice and open inside with glass walls that fill the room with natural light.  The owner was very friendly and offered us a full complimentary tasting. She bestowed us with knowledgeable about the wine, telling us about the grapes and how their flavors incorporated into each final product. Their wine is made locally in Fredericksburg, and many of them hold the honor of a having a San Antonio name. It was very enjoyable learning about the drinks. And they were delicious!!  We ordered a charcuterie board and the cheese was perfect! Each cheese had a complimentary dipping sauce. Ah, they were all great combos. Next time I'll ask about a meatless option.   You can purchase either a glass or growler. And they're reasonably priced. The menu includes the tasting notes of each wine, which I greatly appreciated. They're still relatively new and said they'll be adding more options in the future. We had a great time here, and we look forward to coming back and enjoying more local wine."

Nothing off the charts - I must say I consider myself a professional wine taster or connoisseur so I wasn't over impressed but I must say the service was good. The prices were a bit over the top (and I don't have cheap taste). Overall, it was an okay experience. You have to pay $15 to park in the garage to come here no matter how long you stay. We had a cheese and meat platter and each had a tasting, took 1 bottle and it was well over $100"

It's a bit difficult to nail down an all-encompassing descrition of what's going on here, but here goes:  -custom crush urban winery featuring ALL TEXAS wines. If you're new in town and considering a US 290 wine trail trip, START HERE! An amazing amount of knowledge to be had regarding, varietals, production techniques, and personalities in the Texas Hill Country wine scene. Can't think of too many other folks bringing Jennifer's years of experience and general wine knowledge to the community in a way thats approachable/informative regardless of your prior background as a wine consumer.  -neighborhood wine bar with a selection that, while not in the dozens in terms of selection, has something that should be pleasing for just about every palate, regardless of your \"usual favorite\".  The cheese/charcuterie plate available makes for a great addition also!  -retail wine outlet featuring eco-friendly reusable growlers for everyday use as well as kegged wines for larger gatherings/events. At some point in the future, they're planning to have offerings from other Texas wineries on hand as well.  -winery tasting bar with a couple different \"wine club\" experiences available. Wine education seminars are also on the longer term horizon."

                "description": "ReRooted is located in a new building on the Hemisfair site.  Parking can be a bit tricky. Don't use the adjacent surface parking lot, like I did, but instead use the parking garage that is part of the building that ReRooted is located in. Much cheaper and I understand that ReRooted may validate your parking.  ReRooted 210 represents something of a new concept. I have watched owner/solemner/wine maker Jennifer Beckmann's career over the past ten years. She has been involved in setting up several fine wineries in the Hill Country (among her many accomplishments).  Now she and her husband are setting out on a new and, I think, relatively new concept. Recently opened, ReRooted features wines that Jennifer has blended and produced from Texas grapes. As such, these wines are only available at this location. Instead of bottling the wine, it is stored in recyclable casks and dispensed much like draft beer. Much friendlier for the environment. In addition to dispensing wine by the glass you can purchase the wine in reusable bottles much like growlers for beer. When finished, bring the bottles back for a credit on your next purchase.  The space consist of a bar for dispensing wine, an airy modern seating area and some adjacent outdoor seating.  Wine: We tried the sampler of I think six different wines and I was very impressed. The wines were well crafted and I think very similar to European style wines that I have had in the past.  Food: Food is limited to a very nice cheese and charcuterie plate and I believe one other selection that we did not try.   A great place to meet with friends and enjoy some very nice Texas wine."

First off, let me start by saying our driver Nate, was an absolute doll. He was the only good part about the experience with this company.  The company is called San Antonio Wine Tours, their website says they are based out of SA and pickup in SA. When booking a half day tour, their website says there is only enough time to go to dripping springs. So I booked dripping springs and requested and additional hour to have lunch. Upon calling to update my reservation I was told the extra hour I purchased would go towards travel time. TBF dripping springs is 1.5 hours from my home and they said ppl usually spend 45min-1hr at the wineries. That being said, why does the basic half day package say there's enough time to go to dripping springs only, which I chose, yet my additional hour has to be used for travel. It didn't quite add up.  So I explained this to them and was given the response \"oh, I guess the website needs to be corrected\". Also, they just asked \"do you want to cancel?\"  No attempting to right their wrong. I soon realized it's probably bc the deposit I put down was non refundable so they probably didn't care bc they already had some of my money. I was told that apparently they have been pulling this since they started 2 years ago and the website was supposed to have been \"corrected\" many times before this.  So buyer beware, this company practices dishonest and what I feel is shady  business. They also seem to not care about if the customer is upset and only about the money that can get."

However, the reason I can't give a better review is the limo.  We paid an upcharge for a limo, and the one that was sent was old and the AC/heat did not work properly.

I've never had anyone pair a wine to my pallet before. Five stars. We bought the bottle to have on the patio. Such a relaxing escape from the outside world. I heard they sold it today.

Michael, the owner was so sweet and humble. We tried the flights of wine and loved them all. Ended up getting a nice strawberry white wine. It's so quaint and comfortable. Weather was perfect, all screened in and they provide amazing pizza as well. Definitely going back and would definitely recommend Lara's!!"

They schedule by reservation to make sure not overbooked and everyone stays safe. I'm not a wine connoisseur but it is fun to try the wine flight. The pizza is very good as well as charcuterie. Always fun for a small group."

We love all their wines, especially the season ones like Fall and Winter Merlot. The cucumber chardonnay is also amazing. I am not a fan of cucumbers but this wine is very refreshing. They also have tasty pizzas and cheese and meat platters. Unfortunately they are only open one weekend a month. I believe it is the second weekend. This is a must visit place."

They also limit your time inside at table to like an hour if I remem correctly."

The meat and cheese trays are big enough for three people. We don't actually eat that much but, anyway, the peach wine and the Cabernet are definitely worth the trip. We were seated at the pavilion, and it was a record hot day for Oct. Also, finding this can be a challenge because their sign is not a stand out. I'd recommend this to any group but not on record hot day. They offered Brie but we're all in agreement to go again another day when it's COOL and getting the Brie."

Every wine was wonderful, but our favorites were the Zinpom and cucumber sauvignon blanc. The facilities are amazing and offer plenty of seating with great views of the surrounding hills.

The wine was excellent, we did a wine tasting for an affordable 12 dollars a person and Michael Lara came over and introduced himself and gave us complimentary pairings (strawberries and olives) so we'd have a better tasting experience. The vineyard was beautiful, the wine and the conversation with the friendly and personable staff (specifically Tara) was amazing. Overall a really fun experience with great people, I bought a bottle of their seasonal Strawberry blush wine, and we will be back next month!"

If you've been to Gruene you know parking can be a little bit of a nightmare, that is why we love to come to this place since they have their own parking and is also located near the entrance to the town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, with a cute little garden which is great for photos during spring. They have a decent selection of wines, which you can purchase by the glass or a bottle. If you are hungry, they also have a BBQ food truck but is not always open. Last but no least, if you are parent searching for a changing table, this is not the place for you. We had to change our baby inside our car, which was a little annoying since it was 90+ degrees outside."

They're right on the Guadalupe River in downtown historic Gruene TX. If you're having a bridal party, etc. this is an ideal spot with great social distancing and a recently added BBQ Food Truck. I'm not giving it more stars because 1) they're not growing grapes and 2) I'm really not impressed with their products BUT I don't like sweet wines which they specialize in from the looks of their menu. Their service was impeccable and quick and attentive even though it was a busy Saturday. Dog and kid friendly. Cheese and crackers available."

Winery on the Gruene is a small 'boutique' style winery that makes vino on the premise. There are a variety of vino's to sample at a reasonable price (4 tastings for only $4.00). If you know what you want and are a true vino drinker like me, you can 'go for it' and just order a glass (Vino Blanco in my case, $5.00 per glass; see my receipt).  The vino selection here is decent and the customer service is even better. The only facet about this location that is not great is the lack of room inside when you go for a tasting. However, if you have time to come here and have a glass of vino while you sit outside and enjoy a nice spring day, you will not be sorry.   Happy Drinking!"

                "description": "Wow, how have I not written a review about Winery on the Gruene?! It's like my best friend's favorite place to go in Gruene so I've actually been so many times... We've been visiting since they were at the original location down the street like ten years ago in one of the new strip centers on the outskirts of the little village of Gruene! Winery on the Gruene got lucky when this location became available, right in the center of Gruene!  Winery on the Gruene is located just up the hill from Guadalupe River about a block west of Gruene Hall. Great location, easy to find. Lots of room to sit inside or out. There is even space upstairs to sit or rent out for private parties.  All the staff have always been amazing... Thank you! That is always one of the reasons to go back to any business.   Winery on the Gruene is not a vineyard. Most grapes are not from Texas. Maybe not even any. That is my only complaint as I like to keep my wines local, although that is what works for these guys. They are not limited in their creations. They purchase grapes from all across the country to make their wines. They have a large selection on their menu, so you will find something you like. Winery on Gruene specializes in these sweet fruity wines, which is one of the reasons why my bestie LOVE them!  My favorite is Blackberrry Merlot. On my last visit for Tami C.'s birthday surprise, that is all I had... no need to sample, just give me a big full glass and I'll be a happy camper!   Yeah, you  know I'll be back for some of that Blackberry Merlot!"

Very charming staff and was helpful on wine tasting. We choose four wines to taste from their menu and have different emo fave on what we thought of the wine. I must say the tasting serving are healthy pour and provide the opportunity to enjoy a little more of each wine.  For me most of the wine was somewhat sweet and berry tasting as the Merlot wine has a hint of sweet berry. Reminded me of when I was had my first drink of Boonesfarm wine but not that sweet...lol.  Charming with that modern industrial farm decor.  I would come back to just sit on the porch with glass of vino. Cheers."

While this place is cute, quaint, and has awesome customer service, the wine we sampled was too sweet for my taste. We did a sampling and I chose a variety and was not impressed. This is just my palette though. If you're a sweet wine drinker, you will love this place. They do offer cheap tastings and a free glass which is also cool. I say go and see for yourself. Like I said the staff makes it a great experience."

The long line of people waiting BEFORE it even opened and the hundreds of preorders waiting outside had me excited to try their wine.   I was genuinely disappointed. The staff was friendly, incredibly thankful for the support and were moving fast so everyone wasn't waiting to long in the Texas heat. The disappointment was sadly the wine.   We ordered 3 different types: cranberry, blueberry, and the Malbec. The fruit ones were all watered down tasting. If you handed me the cranberry or blueberry flavored one and told me to guess, I'd honestly have no idea what I was even drinking. $15 a bottle and it tastes worse than the $5 ones you can get at Hâ€‘Eâ€‘B. I'm still crossing my fingers that the Malbec one is good.   Overall I do want to try them again just based on service because maybe I didn't order the best flavors or wine they have there BUT if the wine I got today is any indication on their products then I'm not sure why they're so popular."

Another sweet wine they have is the Strawberry Riesling, which is another favorite. My husband likes the Brunello, which is a much drier wine.  The location is beautiful, and the staff is very friendly and let us try different wines to see what we liked best. They also offer a military discount.   I highly recommend this winery. You can pop in just to buy a bottle or you can relax with friends and family and enjoy a glass of wine. There is indoor and outdoor seating available."

                "description": "Everything about Helotes Creek winery says southern charm. From the people to the ambiance. It is located in the old Bandera area and is surrounded by little cute antique shops/ bakeries/ and boutiques! There's are tons of tables and chairs outside on the patio under huge oak trees!   When walking inside you are greeted by all the workers at the desk. Once there you are handed a menu with the all the wines and the price for a glass/bottle.  At the bottom of the menu there is an option for wine tasting which includes trying which ever wine you would like and keeping a free wine glass for just $8! I did this option to get a chance to try all the yummy wine! They do offer discounts for teachers and military!   The majority of the wines they hand craft in house are sweet, and a few dry wines.  They get their grapes from California to Texas and Italy for some of their specialty wines! Aside from all the wines on the menu that they have all year around they also make seasonal wines, ports and frozen wine!   After trying majority of the wine. I picked my favorite, the Strawberry Riesling which was absolutely delicious. The strawberry wasn't over powering at all, I highly recommended you trying it and taking home a bottle. Or even drinking it at the winery outside or inside for a relaxing evening! My favorite part besides trying all the different wines was taking my frozen strawberry/watermelon wine outside and sitting on a patio chair in the shade while listening to Frank Sinatra playing over the speakers. I was truly in my own little heaven! I will be back on Wednesday for ladies night!"

Their known for making a variety of sweet wines, Reds, Whites and their delicious Port wines. The hit this summer is thier frozen wine slushies. They always have two rotating flavors and you can get them as a swirl if you like. On weekends you can get Sangria pitchers with fruit chunks added. If you get hungry order some cheese food trays to pair along with the wines. The place has plenty of seating inside and outside with oak trees providing plenty of shade. Make sure you check out thier merchandise, koozies and mini tumblers as well. You'll be happy you came and you'll definitely be back for more."

We came here for my bday so I guess it was a perfect time to come!   It wasn't busy at all. We got service right away, soon as we walked in. I had the wine tasting and the glass came with the price. I tasted 2 dry reds and 3 sweets. I ended up ordering a glass of Brunello and ordered my husband their Peach Chardonnay since he loves peaches.  I bought 3 of their wines and 4 of their summer size wine (similar to a beer bottle that's equivalent to 2.5 glasses of wine). Highly recommend this winery. The only con is they don't have that much wine selections and most of their wines are semi sweet- sweet. We will come here again in the future."

First, all the wines are made by natural fermentation (aka natural wine) with organic grapes- this winery is even featured in a Natural Wines book. The owner is so friendly and also has the sweetest dog. The decor is unique, interesting, and definitely sets a mood. The wine is delicious- we had a bottle of the \"on-site-only\" Lambrusco Pet-Nat, and we bought a couple others to-go. All the local websites were advertising Dry Comal Creek as the only local winery (and I'm sure it's great), but we stumbled upon La Cruz de Comal because Dry Comal closed at 5 and La Cruz was still open until 6pm. We will DEFINITELY be back for more organic, natural wine!"

The tasting room looks like a little cottage nestled in the French countryside.   The owner/winemaker, Lewis, is a piece of work. One of the most intelligent and yet one of the most obscure and eclectic people I have ever met. A true pleasure to meet and chat with.   Do yourself a favor. Check out the hours and plan to visit this little piece of heaven. You will be thrilled and so glad you did.   I highly recommend!!"

When we drove in, right away we noticed the winery's main building and it felt like we were in France. It is an authentic European building, small and cozy and welcoming!  The owner was there to serve his 100% estate grown grapes which boast of no additional acid, sugar or sulfites to his wine. The owner, who is a retired lawyer, Mr. Dickson, calls his wine, \"real wine.\" We tasted four wines and our favorite was the port, it had a smooth and delightful finish. There also is a sweet winery dog who loves to visit with the customers...we had a relaxing time there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to taste \"Real wine.\""

                "description": "I decided to take a trip and visit this place. I researched all the vineyards nearby but this place not only had the highest reviews, it seemed to have a nice scenery. The interior and exterior has french touches to it and you can tell each piece was well thought out.   Now the wine.... my husband and I FELL IN LOVE. At first the prices seemed to be pricey but once you do the wine tasting, you'll know why. The wine is so pure and has so much grace you have to walk out with at least a bottle (we bought three). I like wine but I'll only drink one glass because I get dizzy but when I went hope my husband and I both finished a bottle. The wine here has no sulfites and you can just taste the purity of the grapes.   Pricing: When you buy three wines the tasting fee is waived for one person ($15). The owner gave us a discount so after one wine tasting fee and 3 bottles of wine we paid around $160.   The interior is just lovely here you can just tell each piece in the room was placed there for a reason. The bathroom outside looked very old so I was very hesitant to use it but one you go in it is so cute and was not uncomfortable at all.   So, overall this place was an excellent experience!"

It is very obvious the owner should have stuck to being a lawyer. I understand the all natural thing. But it was awful. I tried to like even one of them or even find something interesting about at least one. With all of the time spent in Napa Valley and in France you would have thought the wines would at least be palatable. The only thing I can figure out is most of the reviewers don't drink wine. And if your thinking about going to see for yourself...I'm being nice in my descriptions."

                "description": "I love everything about this place! It's a hidden gem tucked away in the hills just south of Canyon Lake.  Lewis, the owner, is a former big-time defense attorney in Houston who found his calling to be one with the grapes and wine. Listening to him wax poetically about what he's doing differently at his vineyard gives you insight into what you're about to experience. He's also a hoot!   Instead of using commercial yeast, the wines ferment from wild yeast/bacteria on the grapes and whatever bacteria is in the HillCo air. This gives the wines an obvious farmhouse character (mild funk/horsey, slightly sour). He doesn't filter so the wines are a bit hazy and have some sediment/yeast on the bottom.   Grapes are either grown on-site or purchased from farms in the Hill Country and they don't add sulfites.  If you like traditional wines, you might not enjoy the wines that much but I still think it's worth a visit.  Tasting: $15 for 6 samples Bottles: Range from $25-$60 Times: Tasting room is open on Sat and Sun from 12p-6pm. What we bought: a bottle of Rose.  The tasting room is an adorable limestone building and the vineyard can be seen from the windows.   If you can't make it to the vineyard, Jester King Brewery just started carrying their wines in its taproom! It's a match made in heaven! Wild yeast for everyone!"

The tasting pours were generous and we enjoyed learning about the differences between their preparation methods versus the larger, more commercial vineyards.  I have to assume it's those differences that led to such pleasant flavors.  I've always been a red guy but found the first white I've enjoyed here.  Another first, I could really discern the various ingredients/flavors in each glass of wine, and the reds didn't have that strong bite to them.  I've been to Napa and Senoma, as well as France and Italy, and I just haven't ever enjoyed the taste of wine as much as I did during our trip to this little winery."

                "description": "We just left and I'm SO confused... I don't know how our experience can be so different from all the other Yelp reviews. We just parked, shared a tasting and left in about 15 minutes because we felt kind of unwelcome and found the wines to be awful. And we wanted desperately to love this place, because it is GORGEOUS. I'd have been very easy to please to be able to spend time in this beautiful place. But the owner was kind of frosty, barely spoke to us (but was more vocal with others), didn't tell us anything (not even the names) about any of the wines. I complimented him effusively on the place when we first got there and tried to get him to chat during the tasting, but he didn't thaw. I don't know if we made him mad because we chose to share a tasting?? We would've gotten a glass or two once we found a wine we liked. We felt like we weren't wanted, which when you're sitting at the little wine counter right in front of the guy, is really uncomfortable. I could've ignored all that if one of the wines worked for us, but I hate to say it, we thought all 4 were terrible. We drink a lot of wine, not cheap or sweet ones, and none of these tasted like anything we've ever had before. I'm confused that every other reviewer LOVED them and we had such an opposite reaction. We are at a loss for the experience we just had. The winery is so so beautiful though, it rivals CA wineries. So bummed. :("

We are no strangers to \"blink and you will miss it\" type of venues and we had the pleasure of finding this one. Thanks to Google, and an adventures mind set. Much like any other wine tasting, we knew we were in for a variety of wines, but like in a safari, we were fortunate to have a exceptional guide like Alex who had the passion for the business like a matador. He prepared the line up like a narrator in a Broadway play making sure that every bottle had the proper presentation utilizing decanters, air aerators and precise attention to serving temperatures. But that aside, the attention to detail that is given to the wines before they even become a staple for us to enjoy that matured into voyage that complimented the experience."

We stood there for about a good 15 minutes just admiring the beauty of the scenery. Once we made our way over to the tasting room we were promptly greeted by the staff and offered samples of a couple of their summer favorites as they were not offering tasting on that day due to a special 4th of July event. We decided to go with a bottle of \"Banana Split\" which was a very affordable $16 and great tasting selection (probably not for those of you who prefer sweet wines). Once we purchased our bottle we were able to go outside and continue to enjoy the beautiful scenery, live band,  very laid back patio. Like I mentioned, on the day we visited the winery was hosting a 4th of July event so there was a live band; I'm not sure that this is always an option. We had a great time and can not wait to visit again as it is only about a 30 minute drive from our home."

                "description": "My entire experience with Craft Cruiser was top shelf.  I booked this tour for my buddy's bachelor party, and Dan was super helpful throughout the entire planning experience (Covid caused some changes in group size and tour time.)  Mike was a super knowledgeable tour guide, and his choice in music for the van was fantastic. Mike was also super personable and answered the entire groups questions (Even if they'd been asked earlier in the trip )  The breweries and staff (Especially Dos Sirenos) that we went to were great, and the beer was even better.   The whole experience was fantastic, and If I am ever back in San Antonio I will definitely re-book.   P.S. Make sure to eat at least once on the tour so you can enjoy more beer"

                "description": "We booked craft cruiser for a bachelorette party in Fredericksburg and it was amazing! Everything was taken care of for us- we were picked up from our air bnb and driven to 3 wineries, then driven home. Dan did a lot of legwork making sure that wineries were open due to CV19, and letting us know what to expect. He even made reservations for us at two of the wineries we visited. In a very uncertain time, he took care of everything for us and everything went smoothly so we were able to have a good time and not stress about planning the wine tours! He made recommendations for places we could go and customized our tour for us. Our driver John was awesome! He was very friendly and took great care of our group (including opening the van door for us). He was very responsive via text inbetween each stop and always had the van pulled up and ready for us when we were ready to go. He also was our stand in photographer for our group at each location and was a TOTAL trooper. All around an amazing experience whether you're wanting a wine tour or brewery tour in the San Antonio or hill country area. And to make things EVEN better they cost about 1/3 of the price of other tours. Check them out!"

                "description": "We heard about this through a mutual friend of ours and wanted to do something different since my fiancee Steve was turning 40, so a big milestone birthday!  Dan was so helpful through the whole process from start to finish.  He provided a private link for me to send to our guests so they can each pay separately and choose an all inclusive for us beer connoisseurs or a pay as you go option.  We wanted to thank our guests and provide lunch we opted for Smoke Shack which delicious!  They were there right on time, plenty of food and even packed up our leftovers for us.  They picked us up and dropped us off so we didn't have to worry about driving which made the experience better as we all were able to mingle and chat.  We had an array of ages fro 21 to 65 and everyone commented on what a fantastic time they had they never knew San Antonio had something like this to offer.  Our drivers were laid back which is what we wanted but also professional and courteous.  We have some bachelor/bachelorette parties to plan in the future and will definitely keep Craft Cruisers in mind for our future celebrations.  Also a guest of mine already asked for contact info to start planning a tour of their own so what does that tell you! Thanks so much for making Steve's 40th birthday one to remember!"

                "description": "Craft Cruiser was amazing! I scheduled a private wine tour in Fredericksburg for a bachelorette party and everyone loved it! Our driver Matthew was absolutely fantastic and super professional. With other transportation services I have felt rushed and the driver is distant, but that was not my experience with Craft Cruiser! Matthew was super friendly and very knowledgeable of the area. He suggested wineries and told us what their best wines to try were. He never rushed us. He would drop us off and go in and make sure that we were set up with a tasting before he would hang back and wait for us. There was never a time that we had to wait for him, all we had to do was shoot a text and say we were heading out, and he would be there right out front for us. And if we were taking extra long, he would come in and check up on us to make sure that all was well. I will definitely be using Craft Cruiser again and recommend it to all my friends. Their private tour made our bachelorette party one to never forget!! Thank you Craft Crusier!"

                "description": "I was super excited when I came across the SA Craft Cruiser on Instagram! I mean what better way to spend a gorgeous San Antonio day than with beer and pizza?! I had never been to ANY of the stops on the tour, so I was looking forward to knocking some things off my to do list! Tours are always the best way to fulfill that list! I did the ALL-Inclusive tour. The ALL Inclusive tour includes:  *Safe transportation to each brewery *Brewery tours *Souvenir *Unlimited tastings *A meal on Saturday and Sunday tours  Saturday Tour: *Alamo Beer Co *Freetail Brewing Co.  *Busted Sandal Brewing Co.  Start time: 11am  The tour met up at Pizza Italia (a local pizzeria) located at 3023 Thousand Oaks Rd. Upon arrival the group was greeted warmly by Dan our host with most! We walked into Pizza Italia and were led to the bar where we were given a few samples chosen by Dan from the 30+ beers on tap. Dan offered samples on anything we wanted to try after that.  While we sat at the bar, pizzas were being ordered and waivers were signed for tour permissions. The pizzas came out pretty fast and we were directed to our table where pitchers of water were waiting along with cups. Tea and sodas were offered as well. A variety of pizzas were ordered for our group, from pepperoni and sausage to veggie! I loooove ranch with my pizza, so Dan must have read my mind, he came and placed cups of ranch on the tables. The ranch was so good!  I had the pep/sausage and it was delicious! Dan made sure we had everything we needed during our lunch! We had plenty of time to eat and converse with the people on the tour. After a great lunch it was time to jump into the Craft Cruiser.  I must admit when I saw the Craft Cruiser I wondered how we were all going to fit in there but we did and VERY comfortably! The Craft Cruiser was very clean and airconditioned well.  Dan had great tunes playing and took requests as well for our drive to the breweries.  Second stop was Alamo Beer Co. located at 202 Lamar.  While I've had their beer (Golden Ale is my fave) I had never been to Alamo.  I ordered a beer flight and each of the beers I tried were really good! Alamo Beer Co. is super cool and I enjoyed it.  (Sidenote: I had a massive headache that started before the tour and once Dan knew I had a headache he found some tylenol for me while we were at Alamo which was super nice!) Again we had plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy more beer!   Third stop had us at Freetail Brewing Co. located at 2000 S. Presa St. Freetail was very spacious! I loved the day of the dead themed art on the walls! It was very bright and super cool. I ordered a flight to start off with and all the pours were good! Dan made sure we were taken care and asked us if we needed more beer. Freetail has free popcorn, which was delicious and perfect with our beers!   Last but surely not least our final stop was the Veteran owned Busted Sandal Brewing Co. located at 7114 Oaklawn Drive. I honestly was not aware of this brand of craft beer until my tour. The tasting room was very small BUT they are working on expanding so you need not worry! We were totally comfy and the guests at the bar who were already there welcomed our group.   Mike DiCicco, founder, brewer and USAF Veteran greeted us in the back for the brewery tour. We learned alot about Busted Sandal, the process and future plans. We were able to see the canning process up close and personal which was super exciting! I never realized how much goes into the process of canning! I had a chance to weigh a few cans as well. Dan worked the canning line while we were there to help out. I learned that he volunteers at Busted Sandal to help support local which is truly amazing! After the tour we had more beer and were able to keep our pint glass! (If you bring your glass on Wednesdays pints are $3) Sadly, it was time to depart from our final stop and head back to our starting point Pizza Italia.    End Time: 5pm  Dan handed out koozies before we said goodbye! I totally enjoyed the tour! It was absolutely fantastic! I had the opportunity to visit places I've never been to, I met really cool people, and had a plethora of beer! I highly recommend the tour to people who live here or who are visiting! From couples, to friends, birthdays, bachelor/bachelorette parties, just because, and Sunday Funday it is the perfect outing! Dan was AMAZING and made the tour fantastic, he made sure we were all happy! I look forward to future tours!"

If you're looking for a legit brewery tour where you'll get to barhop at all your favorite local brewery's, start off with some legit pizza , and end with a great tour and souvenir glass, this is your tour to hit up!   I was very impressed with the smoothness of the tour and how it flowed throughout the day. It began at 11:00 am. and ended at 5:00 pm. Every Brewery we went to, we got to sample the drinks, and drink as much as we wanted all while having our DD ( craft cruiser shuttle us around town ). It was absolutely wonderful. I would definitely go on this with several buddies of mine who are beer drinkers. They also have wine tours as well! It was a clean, organized, and efficient tour with a knowledgeable operator."

We did the non all-inclusive which was good for me because I'm not much of a beer drinker but I had booked this for my boyfriend's birthday. Dan was super cool and made us all feel comfortable and safe as we made our way to the different micro breweries.  Everything was timely and we didn't feel rushed. We used groupon to get a rate discount. Even if we had paid full price it would have a been good deal to not have to worry about driving everywhere. The meet up place Pizza  Italia was also great - great pizza and it had a big variety micro beers.  I would have liked more upfront information about the beers each bar offers and how to get the most at each bar. For example you can order a flight if you want to sample different beers or you don't know what you like. At the first bar we each ordered a full glass only to not really like it. So we ended up switching glasses! Ha!"

Yep.  That's me.   However, Water 2 Wine in Seguin came to my rescue!   Not only are the folks here really friendly, they go out of their way to make you feel welcome and make sure you leave happy.   The place is very welcoming and warm, as well.   If we ever take a road trip, I have to admit, this might be stop on the way.  :)"

There was 5 of us and the first 3 wines we tried were free and let me say, we were smart about it and ended up tasting 15 wines between us 5, each getting a different wine and passing it around each try. I highly recommend the diablo wine! It's a dry red but super super smooth! The whites were all amazing! But the sangria's? #givemeabarrel they both were excellent! I will definitely have to bring my grandma back to wine taste!"

                "description": "We had a very enjoyable day yesterday, thanks to our memorable driver Lindy, the beautiful Texas Hill Country, the historic LBJ Ranch and National Park, the bustling town of Fredericksburg, the tiny but charming town of Luchenback, and the hospitality and great wines of Sister Creek Vineyards in Sisterdale. All this for $109.  We had 8 folks on the bus, so it was a very informal day where you got to know everyone. There were some issues getting a few of the tourists and the bus to the same rendez-vous point, but Lindy patiently made the phone calls and figured out where the parties were.  The mini van gave us a very comfortable ride and Lindy was an absolute joy and delight to hang out with for a day.  The only quibbles I have about the tour was a) the AC could have been better, and 2) I wish the seats would have had headrests for a snooze on the way back.  Well done, Gray Line and thanks for a memorable day."

                "description": "My friend and I bought the San Antonio Explorer Pass from Groupon at $84, which included one premium attraction and two nonpremium attractions; one of the premium attractions was the LBJ Ranch tour. The tour is operated by Gray Line Tours bus service so this review is for that only, not of the Explorer Pass and not of Groupon.  We really enjoyed the tour! I wouldn't say it's worth $109, but a Google search will yield you lots of partners selling the tour tickets at a discounted rate.   Regarding booking, we tried to call the toll-free number on a Sunday for a Monday tour (need to reserve at least 24 hours ahead), but the office was closed. However, the automated message directed us to a cell phone number to call to reach someone directly for booking. My friend texted that number--omitted here for privacy but obtainable by calling the Gray Lines Tours number--and received a response within 5 minutes, if that.   I also called a different number and left a voicemail message just in case, and I was called back within an hour or so and also texted. I really appreciate the effort on the booking agent's part!   Once we were in touch, we provided our San Antonio Explorer Pass voucher numbers over the phone and were told that pickup from our hotel would be at 8:30-8:45 am.   We made sure to be downstairs, ready, and visible from the street. The bus arrive within that allocated time. The bus driver called out my friend's name and we boarded. There were a bunch of others already picked up, and we picked up a few others along the way.  We made a pit stop for bathroom and food about an hour in. The bus driver was super friendly, passionate about his job, and accommodating of passengers' requests. He gave us a lengthy and useful history of the major landmarks, the towns we passed, the important people and what made them significant, and of course much information about LBJ and his wife, Lady Bird.  We stopped by the Boyhood Home of LBJ, the Texas White House on the LBJ Ranch, and saw many animals including longhorns up close and personal. We also got to check out the Air Force One-Half, the plane in which LBJ flew.   We stopped by Fredericksburg TX for 2 hours to enjoy Main Street and have lunch. The pickup spot was easy to find. It's a huge bus after all!  We also stopped by Luckenbach, a small centralized area of land in a town with a history of music and German migrants.   We opted not to stop at the optional winery based on another majority vote.   We were driven back right near where we were picked up and were back to our hotel around 6pm."

Nevertheless, we toured Texas Hill Country and it was a good time. Definitely oriented more towards adults (my 15 year old brother was BORED). The day got a late start which put us behind schedule the entire tour. The driver appeared the be in training and the communication between him and his trainer was poor. But other than that, it was enjoyable! Great way to see LBJ Ranch, Fredericksburg, and Luckenbach all in a day."

                "description": "My husband and I took the LBJ tour. This tour could be 5 stars, but the one we took today was barely a 3-star.  Enjoyable things - the trip itself - there were only three of us and the scenery was nice.  The van stoped at the childhood home as well as the \"Texas Whitehouse\" home of LBJ with tours of both.  It also stopped in Fredericksburg for lunch.    The issues:  1. The driver isn't trained to know anything about the trip.  There are canned recordings that often don't line up with where we are.  Questions to the driver are answered with \"I am not sure but maybe...\"    2. For some reason, we had to switch vans midway.  The second van was very noisy (the engine as well as the rattling of the door) and you could not hear the recording at all.  Also the cover for the air conditioner on the top of the car flew off.  We retrieved it, but it was broken and the air conditioner stopped working.  It was up to almost 100 degrees in the van by the time we got back to San Antonio.  If GrayLine took the time to train their drivers to do the commentary (with a speaker system that could be heard) AND ensured their vans worked well, this tour would be a 5 star.  Apparently, the van the day before (a different one from both of the ones we were in) also lost its air conditioning too.    Definitely better than the hot, and crowded amusement parks!"

It was great to sit back, relax, and be toted around the Texas Hill Country. Each stop was somewhere I wouldn't have thought to stop at on my own, but I'm so glad for each stop! The only reason I didn't leave 5 stars is because we had a late start, and somewhat poor communication about the delay. Once we got rolling though, it was a great experience! I would definitely do something like this again."

                "description": "My husband and I were in town for a wedding and decided to arrive a day early to take the Texas Hill Country and LBJ Ranch Tour from San Antonio.  Our driver and tour guide was Ray.  He was friendly and knowledgeable.  He was fun and quick witted, which we enjoyed.  Ray was great and overall we give him five stars.  There were a total of ten of us on the tour, which was a nice size. I do think it was too much to pack into one tour.  There could easily be an LBJ tour on its's own and another tour of Frederick and Luchenback.  I don't think we had enough time to spend at the LBJ Museum and probably could have used more time at the LBJ Ranch.  In Fredericksburg there are two museums, shopping, and Das Peach Haus.  Das Peach Haus is own for wine tasting, gourmet sampling, and peach cobbler.  It is in a wonderful location.  Outside has nice sitting areas.  We bought some delicious sauce and peach cobbler to go but had to race if we wanted to get through the Pioneer Museum.    Our group was given the choice of how much time to spend at each location but I wish this tour we would have provided specific times.  There is too much to do on this tour and in reality it is two tours in one.  My husband and I returned on Sunday to visit the National Museum of the Pacific War (it takes about five hours to complete).  I would suggest to Gray Line Tours to split these tours."

                "description": "First things first: JS is about quality not quantity!  I cannot believe I only recently discovered this store, it is truly a diamond in the rough. You will find this gem of a wine store nestled within a warehouse/industrial area. Even though they've been in business for decades they do very little advertising as they prefer the \"if you're in the know, you're in the know\" type of clientele and, yet, they have the kindest and most attentive staff waiting to greet you when you walk in.   This is the mecca for San Antonio oenophiles. I was wary of even writing a review as I want to keep this place a protected institution but I decided that if I did the review any justice then the right people who truly appreciate wine would be as thrilled as I was when I discovered this store.   If you are looking for cheap, mass produced wine then this is not the place for you. This is a boutique wine store with down to earth employees who have a passion, love, and (most importantly) expert knowledge of wine. Here you will find an unassuming building and space that has a \"home-y\" feel to it. Different staff have different areas of expertise just let them know what you are looking for - French, California, etc. What I personally appreciate is their flexibility to accommodate the needs of each patron including budget, grape, region, drinking now vs storing, building a collection,  etc.   Every wine that is on their shelf is there for a reason they are all hand picked and oftentimes from lesser known but \"well kept secret\" types of wineries throughout the world. Even more impressive is their willingness to educate and share their knowledge of the wine, winemaker, wine making process, etc. This is not a place where you run in, grab a bottle, and go home. When come here you can expect an experience - you'll be here for quite some time walking through different options, discussing and being educated on wine!   It would be remiss of me not to mention that they also have liquor and specialty cordials on hand as well, in fact, they have an entire room dedicated to them. I tend to focus on the wines  and their impressive collection which transition from region to region - Italian, French, Austrian, German, California, a handful of Texas wines, and then a hodge podge of miscellaneous \"must try\" unique wines (I'm sure I missed a few key regions my apologies in advance). I've never had a wine I didn't like from JS but more importantly I've been introduced to wines that I normally would have never tried or considered. Thank you, JS, for broadening my experiences of wines and challenging my palate in all the right ways.  A special thank you to Chelsea, who made our first visit such a wonderful experience that we are now becoming \"regulars\". We always look forward to engaging with her as she shares her love, excitement, and knowledge for French wines!"

I googled and found this liquor store by her house hoping they can deliver (of course assuming the recipient can show ID). And they agreed! Delma was so amazing and even texted me pictures of the different offerings they had. We chose a nice bottle for her, and they wrapped it up and delivered it. It truly made her day special and my life a lot easier as you can imagine the difficulties of finding something special to give to an amazing mother in law. Thank you Delma and JS!"

                "description": "Another Saturday came and went so I did the usual which meant a trip to Saglimbeni's for their weekly wine (and sometime fine spirit) tasting.   Here's the thing, they have an unrivaled selection of wines and a hearty selection of high-end spirits. The tastings are always attended by a person \"in the know\"-- who can explain the experience in terms of source, what you should expect on the palate, and what you might team each selection with.   This time, I came away with a light, crisp South African Sauvignon Blanc I'll enjoy with the Springtime weather, and a subtle fruit old vine zinfandel. The latter is not the sweet stuff the kids drink, the flavor is more sophisticated to be sure.  The creators of Mar Azul tequila were also on hand with a full complement of their renderings. They produce a fine, peppery silver tequila along with a delightful reposado and anejo. Additionally, they have a host of what I'll call infused tequilas. Not flavored artificially or colored. These are distilled spirits. I tried them all, each very good.   I settled on banana and almond. Yes, banana tequila. It's wonderful and will be drizzled over each serving of my homemade banana pudding. I'll use the almond in my flan and in a cranberry yellow cake I've perfected over time.   I also picked up some of the fine balsamics and olive oils made, and distributed by a local vendor who shares space there. I've been cooking with these a couple years now. The new balsamic is key lime, I'll be serving it drizzled over tangelos, fresh mozzarella and basil for a light summer salad.   Although I didn't make time for the food truck, it was there. JS's is the perfect place to spend a couple hours, discover some great finds, enjoy a lunch outside at the picnic tables maybe over a newly-acquired bottle of goodness. Great place to meet friends who might enjoy the same. And to wrap this package up nicely are the employees--all friendly and professional. This is a regular go. Find time to treat yourself."

Perfect being inexpensive. This did bot bother them at all. Take in can you to treat me as Well as any of the other customers  Who were all better dressed than I.  Those who might feel uncomfortable in nicer liquor stores will feel  Quite comfortable because while they are extremely knowledgeable they are also not  Pretentious in  any way. It is hard to find such a good combination of quality and down-to-earth atmosphere especially in the world of liquor and wine.

I was greeted right away and they directed me to the Sardinia, Italy collection in the back. I was looking for a birthday gift for my husband who studied abroad there 20 years ago. Sardinia is a very small island off of Italy, (I was thinking maybe they had one or two choices) and the store surprisingly had a collection of about 10 wines from the region varying in prices. Will def try again!"

You have got to check this place out if just to be in awe of their wine selection.  Are you a Scotch drinker?  Look no further.  You can get a $40 single-malt or a $600 50 year old Islay.  The staff is very nice and all of them are very educated.    Check out their wine tastings on Saturdays, for an extra special treat!   This is my favorite liquor store, EVER and I have lived all over the US and visited stores in many places and this is still THE standard that I hold other wine stores to.  Needless to say,  this is the HANDS DOWN best wine store, EVER.  Enjoy!"

                "description": "Warning: this is going to be a rant.  I've been here twice now on Saturday for the wine tasting.  The first time was very enjoyable and it was just as Aliyah described in her review.  Everyone is nice, the atmosphere is very social, and  I even went home with a bottle of saki.  This weekend I went again and discovered half the crowd was the same (they must be wino's :).    My girl and I visited the front bar for a while, tried all the wines, then the back and did those as well.  I wanted to return to the front room/bar to check out some bottles on the shelves.  As I was reading a label, the employee behind the bar (different than the one from earlier) loudly said \"Hey, hey YOU! Come over here.\"  At which point he pointedly asked for my identification.  Reacting to the puzzled look I had, he offered that even he \"gets carded at the airport.\" huh?!  I have no trouble being carded in liquor/wine stores.  However, a logical policy would be to card people when they enter the store, before they are served a sample, or at checkout.  I had already been in the store for almost an hour trying the wines and I didn't see anyone else getting carded.  Also, I was in the middle of browsing!  Totally unprofessional, -3 stars from an otherwise 5 star review."

All items are 20% every Friday and Saturday.   That includes wines, pastas, spices etc.  Their overall selection is pretty satisfying and IF it is not, they may be able to order what you are looking for on your behalf.   Grappa, an older black lab that is an animal companion of the Saglimbeni family, can be seen begging for treats - don't feed him but do give him a pet on the head.  By treats I mean the yummy bread and olive oil or pate that is complimentary at each tasting.  In addition Joe's has cute napkins, gift baskets and greeting cards for sale.  Standing space can be limited and the place can get packed, but Joe's draws a nice crowd so enjoy."

Every major growing region and varietal is well represented.  The staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  My wife and I have attended their FREE Saturday afternoon wine tasting 3 or 4 times.  Each time, we've enjoyed several tastes of whites, roses, and reds and naturally took home a few bottles.  In addition to wine, they have a crazy selection of spirits, many of which I'm sure you've never heard of or tasted.  The building is an odd maze of connected rooms, each with a different theme or feel.  This is wine heaven.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

                "description": "3.5 Stars  When I think of the fine art of wine drinking I always defer to Alexander Payne's film, \"Sideways.\" While I did like that movie it has never really inspired me to partake in the vino. Not in the way it has inspired that industry. Nonetheless I never discount the passion of that specific community. As a craft beer enthusiast I try to keep an open mind and an open palate.   So I was invited to attend this event with my partner in crime. Both of us are novice wine drinkers. Did this bias my review? I tend to think any experience can supersede or dash our expectations by its own weight. Typically Texas Winos does a bus tour where you visit different wineries. This particular festival was held in of all places a civic center meant for wedding receptions, birthday parties and quinceaÃ±eras. Personally I have no qualms attending an event at a muddy field, a dive bar or at a boujee affair. I'm wondering if attendees were disappointed by the not so upscale provisions?  You purchase tickets online. It's slightly cheaper the earlier you buy them. You pick a time slot, which are in two hour increments. This is mainly to control the size of the wine demos, but I'll come back to this point later. When you check in you are given a sheet with all the wineries participating. You go to each table with accompanying wines and each label does their spiel. The manner in which sample tastings were handled confused me.   Basically couples of two, a group of friends  and a few stragglers at a time would go through a demo rotation. Some stations had multiple wines, thus you would have to wait awhile before you got to any tastings. Once you went through each offering: chardonnay, pinot grigio, merlot, white, red, rosÃ¨, etc. you would be done. Which in hindsight probably did keep the lines at a minimum. However you would be in one line and a group of twenty friends would camp out, with little regard that others were there for the same reason.   In addition I felt there was little time to process each pour. You couldn't move on to the next style of wine without first finishing your sample. Which felt like a class moving sometimes in rhythm but most times at a snail's pace. For the most part demos were very informative. Surprisingly the wines I liked best were done by presenters who served as gracious hosts. But there were a few who were so snooty, to serve me was to undermine their vineyard.  Speaking as a craft beer enthusiast I understand every drinking community has its own set of implied manners. At this event what subtracted from my experience was having ultra pushy festivalgoers. For example I was in one line in the midst of a tasting and some arbitrary dude tapped me on my shoulder to move. In another whilst an owner was presenting her wines \"homeboy\" asserted himself, completely ruining my experience. You would be waiting in one line and people from nowhere would impolitely cut in. Is this typical behavior at a wine festival?  As a beer drinker my credo is to \"To drink and to let drink.\" Not to say there is complete civility and organization within the craft beer community. It's just that I left feeling a bit hollow. Yes, lines were kept to a minimum but after the rotation the experience felt anticlimactic. I will say one bright spot was a festivalgoer, named Lauren who was having way too much fun. She offered her suggestions on which wines to try. I wish her friendly spirit would've been sprinkled on the crowd that day.   I think if you like wine and want to get sauced for a reasonable price I say this event is for you. It's interesting that a grape, a peach or a strawberry for that matter when fermented can make you tipsy. With alcohol beverage volumes at 12 percent and up I don't expect you to be doing the, \"Achy Breaky Heart\" perfectly. I'm trying hard to be open minded about wine and maybe I will find one that suits me. But a scene where people are too egocentric, classy gals drop sample glasses and there's no variation in flavors between samples. Well I guess I'm doomed to be a beer guy. Tear."

We had about 20 minutes at each place. Felt extremely rushed. Not once were we told what type of wine we were drinking or how to drink it (like you expect at a tasting). At two of the stops we didn't even have time to buy a bottle because the line was too large and the bus would leave us. The driver/host got lost on the way to the wineries twice which added 2 hours to our drive time. We calculated it later and we were on the bus for 6.5 hours and we only had 1.25 hour(s) between all the places. We ended up getting off the bus at 8pm just exhausted from all the driving. We would have been better just getting a bus ticket to a neighboring state and just bringing wine on that drive lol. It's sad because this tour used to be fun and informative with a good sit down tasting at each venue. Now it is just poorly run and communicated. I would not recommend this tour anymore. Also we met three other couples on this tour. They all had been on previous ones with this company and they all were saying the same things we were. They honestly should have just refunded this tour. Maybe we were just a one off bad tour, but I wouldn't give this place another try unless they guaranteed a better experience. It was just awful all around."

Their watermelon wine was a hit with our group. 290 Vinery had some great dessert wines. Purchased a strawberry riesling here which was delicious.  We had a great tour guide. The music was dated and not much of a mix but he was able to change some of the music as the day went on. There were a couple of us who were celebrating birthdays. Do bring snacks with you to eat. The BBQ at Vino was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I would purchase a groupon again for this but int feel full price is worth it."

When you buy the groupon, you still have to go to their website and register and pay a fee ($72 for both my wife and myself). Everything went smooth until we received an email that there was an issue with processing the payment and that we were most likely affected. The issue was that the processor for their credit card had mistakenly changed the decimal point, so we were charged $720 instead of $72. That's a HUUUUGE difference.  So after I emailed Richard Wino, he said the problem was being taken care of and that they will be processing the correct amount. 1 day later, we get ANOTHER charge for $720 on our credit card, so now our credit card shows that we paid $1440 to Texas Winos.  I emailed Richard Wino again and told him the situation. He responded quickly and stated that he is going to cancel all of the transactions and they weren't going to charge us for the $72 either. Richard Wino even offered to give us complimentary tickets to another even because of the errors. My wife and I were delighted and told him we would love to go to the Wino Fest in November and he said he would take care of it. Well, he didn't.  It took about 1 month to get the refund on my credit card. Really slow compared to how fast they took $720 from my credit card TWICE. And even after going through all that, I thought it was ok since they were being nice and apologetic and offered us complimentary tickets to another event. BUT, we never received our complimentary tickets to another event! I know they're free, but what bothers me is that they went back on their word, and THEY STOPPED RESPONDING TO MY EMAILS after the amounts were corrected. I tried emailing Richard Wino a few times since the end of October when we were told that the WINO FEST HAD BEEN RESCHEDULED AND THEY FORGOT TO NOTIFY US (But we never received tickets or anything to begin with). I know that they were free tickets offered and shouldn't be petty, but when someone goes back on their word and stops responding to emails, it bothers me. What if I had been charged the $1440 and he never responded or even attempted to correct the situation? I am attaching emails which have time stamps of the conversations   PS. The tour bus driver and guide were awesome. That's the only reason I'm giving them a 2 star instead of a 1 Star"

We had a blast and it started from the transportation driver who did an amazing job making sure we got to each point safely. The Wino representatives Richard and David customer service was impeccable and have an A in my book. This is the way to decompress and just enjoy life to the fullest especially during these trying times. You will not be disappointed and we are looking forward to more tours with them."

                "description": "Wr had a fabulous time! Full day of entertainment. I was concerned that it might be too strenuous but you had the freedom to walk as much as you wanted or simply hang out in some really beautiful vineyards. The wine offered was really diverse and I would definitely visit each winery on its own. Coby was a great guide, he kept everyone on an even keel, even as the winner flowed. He was fun and engaging during trips aaaaand catered to a wide variety of tastes. Bella was also awesome as a driver, I felt safe the whole time. Would definitely recommend! Would also recommend getting the groupon deal to save a bit of money so you can pick up a few bottles on the way. Being a little more water than you think you'll need, and dress comfortably. Great time!"

                "description": "We booked a wine tour to Fredericksburg and Luckenbach for my birthday. And I'm SO glad we did.   The tour felt very family-run - our guide Jordan (who is a hoot) and our driver David were so genuinely friendly and we felt like we got to know them as friends, not just workers.  It's about an hour shuttle ride and Jordan made sure we were entertained with some funny videos, good music, and some jokes.  We had the perfect amount of guidance at each winery and some autonomy so we could wander or relax without feeling like we were on a tour the entire time. It is a full day after all. Jordan was always around to chat or answer questions. You spend about an hour or more at each stop and it was the perfect amount of time.   At the last stop, Jordan made sure to get me a birthday sangria shot from Fat Ass winery which was delicious. I really felt like we celebrated my birthday without being obnoxious/taking over the entire tour.   The busses are really comfortable. On the way back, we played a trivia game and the winner won a bottle of wine!"

                "description": "So I have mixed feeling about our experience. First off it felt like some wineries were not prepared and decided to take us on last minute especially Mendelbaum and the second one in town. Mendelbaum were so rude. I would have rather done 2 wineries and spent an hour downtown enjoying the shops. Tour guide was fun I don't know how much control he had over the day but he tried. The last winery was the best one with friendly staff that were so cool laughing and joking with us. I think they were called Tejas winery. Overall the bus ride was so fun bc we had fun people on there ! Everyone was ready for a small escape and we enjoyed each others company!"

                "description": "I first have to start out by saying that we had a really great time on our winery tour. We ended up meeting a great group of people and we all made it fun.   We purchased vouchers through Groupon to redeem through the Winos website. Groupon does not state anywhere that there is an additional fee of $31 per person for the wine tastings - so be aware of that when you book. We booked a winery tour with a private 3 course brunch at a winery with a surprise bonus stop.   Starting our tour, our first visit was to a brewery. We purchased the winery tour so we figured maybe this was our surprise bonus stop. We ended up having lunch here with only sandwich and chips options or a salad option. This was not the brunch we intended on.   Our 3 winery visits were great. Fat Ass was definitely our favorite as to how lively and fun loving the owner was for our group! Texas Hills was great as well because the owner gave great explanations and stories behind his wines and winery. 290 Vinery was less interactive but had great wine options.   Phillip tried to be a good host. He talked himself in circles, could not command the group's attention ever and maybe drank a little too much while on the job.  We will consider other companies before booking another wine tour with this company."

                "description": "I'm a bit conflicted about the experience. First of all, our guide Taylor was amazing!! He was entertaining and definitely laid down some ground rules that made everyone on the bus feel welcome, comfortable and most importantly, ready to have fun! He set a great tone for the rest of the trip.  The tour itself was just ok. It felt like we wasted a lot of time just getting to the 1st winery, Messina Hof, which was also the best winery of the 3 in terms of service, ambiance and wine quality! We wasted about 10-15 min waiting for someone, got a bit lost in a parking lot for a while trying to pick up the second group, then hit some traffic, etc. The 2nd winery was a bit strange as we were ushered into a dance hall serving Italian food. The wines were not great (food was decent) but we also received such small pours that it was hard to tell. Definitely felt like a tourist trap. The last winery was an Israeli winery. They definitely didn't seem prepared for large groups and the people working there weren't very pleasant or friendly, mostly overwhelmed. It wasn't a fun experience. Given the long lines, you almost had to get a tasting and get back in line while drinking.   Some suggestions 1. The same tours from Austin were also visiting the same wineries. Are there really not more than 3 wineries in the area so you could spread out some of the crowd? Places like the Israeli winery definitely weren't prepared or staffed appropriately. 2. Better winery selection. I would almost rather have stayed and just hung out at Messina Hof with a bottle and a boxed lunch than visit the other 2 wineries.  3. I felt like we had time to fit in a 4th winery but we ended up leaving pretty early and headed back.  4. With a Groupon deal, we ended up paying $75-80 per person. It's nice to not have to worry about drinking and driving but I definitely expected higher qualities wineries."

The parking situation can be a little anxiety-inducing... but I like to park around the park (take a right at the light before the store) and walk over.  This is such a little gem! They carry a LOT of different types and flavors of olive oil, cheese, wine, and spreads! I come over here and seem to find things I hadn't noticed before, all the time.   I love experimenting with different types of cooking, so having a gourmet store like this near me is really convenient.   The people who work here are also very helpful. I'm not very educated in the ways of wine and cheese (something to strive for?), and they were able to help me find a bottle (or two... don't judge!) and cheese to pair with it.   There's more! They DO have an educated wine professional come in and give tastings, EVERY Saturday! I went to one of these events, and it was a lot of fun!! The store was filled with local people, and some from around the hill country. Because of the small family feeling of the store, everyone was happy and socializing together... which can be a hard thing to accomplish these days   Lastly, (I swear!) I love that this store carries local goods. The honey alone is enough to get me in and spending money.   Check it out sometime!"

I was unenthusiastically greeted by a girl who acted as if I was bothering her by coming into get coffee. I was asking her questions about the place and what they had and she was incredibly rude and continue to answer my questions with one word answers. No smile ever came across her face and she really made me feel uncomfortable as I was just trying to get some information about the store. My family is really big on cigars /coffee/ whiskey and I was very disappointed in the customer service or lack of customer service. I decided to push through and continue with ordering a coffee and when I asked her for a dry cappuccino she proceeded to roll her eyes and told me she didn't know how to make it and asked me what a dry cappuccino was. When I asked her \"isn't this a coffee place?\" she said \"I don't know how to make the coffee I just push the buttons\". As somebody that has been a barista and worked at a coffee shop I tried to explain to her how to make it and she just increasingly became annoyed with me. I decided to scratch the dry cappuccino just ordered a double shot of espresso which was awful by the way. As I continued to try to make small talk it was very apparent that I was not welcome there. I even asked her if she wasn't having a good day because of the way I was being treated. As I was paying, I asked her if there was a place that I could leave a review for the store she looked me dead in my eyes and said no. I confusingly asked her, \" oh you don't have a Yelp?\" She straight up told me no. As somebody that has worked in customer service I have got to say this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and I would never treat a customer the way that I was treated. I just hope that the owners can see this and know what goes on in their store when they're not there because if I was the owner of the store I would want to know about one of my employees making people feel very uncomfortable And not being helpful at all. I made several attempts to try to turn this experience around and give her the opportunity to create a pleasant experience for me but she just acted like I was interrupting her day of sitting on the stool behind the counter. Customer service was awful coffee was awful she didn't even know how to make a dry cappuccino. If I were you I would steer clear of this place it's not worth it."

This place super surprised me, it is decked out with liquor from top to bottom, pretty much anything you could ask for. And if they don't have it, they'll get it, just for you. I was looking for a bottle of a special Asian wine, this location didn't have it but another did... and the owner, Paras, delivered it himself within an hour to the store. Owner, Paras, great person, super knowledgable, and way cool. It was Friday night and he had about 6-8 bottles out for samples and gave recommendations on best ways to drink and mix. Gotta try this place. And if you want \"high-end\" bottles, Paras is the man to talk to."

My big issues included that when I reached out for more information via email I got no response. Also, they offered a pizza meal and it turned out to be Dominos. No offense to them but I was expecting a sit down inside with something more local. Not even paper plates and napkins.   If you are expecting a tour of a winery,  this not that kind of trip. It is a tour of wine places."

                "description": "So the bus was clean, wifi equipped (though weak), and outlets on the back of each seat to stay charged. Weirdly had no music playing for the majority of the trip, guide blamed it as being unfamiliar with SA radio stations since she had just driven in from Houston.   The tours are supposed to consist of three brewery/winery/distillery visits, I'd assumed it would be all of the same category i.e. all brewery or all winery but we had a two for one perk visiting Ranger Creek Brewing and Distillery in that we were getting to try their beers and whiskeys. We'd anticipated a bit of a story and a tour of the facility but honestly this one went on waY too long. Still, this visit was the high point once we realized we weren't limited in our samples and they were pouring full pints.   Back on the bus to New Braunfels Brewing Co., a brewery known for its sour beers, many made with fruity elements and one spiced pickle beer. These were honestly a trip, we were presented two drink tickets and I sampled a pink beer, sour, and a splash of the pickle beer, spicy and sour. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it, one of the homies running the establishment sounded like Seth Rogen so that was a treat. The majority of the bus seemed to really dislike the visit though and I saw a few people tossing beers into sinks or nearby plants.   Our last stop was the Grapevine, something I was super looking forward to but wound up being the most disappointed.  I was anticipating a couple sweet glasses of wine to wind up the trip but after fighting downtown traffic down a narrow road, we were told we'd get 45 minutes to wander around since that's how long our host figured it'd take the bus to circle back. It was so disorganized, we literally just walked in to what felt like a super crowded gift shop where five or six people poured samples down a long bar. The wine samples offered, while delicious, were barely enough for a SIP. I asked our guide if we were supposed to tell them something to get actual glasses of wine and she told us we had to purchase the drinks, only the samples were free and only three samples at that. Okay, so what was all the money we spent on the tickets actually going towards? We got our tickets at a convention where they were offering a special price, 2 for $100 I think,  then the day of the tour we were told to bring $20 cash for a tasting fee. What the what?  Even after alllllll that, during the drive back to the drop-off point, our guide announces both she and the bus driver work for tips. $70+ at the end of the day and barely caught a buzz."

                "description": "I booked the San Antonio beer bus as a last-minute activity with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The owner, Neil, took my reservation over the phone and was awesome about squeezing us in.    We had a blast! We went to three different places - Ranger Creek brewery/distillery, Weathered souls brewery, and Artisan on Alamo (vodka distillery).    Ranger Creek - hands down our favorite.  The guys working there were amazing, they really went above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and made sure everyone had a good time.  We got three full pint pours plus multiple samples of bourbon.  Lots of variety in the beer options.  We opted to purchase a bottle of bourbon and some bourbon filled chocolates to take home with us.  The brewery seemed to only be open for tours at the time and were able to focus their entire attention on our tour group.  The next top, Weathered souls brewery was very busy.  They were hosting a party at the time, and about 3/4 of the seating area was reserved for the party, forcing our tour group to the patio.  At this brewery, we received two tokens good for a half-pour of 4 pre-selected beers they had on tap.  I chose the only one that wasn't an IPA (IPA isn't my thing), and it tasted like a very strong IPA.  My husband was sweet enough to purchase me one of the non-tour options that the staff insisted was not an IPA, but it tasted identical to what was already in my glass.  Not a lot of variety in the options here, and the options for purchase were very overpriced (growlers, etc).    Artisan on Alamo was our least favorite stop.  The owner came off as rude and bothered when asked questions.  Our guide boasted about mixed drinks, but we discovered when we got there that mixed drinks were only available to purchase, not as part of our samples included in the tour.  They did, however, have a big selection of cocktails available for a  reduced \"tour price\" of $5.  The vodka samples we received were small, and the whole place was a little underwhelming.    Overall, we loved the whole beer bus experience.  Our beer bus guide (who I cannot remember his name, oops) was also amazing.  Snacks and bottled water were offered between stops, and the bus played classic rock on the radio which produced many drunken sing-a-longs.  When we arrived back at our starting point at the Lion and Rose pub, we received a voucher for a free appetizer.  We decided to eat there after checking the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed.  The food was amazing, the staff was excellent and had our appetizer in our hungry hands within minutes.    Tips:  -Get either an Uber or a Lyft to and from your meeting point. -Bring a bag for your swag! We got a pint glass from each of the places we visited, so we left with 6 total, plus items we purchased. -Eat something before you board the bus - our tour started at 11:30 and ended around 4:30.  Even with the snacks, we were starving by the time we got back to the pub -Wear sunscreen! Two of the three places we went had a patio with limited shade, I was very grateful that I lathered up in sunscreen before we left.    We definitely will be doing a beer bus again!  Would love to do an Austin tour or Dallas if ya'll come up north!"

                "description": "We got tickets to the Texas Beer Bus not knowing exactly what was involved. All we knew was that we got the tickets for $50, and we were promised a day of breweries. We showed up at the appointed spot, the parking lot of The Lion and the Rose. They didn't have any water waiting for us, and had us stand around in the heat of the parking lot while we waited for a MegaBus that was about 20 minutes late. While we stood around waiting for the late bus, we were told that if we actually wanted to drink beer on this Beer Bus tour, we'd have to chip in another $20. I felt ripped off. Why not include that in the fee? When we finally got going, there was no beer on the bus. They said that was illegal (it's not.)  We drove around in circles for about 20 minutes trying to find the first brewery. They didn't know where it was. Apparently, they hadn't been there before.  When we finally arrived, Ranger Creek did a great job of explaining the beer, the whiskey, and the brewing process.  Blue Star didn't seem to be expecting us. They hurriedly poured us a few ounces of beer while we stood around waiting for something. I don't know what. Nobody told us about the place, and we got rushed out of there almost as soon as we got there.  The third brewery cut my brother off for being loud and obnoxious. I don't blame them.  In all, we went to three breweries. Ranger Creek, Blue Star, and Freetail.  I felt ripped off that the beer tasting charge wasn't explained until we were already $50 into it. Plus, they made us fill out these liability waiver forms after they had our money. Don't like the terms of the form? No refunds. What a ripoff. Who's going to take a beer tour and not drink beer?  The tour was poorly planned, terribly executed, and felt like a rip off. Our guide didn't know the first thing about the breweries (didn't even know where they were).   I'm never taking this tour again, and I discourage you from doing it too. There's other brewery tours in town. Better yet, just go on your own."

(They helpfully suggested that we take a $25 Uber ride to get up to their bus. Yeah, thanks.)   Beer tasting is not included in this beer tour! (It's an extra $20 to actually drink beer, paid day of.)   The breweries on the itinerary were Oskar Blues and Austin Beerworks. Both are walking distance from the meeting point.   I am genuinely confused why anyone would pay $125+ pp for this."

We enjoy the atmosphere and the easy way we are able to tour the breweries, wineries and distilleries in Texas. We have been to North Houston, Dallas and Austin. Our fourth tour will hopefully be in south Houston. We are able to uber to our meeting site and they provide unlimited chips and water on the bus. We eat a good breakfast before we go and they provide pizza at the second or third stop.  There have been food trucks at each stop to purchase food to absorb the alcohol!

                "description": "Don't do it!! Let me lay it out there for you.  I've been on other beer bus tours in other cities so was super excited when my sister in law bought us all tickets last christmas. I don't mean to sound rude but our host needs a new occupation, her monotone voice portrayed the excitement of a funeral or a 0-0 exhibition soccer game. The music on the bus didn't work for over half the ride and it reeked of exhaust the first half of the trip.  The stops were cool but they're independent of the tour co so that makes sense. For the last third of the trip,  we took a 45 min ride through traffic back into town for our host to notify us,  after multiple updates and delays that our third stop wasn't possible. During all this,  we pass a bad wreck which the hosts comments on the intercom and tells us how many people die in car accidents every year. Honestly I cannot convey the level of frustration or dissatisfaction I have with our purchase and this company. #fail"

The original bus driver no-showed, when the bus finally showed it was almost two hours late. The first stop was 23 MILES away near Austin Bergstrom-Hi Sign Brewery-decent beer, but nothing special. The second stop was another 17 MILES east To Cedar Creek to a START-UP \"whiskey\" distillery-Armadillo Whiskey Distillery-the whiskey is only \"whiskey\" thanks to a loophole in Texas liquor laws, its moonshine and it's terrible. The owner Matthew Wells spent so much time on the tour that he delayed the bus getting to our third stop. At the third stop-Adelbert's Brewery-we had less than 40 minutes to consume four beers."

                "description": "I started the process of booking a private event through TBB 4 months before the date. We had a great experience with them on a public tour the prior year so figured it would be great for a birthday event. Unfortunately, this was not the case for the private tour. It was $99/person (which does not include tax OR a payment fee) which includes a bus that takes you to 3 different locations (these will not be confirmed until the week prior...) from 12-5, pizza lunch, and a voucher for every attendee to get a free visit at a later date. When making the payments- which can only be made by 1 person, they continued to keep forgetting to include my original deposit towards the payment.. and when I asked if I could pay in person (cash or check) to avoid the payment fee they simply said no. So all in all, I ended up paying close to $200 in JUST this fee alone.  The day of the event, we arrived at our first location and they had no idea that we were coming. So our group of 38 waited for near 10 minutes before knowing what we were doing. Not off to the best start. At our last event, the tour guide told me it was time to leave at 4 pm... which was 1 hour before the agreed end time. After convincing him to try and call his contact from TBB, he finally said we could stay until 4:40.  They never had any of the vouchers to give the guests. The following week I called to speak to someone about my experience. The woman basically said it was the brewery and the guide's fault and took absolutely no responsibility. She ended the conversation with \"we will try harder next time\". She agreed to send emails to each of my guests with the voucher by the end of the week. Well, that week came and when I contacted them they said it was too difficult and asked me do it instead which involved gathering 38 of my guest's emails and emailing each person an individual voucher (they emailed me the 38 different attachments......) In exchange for my trouble they sent me a few extra vouchers. I responded telling them how ridiculous this was for me to spend my time having to do all this. No response.  Long story short, for each person to pay $99 and all the different fees that I had to pay - they were incredibly unorganized, poor customer service, and just flat out not worth it. Definitely NOT recommending them to anyone. I felt like I had to spend WAY too much time trying to help organize and figure out the details of the event which in my opinion, is not my responsibility. There are plenty of other tours out there who will provide a smoother and more enjoyable time."

We saw a tent for this company at a festival so we purchased four tickets because we thought this would be a fun thing to do for a bachelor party. We were not told it was a public tour or that we had to register online so we thought we had seats on our private tour. We were told we could have the other groomsmen call and pay for a ticket at a later date once we got all the info for the tour which we were supposed to get the next day. After one week of no response to my email, I called two different numbers, both of which had a voicemail that said email, do not leave a voicemail. I've never heard of a company not having a phone you can call and talk to a human being. I sent an email and got no reply. So I tried again two days later, I sent two and after the second one, I got a phone call. I was told at that time, almost two weeks after I was supposed to get the details, that it was a public tour, now there are not enough seats for everyone who wants to go, we had to register online, the ticket is just a reminder you paid for a tour. I explained that we were not told any of that when we purchased the tickets, the woman told me it's all on the receipt, which, we also weren't told when we purchased the tickets on a Square card reader and the receipt gets sent to junk mail, we knew what the cost was so why read the receipt? The woman on the phone agreed to give me a refund for the trouble and not being clear about logistics and having such a hard time dealing with the company. I sent her the receipt, no response. I emailed two more times, I finally got \"it will be processed.\" Nearly two weeks and 7 emails later, still no refund. DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY WITH THIS \"COMPANY\". You are made to feel like a nuisance once you've paid for the service they are supposed to provide. They have your money, why should they deal with you now?? I do hair and the biggest part of providing a great experience for my clients is customer service. If I ran my business the way these people do, I would have no business! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED! DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!"

I've been to a couple of wineries but never a tour. You never know how things will go, but this was a great trip. Alicia was very knowledgable and got us to a great variety of wineries. I learned a lot and had some great wine. She even got me the cheese I had been craving all day. Wine can do that to a brother, you know.  I'm looking forward to another tour next year."

                "description": "My friends and I bought the ARC Hill Country Wine Tour from Living Social for about $30. Trying to schedule the tour was really confusing, because the system they have on their main website is not the same system/website that you book with if you have a Living Social deal (it was a bookeo.com site). My first recommendation is to include, somewhere on your website, a link to your bookeo.com site for people who have Living Social/Groupon deals. I also submitted multiple emails from the website's \"contact us\" page without any response. When I did call Alicia to check if she received my emails, she claimed that she had not, but she had yet to even ask me my name....Weird. Anyway, this could have gone alot smoother.   The actual tour was okay. My friend read reviews about Alicia showing up late, and she did. We were all on the bus for the most part and she showed up maybe 4-5 minutes late. I completely agree that she, as the business owner and tour guide, should be the first person there with the driver. Second recommendation - show up early and take care of checking people in as they arrive, not 10-15 minutes after the tour was supposed to start.   Alicia talked to us the entire way telling us the history of wine making in the Texas Hill Country, and that was really nice. We were sitting in the very back, so it was hard to hear her. I would get a small microphone to help with that, because the stuff she was saying was very informative. We went to 3 different wineries. All were excellent, and we learned alot. My favorite was Singing Water.   After the 2nd winery, Alicia put on this wine tasting dvd while we were on the bus, which was basically a \"Master of Wine\" talking about how much she knows about wine. It was insanely comical. We were all thinking \"omg is this chic serious?\" I do like that Alicia tried to give us a break from hearing her talk, and she probably needed it to, but there HAS to be some better material to show us. Please, get another dvd that is not so obnoxious. I did a quick youtube search on \"Wine 101\" and a handful of much better options popped up.   All in all, we had a fun time. I feel bad for giving only two stars, but the truth is, there is alot of room for improvement. Had I paid the full $100+ dollars for this wine tour I would be outraged. It was fine for $30 bucks though."

                "description": "I realized this would not be a professionally run operation when we got on the bus. The tour guide stood up, gave us all a big smile, and immediately said, \"I'm not going to talk much to y'all this time because I'm tired and I don't feel like it.\"   It all went downhill from there. She then told us she was not a wine expert and explained her business at length, asking us to please tip her and telling us about her money issues. Despite her first statement, she never once paused for breath the entire ride to Fredericksburg, alternatively talking about her personal taste in wine, sharing a random, vague tidbits of information about wine and Texas, and telling us more about her personal thoughts about wine and how she treated her friends who didn't appreciate it  properly. She occasionally asked questions about the groups' tastes in wine and was condescending to those who answered 'wrong.'  My seatmate and I were looking out the window during the bus ride and we occasionally whispered to each about the sites we saw on the way there since this was our first trip out to Fredericksburg. The tour guide heard our whispering and chided us like naughty schoolgirls. She then told us about another customer who asked her to stop talking so much and how she told him off as well. We were astonished.   I look younger than my age, which occasionally gets me treated in a very condescending manner, and this was one of these occasions. I was the only one she carded, which I could understand, but then she made non-stop cracks about my relative youth and taste in wine. She asked who liked sweet wines, and since I was one of the ones who raised my hand, she repeatedly told me I would someday \"grow into my big girl pants,\" assuming I was completely ignorant of good wine, that familiar creature, due to my youthful appearance.  She was also rude and/or condescending to the rest of my party and some of our fellow wine tourists. I could see why she found it necessary to repeatedly remind all of us about tipping her.   Lunch was very small and disappointing: a small turkey sandwich on dry bread, a small bag of chips, and a cookie.    The wine tastings themselves were fabulous! We really, really enjoyed the wineries when the tour guide left us to ourselves and we were allowed to chat and taste. To quote Jefferson, \"Wine brightens the life and thinking of anyone!\" We also appreciated the bathroom breaks the bus made there and back. Though we will avoid ARC like the plague, we intend to attempt a proper wine tour in that area. There are many other similarly priced wine tour options in the area that I recommend trying before this company. For a few dollars more, you can actually do three wineries in a limo with Fredericksburg Wine and Limo. Fredericksburg is lovely and the wines are fabulous!"

She didn't talk about tipping or making fun at others offensively at all. We went to 3 wineries in Federickberg. A lot of relaxing time. Lunch was satisfying. It was chicken salad sandwich with chip and cookies. The wine testing was great. I read the reviews in the past and I think Alicia has listened to all the critics and has improved the services. The only reason I gave 4 stars because before the tour took off, Alicia was late 7 min. while about 25 customers was waiting on the bus. The guide should be the first one there.  Anyway, take the tour...it was fun and nice scenery."

                "description": "They have it all and then some. The place is so well organized and it's huge,the staff know their stuff and are professional. They have huge selection of wine and they have all kinds of Bourbon,Rye,Tequila,Gin,Whiskey and much more from low prices to very expensive like I saw a bottle of Tequila behind a glass cabinet for like $2500!  I went there recently to buy Luxardo Cherries for my Old Fashions and I found that they have Humidor with nice selection of premium cigars so it eliminates two stops in case I am in the mood for a nice cigar with my old fashion I don't have to stop at Cigar shop and traffic in this area can get little crazy so less stops the more better. I am not a frequent shopper here but I might stop by more cause they have a nice Humidor now and I think their prices are little cheaper than most places or competitive. Like to mention that all ready Jell-O shots,Buttery Nipple shots and few more I can't remember the name but have some funny names like for example Twisted Shots and Miami Vice Shots in a 15 count package which come in different flavors and  Wine and More has all your party accessories for your New Years Eve Party!! I am coming back for some party shots!! Oh I just found a bottle Cognac for $3999. Look up there Web Site you can type in whatever your looking for and it will show a pic and description but I recommend you go there instead oh and they have on line pickup too. I have no pics for this review but if you go there you won't be disappointed."

                "description": "I celebrated my military retirement here earlier this week, and wish to extend my appreciation to Dennis and the rest of the team and R.C. for their hospitality during the event.  We started with a tour of their brewing and distilling facility, which is very unassuming to people who are simply walking or driving by the building. The tour was just the right amount of time, and offered us a good look into how their production works. And then, samples! We tried three or four of the whiskies being sold regularly, and got a look at their upcoming seasonal/promotional products. Kudos to our tour guide!  The food was catered, with R.C. taking care of everything, from setup to cleanup.  The products these guys have available are all very good, so make a stop out the next time you're driving south on IH-35."

Dennis - Helped me set everything up, was super helpful and tolerated my constant check-ins to make sure everything was going well.   The samples - All came on time, despite the freak weather in Texas. And the presentation of said samples was very impressive. Not just a few samples thrown in a cardboard box, but individually labeled bottles in a branded  wooden box with a tasting card, lovingly packaged to ensure no wasted whiskey.  Mike - Our host, was friendly, knowledgeable, and pretty dang funny. He was great at involving everyone in the tasting convo, even those who opted out of having whiskey.   Overall, great virtual tasting that I will 100% be doing again even outside of the covid times. 10/10 would recommend."

I have toured the facility a couple of times before because they do a great job and I like supporting local businesses.  I do wish Col. Mc had been there, but hopefully he will come back to lead tours again soon : ) The price is very affordable and you can even hang out at the bar and food truck with your new found friends from the tour."

                "description": "Bottom Line: One of the better breweries I've been to around the US. First time at a distillery and definitely first brew-stillery I've been to. Very impressive and delicious assortment of beers and a great variety of spirits makes Ranger Creek one of my favorite places in Texas for sure. The $10 tour is the absolute best I've ever been to, learning about beer making and whiskey distilling! The Even bought a souvenir glass!  This place is an experience for their tour. You MUST do it! But you should sign up at least 3-4 days in advance if not a week ahead because the spots do sell out. For $10, you will get TWO beer tickets which you can drink during the tour. Then at the distilling part of the tour, we were given 3 .5 ounce tastings of three different whiskeys. That alone is like a $8 value on top of two beers. And when it says 45 minute tour, it's more like 1:30-2 hours long because Big Mike, our tour guide, is so damn passionate about what they do there. Expect to stay longer...you'll want to.   The beers on top are excellent. Lots of variety. Not the best spot if you're an IPA fan but they have lots of other options. My favorite was their Belgian White Ale and their Hefeveizen. They also have super cheap 6 packs to go, ranging from $5-8 or so. Totally worth it! You can do beer and whiskey flight tastings so you'll have to chance to try it all!   Amazing brewery and distillery. Totally recommend. Especially on nice sunny day where you can sit outside."

Purchased 3 bottle of their bourbon and a flight, but just don't personally care for the rye and she threw such a fit when I asked if I could substitute it for anything else. Really a turn off when she then presented me with the bill expecting at least an 18% tip when she crammed 2 of the bottles into one bag even after I said they where gifts. Geez I really should have used the curbside. That guy at least is friendly. Where is the Colonel? He never treated us this way?"

There was plenty of hand sanitizer and they encouraged social distancing. Everyone was required to wear a mask, as well as the employees.  We did a tour and it came with two free beer tickets. The person leading the tour was funny and was very knowledgeable. Tour lasted for about an hour and we ended up getting a few more drinks in their back space behind the building.    I did feel a little unsafe in the back space, the tables are spread out but I didn't see anyone actively disinfecting the tables in between groups. They were actively serving cocktails, beer, beer flights, whiskey and whiskey flights."

The Michelada was spicy, tangy, and herbed with a smooth finish... would have been better dressed with tajin and chamoy...  The margarita was a very good, made with the chili beer and white whiskey... very tasty, earthy, and sweet with an exotic taste!   They held a raffle and I won a six pack of the hatch"

There's 10 or 12 picnic tables inside and more outside under an awning (in the back). Yes, I scoped it out for y'all - you're welcome.  The line to get beer or whiskey refills isn't bad at all.  There's usually a food truck out front and they also allow you to bring your own food inside, so I'll give them a star for that!"

                "description": "My wife and I were in San Antonio for a long weekend and we had just landed on a Wednesday and they opened at 3. We walked in at 3:01 and they had some food out for the team members, which I thought was pretty cool. They were brewing as well, since I could smell the hops boiling away!  I ordered an IPA, that was great and two pulled pork tacos.  The server behind the counter was super nice and she brought out the tacos. They were pretty large and the pulled pork was especially juicy and the toppings were perfect. These were so good. I tried 6 places for BBQ and this was number 3 by far, plus they make their own beer, score sone for the Gipper. There was true smokiness to the tacos and just delicious.  I got one more beer and I would highly recommend this place."

                "description": "I'm a native Texan that owns a Midwest brewery so I'm researching:  - props to the German pils and Helles - those are hard beers to make because they depend on being really clean and faithful to the fermentation process and they knocked it out of the park.  That may be the best Helles I've ever had - EVER - The Belgian quad was many things but a Belgian style quad it was not - grant it, the only Belgian style quads I've had were in Belgium - stouts we're hyper sweet, but that may be a market thing, but Irish or English stouts they were not. - IPAs - they were fine but everyone is doing IPAs - so if you are into IPAs - their triple is the jam!!!  - Tacos came in a bit cold the brisket was great but the pulled pork left a lot to be desired ...  Had I come in for brisket tacos (and had they been served hot), and a full pour of Helles, this place would have received a 6 out of five!"

                "description": "Very disappointing. First visit. Brought my boss for lunch, and had high hopes. Ordered burgers to go and had a mango slush (very tasty!) while waiting. Rather slow, even with a largely empty dining roomSadly, upon return to the office, we discovered both our burgers were burnt to a crisp. I'll give Weathered Souls another chance, but won't bring a guest until I'm confident the food will be acceptable. [UPDATE] Note 1:  The kitchen is operated by South BBQ and Kitchen, not Weathered Souls Brewery.  Note 2: Weathered Souls owner, Mike Holt, very graciously reached out to make accommodation for today's unfortunate occurrence. None is required, and I look forward to a better experience at a future visit."

Rise and Shine was the beer I had from this brewery and I was very impressed by it! This beer had a nice roasty,  coffee flavor to it which was amazing! Once again another brewery where I am eager to explore their other beer options. If they are as awe inspiring as Rise and Grind I will become a very, very avid fan. Not that I'm not heading in that direction right now."

Several QUALITY beers to chose from depending on your taste and good food too.   Get a flight of beers to start off. The wait staff knows their stuff and can help guide selections.   Once you have had a sampling, hone in on one try enjoy and get your food order in. You'll be enjoying a top-notch beer and tasty food in no time!   No complaints here. Everyone we talked to was cool and very helpful with beer selections. We'll be back for sure!  Check them out and then hit me up on Instagram @CheadDay_SA and let me know what you thought!"

It was a Saturday evening and my party was waiting for another restaurant. Like I mentioned earlier, I didn't know this brewstillery served food and drink. So we decided to go for a couple of drinks before dinner. My wife and our two friends got the hard seltzer's and I went for the ginger bread stout. My wife's seltzer was really fruity and bubbly (I'm going to buy a case at a wine store later). I couldn't really taste the gingerbread in my stout, but it wasn't super hoppy, it was sweet, and it went down pretty smooth. I need to come back sometime soon to taste their bar food and try some other of their offerings."

The ambience is relaxed, with a simplistic decor giving you the feeling to come as you are.   They have many different styles to choose from, and I personally recommend the fan favorites Material Girl, West Coast IPA, and Dale Shine!   They also serve food, complimentary of South BBQ, the Sweet Heat Brussels are beyond delish, lightly fried with a sweet and spicy peanut sauce.   They do not serve food on Mondays, but have a food truck on site!"

Check it out at https://blackisbeautiful.beer/  I had the pleasure of visiting the brewery back in December killing time before my flight! All the beers I tried were delicious! If you are a fan of dark beers this is the place for you! They offer a great variety of dark beers! Be sure to check out the menu because they have lighter beers also. It's not a very large brewery but a decent size and they have a few games you can play if your with a group! Definitely check out this brewery if you are in the area!  Also, be sure to check the COVID restrictions because I am not sure how they are handling that currently since I visited last year."

As we walk in you notice the place is very clean, has a nice dÃ©cor and a relaxed vibe. As we walk up to the counter to order we are greeted by one of the servers who goes over the draft menu with us, provides a few samples then takes our order: one Prestidigitator Doppelbock and one Habitual Line Stepper Imperial Stout. I start of trying the Habitual Line Stepper and found it not too heavy with notes of coffee towards the end. It was smooth and had an overall pleasant taste. Next, I tried the Prestidigitator Doppelbock and really liked it. It had a light taste for a dark beer with strong hints of malt which I prefer over hops (not an IPA guy).  Overall, considering I only tried two of their offerings I'm be happy to come back and try the rest sometime soon. If you're in the neighborhood be sure to come by and try this local gem. Cheers!"

We went on a week day evening for dinner and drinks. The location is really nice! I love the ascetics. When we walked in the place was a little on the dead side, so it was odd that we weren't greeted by the bartender. It was our first time, so we had no idea how or where to order and there were no signs displayed. I know this is a brewery, so I didn't expect they would have servers. We eventually had to wave down the bartender so we could place our order. I ordered a very delicious and flavorful cider! YUMMY! For dinner I ordered chips and brisket queso and two brisket taco! All of it was a hit! I really hope they bring back side though. I notice that fellow yelpers have pictures with sides, so I was a little disappointed when those were not available. I would definitely recommend this place for a hearty snack and a solid adult beverage. Just remember, no sides at the moment so order accordingly."

We'll definitely be giving them another chance the next time we're in the area."

It is probably one of- if not my favorite- brewery in San Antonio.   I was introduced to this place by a friend, and my friends and I have been back many times ever since. With COVID aside, they have really cool events are have a great vibe. They have a small outdoor section and indoor area. Their quality/variety of beer, the incredible service, and just the wonderful family feel really makes this place great. They are constantly coming out with incredible flavors with my favorite being a Vietnamese French Press they had some time ago. They also do flights, which makes it fun to try different flavors. They recently reopened, and it is a place you should definitely check out.  Also something notable about this brewery is they dropped a beer called Black is Beautiful. This beer is to support the injustice a lot of African Americans have faced and to raise funds to combat police brutality. You can learn about it more here: https://blackisbeautiful.beer/. This beer is also incredible. This is just further evidence to show you the quality of people behind Weathered Souls.   Could not recommend this brewery anymore!"

What I really like about this place is their Brisket and BBQ Sauce. Some of the best I've had in San Antonio so far, definitely way better than Bill Millers BBQ that I see littered everywhere in San Antonio. The BBQ Sauce they have is unique I've never had anything like it until I ate brisket here.   While they're primarily a Bar if they had more BBQ options I'm sure they'd do great."

I had their double west coast IPA and it was nice but nothing to write home about.  Now on to the service, our bartender was stingy and rude. He gave us half his attention and only allowed one sample per person, which based on  the prices you would think they included at least a dozen samples per beer. Our bartender gave us our beers and left and refused to check on us again for the 45 minutes we were there. We finally had to get the attention of someone else to check us out. I will say that she was much friendlier and even gave us a very generous sample of a beer we wanted to try that the other bartender refused to give us.   All in all if you are looking for pretty good overpriced  beer with not great service is might be worth a stop"

Pulled pork, coleslaw and a yummy sauce. I recommend it highly. The rest of the group also loved their food - hamburger, brisket sandwich, brisket taco and hummus with veggies. The guys loved the Breakfast in Zambia imperial stout and my daughter- in-law loved the Brown Bag Lunches beer which was a sour. There was a peanut butter after taste that everyone really liked.  (Of course, we all had to taste it!). You can sit in or out and the folks running it are very nice. Good place to hang out!"

                "description": "Gene Simmons of Kiss said of his father who was a salesman at the end of the day it is ultimately you who sells something. I wish businesses were more attuned to this. At the end of the day it is a place's owners and staff that makes us go back or keeps us away. I came to \"Man Overboard Brewing Co.\" for a soft opening. It is nearby an underpass that opens up with more parking. When I arrived staff were already outside greeting you. Although this doesn't cost a business a penny it is priceless.  The brewery is really, really small but big on charm. Inside there are picnic style benches for seating. There is finite seating for large and small groups. Once inside the owner greeted me and simply said, \"Welcome, thank you for coming here!\" As I have said before when a place is not bumping this is the most optimal time to make a connection to a patron. The tapmasters, who happened to be owners were absolutely friendly which transferred to all the their products. Basically you go to the counter and order. They serve beer, wine, seltzers and ciders. It is a very limited taplist right now but the owner assured me they are adding more items next week.   Soft openings are meant as an opportunity for a business to see what needs to tweaked. Lucky for me the place was functioning like a well-oiled machine. My only critique from me is for them to consider adding outdoor seating. Other than that I like that it is small but intimate. My understanding is that they are former veterans who decided to open a brewery. I can sense those experiences have lead them to this moment. They offered a flight so I went with that. I had their blonde, their coffee porter, tangerine wit and ipa. They all had really good flavors. I will say the ipa seemed more boozier than its 6.5% abv. As I was leaving I definitely felt like a man in fact overboard.    To me as I travel from both regional and local breweries it's not the beers that sell a place but rather the people. Product can and should develop over time but the staff is really who sells any business. Consistency in beers is one thing but consistency in service supersedes even that. At that capacity Man Overboard Brewing Co. will be here for awhile. The place and ambiance are charming. The beers are solid but the service is stellar.  If you happen to be in this area check it out.   ps. If your GPS is not working don't worry! Just look for the two dudes with the epic viking beards and you're good!"

(Amazing BBQ)  My wife and I saddled up to the bar and I ordered an IPA. Delish. The most fun was talking to the couple next to us. We spent about 30 minutes introducing ourselves and talking about travel and the like.  The bartender was super nice and it was a great stop after an amazing BBQ meal.  I don't know how my wife finds all these cool places, but she does, and it is wonderful!"

Positives up front: The service was excellent and zero wait time on seating.    The negative? The huge disappointment in their craft beer selection.  Mostly all of their featured beer were not on the current menu.  I had a flight of four and left with slight headache (I've been hydrating all day).   The food menu varies from day to day, and today's selection was just not for me.  If I would've known this ahead of time I would've selected a different day to try this place out.    Their appetizers were good though, we had their Pretzel charcuterie board and loved it.  I was a little surprised when I heard there was an up-charge to get fries with the meal, as apparently the standard offering  are patati chips.    Would I return? No. Would I recommend it to family and friends? No. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it for themselves though."

This place is a lot bigger than expected. But not overly huge. Still a nice intimate setting and laid back as you would expect from a brewery. They have a patio out front and a separate room for games and watching sports. I really enjoyed that they were separated. It kept the room that we were in nice for some conversation and trying out the brews and food. This is a really nice brewery with some delicious takes on German food. I got the Sichuan beer, which was very tasty and unlike any beer I have had before. It also tasted super fresh since they brew it right there. My partner got their sangria which I also tried and it was very good! We opted for the charcuterie pretzel to share with our drinks. The pretzel was warm, soft and really tasty. The cheese that came with this board was amazing! We loved it. No idea what it was or anything but before we knew it the entire plate was gone. Absolutely wondeful experience. Will definitely be back with my growler and try some other items!"

                "description": "My only regret is that I didn't try this place sooner!!! Came here on Labor Day since we had the day off and extra time. I don't even know where to start... the beer is great, I started with a flight to see which one I preferred and then followed up with a couple of pints . We shared the pretzel  which we upgraded to the fancy version of a charcuterie board. The pickles, Brie and cured meats aren't to be missed. The pretzel and mustard are also excellent! I had the bratwurst  with sauerkraut and it checked all the right boxes! The staff was super friendly and would hang out and chat us up when they had time. Danny (I think) gave us a long history of the place and events that were in the works. Since then, we've been back 5 or 6 times with plenty of friends. The beer garden has picnic tables so you can get a nice sized group of people together. The schnitzel (which is only a special on certain nights) is not to be missed! They are also dog friendly!  Love this place!"

I ordered the pretzel charcuterie and it was good as well I recommend it if you are a fan of charcuterie. The pickled stuff that came with it was not as good as I was hoping though. It was a little pricey for the amount of food but the beer was priced very fairly so I would say it evened out for the most part. Definitely a pace I recommend if you're looking for a nice brewery in the area!   Overall: 4.4 stars"

Our server was very friendly and helpful, she even gave us some souvenir stickers after hearing we were first time visitors from out of town.  We ordered the prickly pina, hop train, and an order of pretzel bites with pimento. The hop train was a standard hazy ipa, but the prickly pina really took it up a notch! I loved the little bit of heat that I've never tasted before in an ipa, I would absolutely recommend if you're a fan of this style. As good as the beer was, the pretzel bites and pimento were the stars of the show. These pretzel bites tasted as good as they looked, and the pimento was the best I've ever had. This is the perfect dish to pair with a couple of beers."

Masks are encouraged but not required for fully vaccinated folks (but it's not like they are checking). The brats are awesome, none of that over boiled blandness. My husband got the currywurst and I got the onion brats. Both came on pretzel buns with fries. Everything was fresh. Pretzels looked good, but choices had to be made! The flight is pricey ($45), but it's not only includes the four pours but when you decide what you like, you get a Stein of that one and the Stein is yours to keep. It's not a huge food menu but the service is great and very friendly."

                "description": "So my party of 5 orders brunch--two with the same German pancake order.  4 of the orders are delivered, including one of the German pancakes.  The waitress indignantly delivers it with \"the other one is late because the kitchen got backed up.\"  Seriously?!  How did the kitchen get backed up in the middle of the order?  And how did they deliver one of the two identical orders?  Did they suddenly forget how to make the pancakes halfway through?     This frustration was compounded by parties arriving AFTER our first 4 dishes coming out having their meals arrive BEFORE our 5th meal finally came out.    The restaurant did nothing to remedy this--other than \"sorry, the kitchen was backed up.\"  Seriously?!  Who wants to be eating alone after the rest of your party finished.   Such a poor, poor experience.     The owner needs to work a hek of a lot in ensuring this doesn't happen again and, more importantly, be sure to step in to make a customer's experience right after they screw up.   Will not return, but will sure to persuade folks to find a better place that isn't so mismanaged."

                "description": "Bottom Line: AMAZING BEERS!!! Huge Variety that all taste buds will approve of. From IPAs to stouts/porters and everything in between. However, the food is par and the service wasn't great. Long waits at times for drinks and forgot parts of orders. Highly recommend for just a drinking and snacks occasion!!  Drinks: Huge menu of many different types of beers. They do a 4 beer flight that you can get to try a few kinds. Some of our favorites were: - Blackberry Streusel: A really flavorful, sour type of ale that isn't too sour or too hoppy. It's a house favorite for sure! - Matcha Milkshake IPA: Not something you'd expect but I've had milkshake IPAs in the past. This one was tasty, minimal green tea taste though, but very easy to drink IPA - Wolfie Vienna Lager: Very easy and drinkable beer. Can't go wrong here with the good lager flavor.  - Austin Bier Oyster Stout: Made with oysters, you have no shellfish taste, but you have the salinity of the oyster. Really tasty but prepare for it to be like salted chocolate!  - Confident Bitch: This was some of the favorites of our crew. Didn't try it but people enjoyed it. Gotta order it with confidence!!  Food: Not my favorite food but it was okay to counter the beer.  - Pretzel: Soft and salty, exactly what you want! The mustard was also pretty mild and tasty. There are three cheeses to choose from as well to come with it.  - Shrimp roll: Decent, nothing extravagant. Not bad, but nothing memorable.  - Kraut salad: I thought this would taste good but all it tasted was like red cabbage lightly soaked in vinegar... tasteless and bland. Really recommend to choose any other side dish!!   Final Thoughts: Kunstler brewing has amazing beers. Lots of choices. Will definitely return for a day or night of beers and pretzels, but will happily leave it at that without ordering any of the food. Spend the $12 on two more beers!"

So glad to have found this gem of a brewery nearby!  Came into the place and the pourer behind the counter was nice in answering some questions.  Went with A Man and His Dog Irish Stout.  This was a quality beer.  They had a few games to play at the table, so we played a competitive game of Uno.  On the board, they had a number of Running and Mountain Biking clubs meet up and on Thursday's they have 3 growler fill ups for $30.  Hell of a deal!  I will be back to this place multiple times."

Even better though is the sense of community you feel sipping the suds at Second Pitch. Cozy ambiance that feels like Texas and the TV show cheers had a baby and it grew up to be SPB. Tables set up to capitalize on good weather. Lovely place to hang. Drink local!"

                "description": "Totally loving this brewery! There really isn't a beer they have that not solid - and there's pretty much one for every taste.     Sitting unassumingly in this business park off Starcrest,this small brewery has tons to offer. Service has always been fast and everyone working has been super cool. I'm just going to say it, it's the KÃ¼nstler of the NE side! I don't think I've been this excited about a brewery and their beers since KÃ¼nstler and Islla.  The inside is small but they've converted their parking lot into seating area-all tables socially distanced.  They have various nightly events (including movie night) and I can't wait for BYOV (bring your own vinyl) night!  I ABSOLUTELY love that you can bring your let's, it's a sure +!  As far as food goes, they'll have a rotating list of food trucks so you'll never go hungry.  My favorite beer right now is their Black is Beautiful variant which is made with HEB's Taste of San Antonio coffee. It's a must try before they run out!"

Your allowed to bring in your own snacks and even your dog! If your in the area definitely check this place out! Get a flight so you can try as many beers as possible. They have a great IPA which I loved and my husband liked the honey beer I forget what it was called but when you get there you'll see it on the board. Easy ordering, great menu, cool staff, and there's even a great Greek food truck outside!"

I typically don't think lighter beers are anything to write about, but Second Pitch had a fantastic ale/light beer that is definitely worth trying (I think it was the Summer Lightning Ale). It's one of the better beers I've tried in awhile.  When we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, they had a few picnic tables set up outside and a couple of tables inside. There isn't much shade, and while we were there they didn't have umbrellas over the tables, although they did set one up at the request of someone. I'd bring sunscreen. :)   While they don't serve food, there was a food truck on site. The service was friendly and attentive, at least inside where we were one of two tables. They also have beer to go if you want to take some home!"

It is in an industrial area which gives the place a cool vibe. They have a food truck outside from those that want a tasty morsel, I did not partake in the food this time but will next time. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. I spoke to a few of them including the brewmaster. Their beer knowledge is excellent as are their brews. I tried all they had to offer and they were all very good. One of them had an odd flavor and after speaking with the brewer he agreed and will make some tweaks. This is how you know a good beer man! I will be back anytime I get to that side of town. I encourage everyone who wants good beer, music and an overall great time to check them out."

It was an IPA,  he put it on ice to chill it before we tried it.  It was delicious,  you could taste the different flavor profiles as it warmed up in the glass.  We drank the whole growler that evening.  It tasted like a session IPA,  we will definitely be going back.  If you ever get caught in bad traffic in SA,  stop into some of the local establishments.  You will find some of the best kept secrets in the San Antonio Texas or anywhere in Texas.  We kind of keep to ourselves sometimes and everybody is family/familia in Texas."

You open a tab at the register and are given a card to use at the tap.  There are 30 taps on the wall that are constantly rotating with both local and national craft beers.  You are charged by the ounce and each beer has a different price per ounce (generally ranging from $0.45 to $0.65 / ounce.  There are beer menu's posted that have a description of each beer.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.    They do have numerous events during the week with some pup-up food trucks.  My only issue is my own fault - it is amazing how quick the tab adds up!  In transparency, the screen displays the cost of the most recent pour and it also shows the total for your visit."

I've been twice now, and they had some variation in the beer selection between visits. It leans pretty heavy in the IPA/pale ale direction, along with some sours, pilsners, and cider options. There's also a lot of local and Texas selections. The best part about serving yourself is you don't have to commit to a full pour...you can feel free to try as many as you want without a huge amount.   While the food options are limited, we were able to find some good snacks to eat while we were there! We got the pretzel, which is a given with beer...and delicious, as well as some of the other snack and sandwich options. The food isn't the best (the beer is def the focus), I still was pleasantly surprised at the options and quality.   When you enter, they are happy to explain the process fully so you won't feel like you don't know what's going on. Now we just need more of these places in SA!"

                "description": "Look, this is a great place to go and have a couple of drinks and enjoy the company of your friends and family.  If you are expecting to go for dinner and have a meal, go somewhere else that has a menu and a host or hostess to seat you.  That being said, the food we had for brunch was very good and the portions were good for the price.If you really just want to go and have the ability to sample a bunch of beer and have some light food to go along with your brew, then the Dooryard is definitely the place to be.  I walked in and obviously I was a newbie because they guided me through the process to get started, BUT they were very helpful and happy to assist.  The staff is wonderful and explained everything I needed to know from loading my card to pouring the beer and paying for food on a separate app.    The beer, oh the beer, I consider myself a beer snob and I love dark beers such as porters and stouts.  Believe it or not, they had a great selection of beer that made me happy and what was even better, I was able to try what I wanted and not feel any guilt or buyers remorse in getting  a pour that is disappointingly small.  Here, you get any size of what you want and as much as you want in any glass that you want it in (providing you know what glass you should pour it in).   Anyway, bottom line is, you will be excited to come back just as I am and what is even better, Jason (the owner) is there and very chill and approachable when you are visiting.  He thanked us as we were closing out our tab and I assured him that he would definitely get a great review from me.  Hurry up and get there so that you can enjoy your experience and be as excited as I am to go back."

You enter the establishment and are greeted by a worker. Show ID. Run your credit/debit card and you're given a Dooryard card. Grab your dooryard card and head over to the beers. Grab the glass of your choosing and a napkin. Once you've decided on your beer, put the card in the black slot, napkin on the nozzle, tilt your glass to 45 degrees and pour! You get charged by the oz so drink as little or as much as you like! DO NOT FORGET YOUR CARD! Or you may be buying beers for others haha   What I REALLY loved about this place is a lot of the beers on tap were Texas Breweries. A local business supporting local business! Love it!  I loved the open area. The guys I went with felt it looked too much like a Jamba Juice / froyo place. I guess they wanted a more \"masculine\" feel to it? Less orange and more...brown? Idk lol I came for the beers and succeeded!  As for the food - ehhhhh. I'd say eat before you come here and then you can snack on the food here. My friend ordered the rueben. The photo shows a pickle but I guess they ran out so they gave him sliced cucumber that tasted like they threw pickle juice over it haha we laughed about that for a little.   Come here for the brews and bring some company! I don't recommend coming alone unless you're gonna take a rideshare or taxi. You can EASILY go from drinking 1 beer to 12 lol not kidding.   Come check out Dooryard! So far it's my favorite beer establishment in SA!!"

                "description": "I recently read an article on NPR about the relatively new phenomenon of \"self serve taprooms.\" It argues that overhead caused by labor and an unpredictable market will inevitably force businesses to reconsider their strategies. Necessity is the mother of invention as they say and the pandemic is facilitating a \"think outside the box\" approach. The Dooryard, the city's first self serve taproom of its kind is hastening that notion. As I came here for a sneak preview a few questions did come to mind? Are patrons ready to forgo the experience of going to a taproom only to have to serve themselves? What about the interaction between customer and server? Will that be replaced by machines?  For every glass that I have a question for there is an empty one that needs to be filled; presumably with answers. Firstly it is everything you might be looking for in a taproom. It's sleek, simply decorated and spacious. There is patio seating with heating lamps. I'm wondering how it will look in the summer. So you probably want to know how this place works don't you? Well you go to the front counter where you start a tab. You are given an e-card that tracks everything you drink. You choose a clean glass from a rack of different styles: stout, pint, pilsner or a snifter. It's much like the soda dispensaries at a theater in theory but with craft beer instead. You use a paper cup to cover tap handles, thus limiting contact.  One thing that is really helpful is that they post their taplist via online. My suggestion is that you survey it beforehand. Selections are separated and displayed by number. You place your card on the slot and you pour to your liver's content. The owner, I presume was really friendly. He came around from the counter and graciously showed me how the process worked. This is where your skills as a tapmaster or lack thereof are going to shine through. I must reiterate you are charged by the ounce. As you serve yourself there is a display that tells you the dollar amount of each pour. It's like pumping gas but instead it's beer. In the NPR article it said the benefits of utilizing this method is the consistency of pours. This is to stave off waste. Therein lies the dilemma or the trade off.  If this is an alternative to saving taprooms/breweries will tapmasters be a thing of the past?  Everytime you go to get another round you must use a clean glass and a fresh handle cup. In that sense it is like the Golden Corral but with hops. Sitting and surveying the space I wondered how this concept will fare with patrons. Which did bring up scenarios. How will the process be explained to newcomers? Will people complain if pours have too much head? Are people going to try to haggle over a miscalculated pour? Again some beers are priced from 50 cents and up an ounce. Make sure to have a calculator handy. Before you know it you might leave with a healthy tab. I must add that I enjoyed my experience here. The owner was extremely friendly, helpful and explained the process in simplest terms.   The Dooryard is a concept that people  will either embrace or forgo. Isn't the point of going to a taproom to let someone serve you? It surely can't be waiting in a line for someone to decide on a beer! It must be somewhere in between. Whether we like it or not there is a new paradigm shift. Adapt or fade away. I say give this place a try. At least the machine won't ignore you when you got to have your ipa fix."

                "description": "I have been here three times since they open a couple of weeks ago. The concept is something completely new to San Antonio but I have been to a number of these over the years. I have to say that they are handling it better than any others I have seen. The way that their system ties into untappd makes things all the better for a beer connoisseur. I've spent a lot of time speaking with the owners about the concept and what their plans are and I have to tell you I am very excited about the future of this place. I consider myself a regular already even though I live on the other side of town. I will be sure to make this a weekly if not biweekly start from now on. Already since I've been there they have changed out more than Half a dozen beers to something new. That is key in any kind of good beer establishment.  I encourage anyone in the area who enjoys craft beer to come and have some at the door yard. The owner has already told me they're looking at possibly doing another one so let's make sure this one's a success."

My wife and I asked another couple if they were interested in trying it and the instantly said yes.  We all liked the selection of beers and hard ciders, oh and they do have a small selection of wine behind the bar.  For my drinks I tried the Fiesty Redhead and the Big Spoon.  For food we ordered the Charcuterie plate, I had the Banh Mi sandwich and my wife ordered the Ruben sandwich.  For dessert I had one of the pretzels.  Everything was delicious and like most places you order on your phone.  All 4 of us really enjoyed the Dooryard and will be back"

                "description": "I've been anticipating the opening for about a month now and I finally got to try it today. I certainly love the concept and they had a very diverse food menu. To start, there's a bit of a learning curve with trying to figure out how to order food and getting the card for the drinks. Once you get the hang of it, then it's pretty easy!   For the food, I was excited to see so many different Asian options, and I was hopeful about how it would turn out. All the pieces were right, but somehow they didn't come together for me.   Banh Mi: the bread was super soft and fluffy, the pork belly was so tender and well marinated. THEY ADDED PATE! But I would say it's pretty pate heavy. It's not your traditional banh mi, but you could tell they tried.   Ribs: they were more soy than anything so don't worry if you're not a ginger fan. I wish it was a little sweeter, but the ribs were tasty.   Pork Buns: the buns were soft. It was a very fresh tasting bun, you could taste the mint and pickled onion. I would like a little more sauce on the pulled pork, maybe some hoisin?   For the beers, it was really fun getting to pour your own glass. The selection rotates often, so you'll always have something new to try. I would come back for the self serve drinks, and maybe bring some friends once this pandemic is over"

Limited selection. They have a wall where you go help yourself to specialized beer.of all kinds. Seltzer included. They give you a card to scan your purchases. Our group congregated outside in the patio. They brought out a heater at customer's request. My friend was going to show me her new Jeep and the bartender rushed out to see if we were skipping the bill. We just laughed and assured him we were not. Unfortunately, I didn't try any of the menu items. I had two bottles of Cabernet fir a total of $53.00"

                "description": "Here are my thoughts for the Dooryard, a new neighborhood find for that afternoon brew on a casual afternoon. Marjan had actually been here twice before, so this review is a distillation of her experiences and my recent visit.  Nestled within an oak tree rich strip center, this beer lovers paradise is a relatively new concept in our world.  Enter, plop down your credit card, and you are each given a \"charge card\" that you use to self serve from a tap of two dozen brews.  Above the line of taps is a changeable board that describes their different offerings;  the fare tends to regional craft beers, so do not expect to find a Miller Lite or a Modelo.  We are talking the language of small craft, esoterically known brews.  And herein lies the beauty of the concept:  read the lists, and serve yourself as little or as much of the brew as you choose.  Remember that \"charge card\"  you are given upon entry?  Slip it above your choice, and the card reader bills you for the amount you might serve yourself. It is kind of like filling your BMW with gas!  So, yes, there is the \"unknown\" of the brews offered, but the descriptions tend to be reasonably accurate of those on tap.  For our particular visit, the brews tended to more of the flavored varieties:  we favored a tangerine tinged wheat brew from New Orleans, and a chocolate flavored ale from Boulder.  Talking with the staff, more \"traditional\" beers like a weinstephaner or a pilsner can be available, but alas, not for our visit today.  There is a limited wine list, and some of the ferments seemed of good quality, and reasonably priced.  A 375 ml bottle of Meiomi for example, can be had for about $17.00.  This is about $8.00 for a glass:  not too bad in our opinion.  There are comestibles on the menu, but we did not order.  During Marjan's previous visit, she did order their version of a charcuterie board, and it was...adequate.  We would defer to other reviewers for their opinions.  As this is a self serve venue, you must use a new, clean glass, of varying size, each time you sidle up to the taps.  The spacing of tables indoor is pandemic appropriate, and there is seating on picnic tables outside on their deck.  And lest we forget, the venue is pet friendly, so your furry friends can sit at your table...but they do not get a charge card....joking!  The staff is uber friendly, welcoming and helpful.  This is going to be one of our favorite places, and we can heartily recommend the friendly, casual neighborhood vibe of the place.  Hope to see you there!!  Enjoy!"

We also had the meat and cheese board, which was ultra basic and made with low quality meats and cheeses. Lastly the lamb wraps with mint sauce were uninspired and basic.  The overall indoor decor is basic and plain. The outdoor setting is nice and does have heating with gas lamps.  The beer selection is the win. But if you are hungry don't bother.   P.S. no bearing on my rating but the staff lacks people skills and isn't worth tipping. To be expected when you pay and tip before you even receive the food."

Service was great. Price point was awesome. Pizza was really good and surprised about the BBQ Brisket pizza which my guest and I thought was perfect.   Lot of beer options, stouts, ipas, session ipas, \"Berliners\", lagers, etc. only reason I gave Freetail 4 out of 5 stars was that out of the three beers I tried none of them were really, really good or anything to really write home about. Pretty basic flavor profiles and the berliner wasn't really a berliner. Wish the beers had a stronger flavor profile - if you say Mango but some mango it in so you can taste it, not just a hint of one. Other than that, it was a good experience."

She didn't know whether or not they could show it and it took 3 staff to find out after I told them what station.  I guess they don't know how to search cable lol.  When they found it, they choose the \"spanish channel\" lol. My favorite hostess wasn't there either.  However the \"Vader Saber\" was amaze-ballz as was the pizza.  I can't wait till I go back."

For the food we got the red pepper hummus and I would NOT recommend this. It was missing the \"hummus\" taste, can't explain it but it was a no for me. And last we ordered the brisket nachos for 75 ppl! Haha! Just kidding but this is a meal for 2 people, it was plenty!! The only thing I would say is the beans taste like from a can, I would have loved a little more Mexican tasting beans.  I wish I would have tried the pizza, next time!!!"

The tables, bathroom, floor, literally everything was dirty in here. The smell behind the kitchen and bar was the finishing touch. This wasn't the first time we've seen it like this lately. This has always been one of our favorite places the past six years or so but lately it looks like they've lost focus."

Not a huge beer person but I had a flight of 4 beers and LOVED them all, and their chicken bacon ranch pizza was so so good for food not being their primary attraction! Highly recommend!

The place is dog-friendly and has bowls for puppers outside on the deck.  Great beer menu mostly local and great on-tap options.  Absolutely recommend visiting and checking it out for yourself. They usually have a great playlist too! At least during the point in time when I'd visit.  Here's where I watched the Spurs championship in 2014 and it was a huge blast!!! Enjoy!!"

The beer was decent and the pizza was good but the service was downright AWFUL. Our server, Andrea, was so unbelievably rude to our entire table and was even rude to other servers! She rolled her eyes multiple times when my mother asked her questions about the beer and wine selection. Another server came by and asked her a question and she was very rude to her as well! One of the other servers walked by our table and my wife asked to speak to a manager because our pizza was taking a while... we were informed that our server, Andrea, was in fact a manager. Never going back to this place. We'll stick to the taproom downtown if we want Freetail beer."

We decided to try the Artichoke and Goat Cheese dip which was light and tasty. I took the seasonal \"La Muerta\" to go which was $16 a bottle but in my opinion, worth it."

They have a great selection of beers, they're really quick(will give you your pour right as you're paying), there's lot of large tables for groups, and if you're hungry there's Project Pollo's food truck parked outside of it.  I'm an IPA drinker so I've dipped into every IPA they have on their beer list and they're all great. The table next to us had a chess match going. A great place for dog lovers, plenty of doggos here enjoying pets.  Have came here a handful of times and have always had a great experience. The staff is top notch, cheers!"

I finally got around to going with a friend and her BF.  He was into beer and she was okay with it as well.  The space was a nice converted storefront and staff was friendly even as it got busier. The beers I had were pretty good, I'm into sours and their one was good.   I appreciated that they had a food truck permanently attached to their space but it was a vegan chicken spot, which was not really what I'm looking for when I'm drinking a beer."

Highlight of the stop was the excellent beer, with styles for everyone and everything I tasted was really well done. Setup is awesome, with a ton of space and great vibes. Both a brewery dog AND brewery cat lounging around and added to the chill, welcoming, community brew vibes. Just a great place to hang, would be really great for a group outing, or a date night. Lots to like at Roadmap! Anytime I am passing through I will make it a point to swing in. Drink local!"

Beers are unlike California IPAs with a little more bitterness to it. Cute tanks! Like it's a home brew place. :) If you're tired of the riverwalk and chain beers take a scooter and come here. The riverwalk don't have taps from some of these smaller breweries."

I'm not a huge beer drinker but they seem to have a beer for everyone. They welcome you to stay and enjoy with board games, corn hole, giant jenga, and even encourage you to bring food or order food to eat while you're there. They have some TV's to watch the games that are on and also see some snacks as well. They usually always have food trucks outside which always have great food!   COVID procedures: I feel that they are taking great precautions to continue great service while also keeping patrons and employees safe. Hand sanitizer everywhere, roped off lines to make it one-way to order food or snacks and one-way entrance and exits. They have tables outside as well, about 4-5 tables that seat about 4 people each."

                "description": "First off let me give credit where credit is due, back unturned has phenomenal pizza and beer, seriously some of the best pizza I've had in awhile, the restaurant is a cool hangout spot near downtown, but they're not without their problems.  First time I came here I was beyond disappointed; I set up for a weekend date with my wife to try this spot out before catching a movie. Parking was a pain, we had to pay a meter or pay for the parking they offered in their lot. Unfortunately, they were hosting an event in the back lot with a $25 dollar cover charge! We just wanted to grab some pizza and  beer in which their normal dining room wasn't available, only the special event! If you want to have special events fine, but don't  strong arm all your customer who go out of their way just to grab a bite! So we payed for parking and had to spend our money elsewhere.  I gave them another shot this past week and my overall experience had highs and lows.  First of the negatives, they're pricing is high, probably not worth it for one person tab, you can't get out of here without paying $25-30bucks for a pizza, and a couple beers. Two people would be a better value but still they don't have hot and ready prices if that's what you're expecting. The wait staff wasn't very attentive and didn't check on us much, kinda just had a \"MEH\" attitude.   Despite all this, their pizza and beer it's pretty freaking awesome. Their crust is perfect, crispy and thin with just the perfect amount of pull when you bite into it. Their toppings are all above average soooooo good, probably reflecting the higher than average prices. The spicy Hawaiian had the typical controversial pineapple but more I've a sweet and tangy sauce with loads of bacon and jalapeÃ±o, really an awesome reinvention of the sweet and salty play on pizza!  I do wish their pizzas we're a bit larger, even if the amount of toppings stay the same just give us more of that beautiful crust, sauce and cheese!  Also I will say they were a little light on sauce fore me personally.   Their wings were not my favorite, I'm not big on baked wings, they were lest crispy and more chewy. Baked or grilled can be just as good as fried but think they needed longer or turn the temp up to get those crispy edges!  Their beer gets an A plus, you can't go bad with any options especially when paired with a good pizza."

                "description": "Decided it was time to try the brunch menu today.  At first I decided to order off the small sides just to try a few plates. However, the honeyed goat cheese toast was on the menu but no longer offered :(   So I went with blueberry French toast and a side of bacon. The bacon was not really cooked enough for my taste, but it had a good flavor. The French toast is made from sour dough which means it does not soak up a custard and it gets crusty on the sides. I liked the flavors but was not as expected.  Loved the mimosa. Good size for only $6."

He said \"i enjoyed it but wouldn't be back if i was back in town\"   We loved our experience here though our waiter was really good at explaining to us the different beers they had and gave us great recommendations.   We got one pepperoni pizza to eat with the beer and it was really good! its very very thin so if you're not about that then don't get pizza haha  You can also buy their beer as a 6 pack in cans which i thought was really cool.   I agree.. I don't know if I would be back but I would recommend to those who haven't been.  from the outside it may seem abandoned and even a restaurant so don't think your gps took you to the wrong place like we though."

It is very near the Riverwalk, so we decided to come in and have a beer. Good choice.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was a younger guy and I ordered an IPA, it was solid.  The bartender was nice and gave me some free stickers and everyone was having a great time.  Great little tap room, especially after a great BBQ dinner at Augie's."

                "description": "We have tickets at the Tobin Center and wanted to eat close by beer our show. We are always interested in local breweries and my husband loves pizza, plus this was a quick walk on the Riverwalk. I like that you can get your pizza in the six inch size. We ordered two different ones (pepperoni Gorgonzola and the Formaggio e Bacon). Both were delicious, but we preferred the Gorgonzola one, which also had a balsamic glaze. The service was excellent. I'm sure this place is really busy on the weekend. Not too bad for a Wednesday, either. We'll definitely be back. This is a thin crust pizza, so if that's not your jam, you should know that. It's hard to find a Porter or stout at the micro breweries around here, so we were pleased with the milk stout tonight. Anyone that can point me to more local dark beers? We look forward to trying the Rio De Leeches and the double chocolate coconut when they get it on tap."

                "description": "We'll definitely return. But not for the service.  Our waiter, a guy with a calf tattoo wasn't unfriendly, but he wasn't welcoming either. Kind of aloof if I'm being honest.    We order the Rio de Leche and a cold brew with vanilla sweet cream.  The former is a sweet stout, much like you'd expect a dulce de leche stout to taste. The cold brew was properly bold and very refreshing for today's heat.   To eat,  the prosciutto, mushroom, and arugula (an upcharge) pizza. The pizzas are 6-inches at the biggest, it seems, and this particular pie was topped with shaved parm and mozzarella. We'd definitely get this again. I ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast, which wasn't a prominently strawberry dish. Instead, it was only topped with one berry, thinly sliced. Very disappointed with this as I feel it was a bait and switch. The \"stuffing\" was a thin custard which was tasty.  The bread was a sourdough that complimented the sweetness of the filling very well.  They offer a 10% military discount and that's always a nice gesture. Parking may be iffy on busy nights, but we were able to find a spot right outside with no issues. The interior, also, looks like it can get packed on busy weekends. The one downside to the meals is that there's no heat lamps on the pass (which is just a metal rack) so unless you're waitstaff is on it, food may get cold as it waits for pick up."

They have their beers ready to go in 16 oz cans and you can mix and match a 4 pack. Our beer choices come in 4 oz and 10 oz pours and you can get the 16 oz can for a little more, I noticed. So you might want to try buying the can and just asking for a glass, which would save $$. I wish their outdoor seating was a little nicer and bigger, but after that first taste of ice cold beer...it really doesn't matter. Their menus are all on-line and easily accessible."

It's definitely the best way to try a few of their beers at once with getting inebriated. I loved them all.  The food here is pretty good too. We shared the puttanesca pizza, wings and black bean hummus.  The pizza was just as I like it. The crust was thin and crispy. It had enough sauce, cheese and toppings.  The hummus came with warm pita bread. It did taste a lot like black beans, so keep that in mind when ordering. It was also a small portion. I would say it is enough for two people only.   The wings- mango habanero.  They weren't too spicy. They are twice baked. Good flavor. Not too sweet. Good portion for sharing.  They have inside and outside seating. Both are limited and with social isolation practices, it makes the seating even more limited. We were able to get seated pretty quickly. Parking is street parking. Staff was great."

Saturday, we finally decided to check it out even though we don't have a fido. It was surely a busy time!  My husband decided to try the bone-in chicken wings and got the 12 piece with BBQ sauce and the Korean Pepper sauce. I decided to get the kid's meal with 6 boneless wings, tots and apple juice. We did get a Bark-arita to share too with 2 mango, 2 prickly pear, 1 strawberry and 1 lime. Great flavor with the chicken wings! The tater tots were awesome. They originally gave me the fries instead of the tots and then I got a bonus portion of tots! The Bark-arita was actually a lot to share between the 2 of us. Maybe a draft beer next time!  Love the outdoor space, the fan with misters and seeing people with their pooches. Definitely will be back for the wings again and try other foods."

They also have live music here to enjoy on the weekends.  The weekend we stopped by with our two dogs, there was a dog spa service as well.  They have bars located by the dog park areas so you can watch your dogs while enjoying alcoholic beverages.  Make sure to start a tab at the main building to be able to order drinks at the dog park. I haven't tried the food menu yet, but I did see that they serve food for dogs!  My dogs enjoyed being off leash inside the large dog park, where they can play with other dogs.  Make sure to hold on to your drinks when dogs get rowdy and body slam your table.  The floors are astro turf with rocks around the fencing area so you don't have to worry about your dogs getting dirty.  I'm excited to come back to have fun with the dogs!"

There is 2 areas for dawgs (small and large) in a separate area than the sitting area.  There are games to play out there and we went to it out with a puppy.  Got the bacon cheeseburger that was alright, not the best.  The bartender rocked and got us into some other local beers.  It was slow when we got there around noon on Sunday (9/12/21), but started to pick up around 1PM.  If you are looking to enjoy the nicer SA weather outside with your dawg, this place is it.  They had some happy hour deals during the week."

                "description": "Just found out about this place and had to take my pup for an outing! A friend and I went to eat and take our pups to play. I ordered the loaded tots and a shrimp salad. I ordered a side of chicken and bacon for my pup. The tots are so amazing! I could go back for those any day. The salad was pretty good. My pup loved interacting with other dogs and munching on the pup food although it looked a little greasy to be made specifically for the pups. Overall loved the atmosphere and all of the adorable pups and food. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars are for the over abundance of water spraying fans that they wouldn't consider turning off, not even one and the fact you have to pretty much get up before a server gets back to your table but they may have a lack of staff so it's understandable too."

                "description": "If you happen to be on this side of town, it's a great spot to stop and enjoy a margarita or some appetizers when the weather is nice. Simple ordering station with easy to read menu (though we needed to ask the host for some specifics regarding toppings on the loaded tots and nachos.) The bar area was long and provided several beer options as well as frozen 'ritas. It was a ladies night out, so we each ordered a margarita flight and headed outside. Note: seating inside was limited, making this a hard pass on a rainy or super hot day. We were welcomed by tons of outdoor picnic tables and relaxed while we waited for them to bring out our appetizers. Although we didn't bring our furry friends, there seems to be a decent spot for them to run around and play- and a wooden playscape for the kiddos. The margarita flight presentation was on point, but some of the flavors were less than stellar. After ordering, we noticed several other patrons come out with flights that looked different than ours. Perhaps there's a secret menu that only the cool kids know? I'll definitely ask next time! Nachos were delicious.... And the potential is there. One downfall was we were apparently sitting near the \"smoking section\" without realizing. While I appreciate the effort- I wish it had been a smoke free environment all together. Check it out!"

Seriously, this is such a cool neighborhood restaurant that's worth a visit. It's very kid and dog friendly. I absolutely enjoyed their outdoor sitting that had fans with misters throughout the area.   Diners have to place their orders near the entrance of the restaurant and then wait for the food to be delivered to them. We went with the garlic Parmesan wings, bacon burger, loaded fries and browned brussel sprouts. Personally not a fan of the wings since I like mine served dry. Wings were way too saucy. Will go with burger options next time I'm back.  Margarita flight was good. Always nice having the option to try out different flavors.  All together, this place has such a fun atmosphere. They had live music just as we were leaving. I can see why this has become a hot spot in our neighborhood in the short amount of time it's been open."

Usually pictures don't do a place justice but go flip through all the pictures and ask yourself why you have been here yet!?!? It truly is as good as it looks!! I looooove being able to order my food/drinks etc right of the patio. Also being able to have my furry friend hanging out with us at the same time is sooooo fun!!     The food was fantastic, the service was quick and friendly, all the staff across the board was on point and best of all..... IT WAS VERY CLEAN!!! Not like most dog parks you go to lol    We went around 6pm on a Friday. The crowd was nice and didn't feel cramped or overwhelmed by dogs/people. However when we left around 8pm (while the sun was almost completely set) it was really starting to get packed. (So go at 6 lol)    I'm telling you, get your family and your favorite 4 legged friend and get over there!!!"

Lots of pups to ooh and ahh over, too!!  Service was friendly, the food was reasonably priced and the drink selection was varied, with everything from craft beers to margarita flights (the owners are the same folks who run Burleson Beer Garden, so if you like their margaritas, you're in luck).  My favorite part (of course) was the dog park, where you can hang out with your friends while your furbaby plays with his or her friends!  There are water bowls, toys and even a ball-throwing machine!  My dog had a blast and slept all the way home!  When we went, there wasn't any shade in the picnic table area, but there are umbrellas all over the place now.  We can't wait to return!"

                "description": "Longtab Brewery is a welcomed addition to this area of San Antonio's culinary scene, they have excellent micro brewed beer crafted in house, and only beer crafted in their house, beer lover or not you have to appreciate the love they show to it.    All in all this is an excellent place to hang and grab a couple of  beers, with excellent snacks and sandwiches once that buzzed hunger monster strikes. I will say though not to treat this as a gastro pub, their focus is much more on the beer and less on the food.  Not to say the food isn't good, my grilled ham and cheese was excellent! But It was simple, most people could've made it at home in about ten min.  That's not a jab to the restaurant, it's simple and makes sense and I enjoyed it thoroughly!   My dad had the brat and same theme, it's was very good but very simple, just something to tie you over with your brews.   As far as negatives I did notice a few things but honestly they're more of observations. I would say a appreciate the small fresh menu but it's a little overly simple for my taste, at the very least give an option for fries as opposed to chips or some kinda interesting sides! Maybe some German themed beers ones to compliment the beer types even and entrÃ©es.  A couple more menu items sure would be nice, especially something that wasn't hand held, I think that would really get them closer to a 5 start spot.  Also pricing for the portion size I would say price if is flirting the line of being high, beer seems to be pretty average cost wise.   Also service wasn't bad or anything but it was very laid back, almost a little too laid back if you know what I mean. And as much as I love the view of the awesome brewery vats and equipment without a glass dividing wall like most places similar to this place have, you get all those  strong smells associated with it, it could be a little off-putting for some but not unbearable.   All in all a great place to hangout and grab a few beers and maybe a snack or two, it's nice to see more places like this making their way to SA and sticking to their guns, this is not your sub par bar or ice house by far."

Located in an area full of car repair shops, you could easily pass it up.   This place is for everyone. It's a coffee shop, brewery and they have food. They also serve wine for those that don't want beer or coffee.  The most surprising thing is that their food is legit. It's delicious and they serve large portions. I didn't expect much from their food, but I was wrong. They also sell canned beer and coffee to go.   We started by sharing the soft pretzel. It's a perfect appetizer for beer.   For my meal, I had the Blackened shrimp hoagie. it came with large pieces of shrimp. It was perfectly seasoned. The side was house seasoned chips. I can't complain. It was a good meal.   For beer, you can always as for half pours so you can try most than one. This place sells typical beer. Nothing too crazy.   The wine served is from Messina Hof. It seems like they support local Texas businesses. They also have cake thieves bakery items for sale.   There's plenty of options for seating. Parking is available on site."

I was pleasantly surprised to find this place opened up in my old stomping grounds and I was none the wiser, shame on me. So, here I go to check it out and soon find Longtab in a commercial business park that I have driven by hundreds of times before.  As I walk up, you'll notice the outside is painted in Army green and this is for a purpose. Come to find, this establishment is owned and operated by former Special Forces members and Green Berets. To all, thank you for your service! Upon entry, I was greeted with a friendly, \"hello and you can sit wherever you like\". The inside is super clean and neat. There is a front area with tables and a separate back area with sofa and more tables.   After looking the menu over, I start of with the pulled pork sandwich and the Stilleto. The Stilleto is a Belgian brown that is dark but not super heavy and had notes of coffee and chocolate. Good bold taste.  Next, the pulled pork sandwich came out and I was ready to sink my teeth into this bad boy. The meat was super tender, juicy and season well. The challah bread was soft and soaked up all the juicy goodness from the meat. The side of black pepper kettle chips paired well with the sandwich and completed the meal.  I asked one of the managers about there selection of beers and he told me that they do rotate the offerings and will have seasonal offerings as they become available so I'll be sure to keep up to date on that.  Overall, I really like this place and the fact it is so close to me and that it support those that have supported us makes me definitely want to come back."

They need to give you more beer cheese dip because the one cup won't remotely take care of how big the pretzel is. The currywurst and bratwursts were so delicious. The beers were so smooth and we tried a variety. I did end up spending more money than I expected because the environment lended itself to a fun time. The servers and bartenders were so fun and friendly. They were attentive, talked to patrons and made the atmosphere lively. The crowd is diverse but primarily veterans since it's a veteran owned small business. They are only open till 10 pm during the week which was a bummer because I could have enjoyed that atmosphere much longer. Looks like I'll need to come back soon. Hidden off of Bandera road; it's close to our home at the border of Leon Valley/San Antonio. They also have a wide variety of glassware you can purchase as well as apparel with their logo. Great times and I'll see you soon!"

All the food was served hot and tasted great, really enjoyed the pairings for the sausage plate. Loved the music played and overall atmosphere as well. Our server was not good though; she was slow with the orders and of course forgot an item ordered because she negated to write anything down. However, the service recovery was immaculate from the gentleman who came over to apologize about the missing dish and had it quickly sent out. Did not do dessert but did bring the peaches and cream cheese pop pastry to my niece. She said it reminded her of an empanada and she liked it a lot."

Nick, the manager, was hospitable and very knowledgeable of both the food, beer, coffee AND wine!!! Read that again!!!! Yes.  Coffee is from WA state and is very smooth.  Guatemalan single origin is amazing!!!!!Wine selection is all TX.....GSM is the perfect choice!!!!! The food is flavorful and addicting!!  Pork nachos were soooo delicious.  And we wanted to order a pretzel and a sandwich but were more focused on the beer!!  Bathroom was clean AND had an awesome speaker to enjoy tunes as you go!!!  Veteran owned from SA!!!!   This is an amazing establishment with regulars that make you feel at home.  Staff is so friendly and kind.  Oh and they have weekend specials!!! Will have to do another post for that!!!  Your next date or new place experience IS HERE!!!  See you here soon!!!"

One last note, Doppelbock is spelled dopplebock on the can."

We were so happy we went.  All I know is I don't want too many people to find it because we love going when it's not too busy because their servers have time to hang out and give insight to the food and beers. So far we have not found anything we do not like about Longtab Brewing Co.  What will keep taking us back is the Loaded Bavarian Pretzel and the cool playlist.  As for wine I am in awe of their Admiral Nimitz Foundation Admiral's Reserve (Dessert).  Also they are a coffee house and I've yet to try one but I will be soon."

For food, there's a variety of sandwiches and snacks in case you're hungry.  They have optional spacious indoor and outdoor seating ready.  Also, sometimes there are events being hosted by the brewery.  A must try spot!"

Overall the place is pretty relaxing to grab a beer and enjoy the day especially on a fall afternoon."

They smoke their own pork and turkey, which was delicious.  Food: Pulled pork nachos were pretty damn good. Would definitely get again.   Drinks: They have a pretty decent list of beers. Not the greatest variety but they have their focuses and they do a great job.   We would for sure return and maybe bring a football to play on their 50 year field in front of the tables."

There is plenty of outdoor seating and they are now offering table service to ensure social distancing. We started off with a few of the beers (both of which were delicious) and a giant pretzel! The pretzel was hot and very soft, and served with a very tasty mustard. The staff was very friendly and gave us a few recommendations as we tried another couple of beers during our visit. Overall a wonderful place to spend a few hours and grab a drink, especially on a nice day! We will definitely be coming back again soon."

I had a little trouble finding it because there is construction going on in surrounding area, but I did not give up! I knew it was going to be worth finding!   I was right. They have a massive parking lot, so no worries on finding a spot. The brewery is more than just a line of taps. There is a large biergarten area with benches and plenty of games to play. Large bathrooms in a separate building as well which are super clean. While there is not a ton of seating at the main bar, you can easily find a spot to sit or stand just about anywhere else. This brewery hosts a ton a big events that draw large crowds such as Oktoberfest, a wing festival and even a weekly bacon and bingo night.   My visit was extra pleasant thanks to the awesome staff. Big shoutout to Stephanie who was the best beertender I have come across in a LONG time! Super friendly, very helpful and just a genuinely awesome person who made my visit to Alamo Beer a five star experience. She helped me pick an awesome beer to enjoy and I will definitely return next time I am in the area. Bring your family and friends!"

Came on a date night and decided to go for a flight to have a variety. Flights come in 4s.  My memory is too bad to remember the names but I mostly go for the light beers. I truly enjoyed everything I sampled and the beer was so fresh from the tap.   Great environment to hang out with friends, kids, and your dog. I saw a lot people with dogs and kids. On the website it says they host tours on Thursdays and Saturdays for free and you do not have to make reservations, but must wear closed toe shoes. They also have a corn hole league for the competitive sports fans.    Also, ladies the restrooms are amazing. Plenty of stalls and they are roomy. They kept the restroom very clean and stocked with the essentials."

Leaving a bad review in a pandemic of a local business is generally poor taste in my opinion but since this place clearly doesn't care about the pandemic why should I???  Place had a huge, crowded line inside with NO MASK OR SOCIAL DISTANCING REENFORCEMENT WHATSOEVER. And the lady behind the counter was wearing an ineffective glittery mesh mask that I could see through! There were signs up for it but everyone in this industry knows damn well no one reads signs and you're gonna have to tell people to put their freaking mask on and follow the rules.  On another note the guys working the counter were lovely and I'm sorry they have to work somewhere with such little regard to their health well being. Do better!"

We even ended up watching the Superbowl here- it was quiet but that just meant a prime viewing area for us.  The layout is of a beer hall and the beer is quality.  Very chill spot, excellent bartender, enough space for a heck of a lot of people both in and outdoors, and an overall fun place.  Our bartender allowed us to try the beer before we bought, was knowledgeable and easy to carry a convo with.  Even though during the two times we went, there was a food truck parked outdoors, I do wish Alamo served some sort of food inside (hot pretzels or popcorn snacks would be a nice addition).  I also wish the bathrooms weren't located outside. A very safe place but it was still somewhat sketchy going at night.  Everything else is excellent and the points mentioned above become easy to forgive otherwise!"

We had the Golden Ale (my personal favorite) and the Amber Lager (my boyfriend's favorite). The atmosphere was very chill, and the bar is open air with indoor and outdoor seating. The staff are very friendly, and they're quick to get you a refill. This is definitely our new go-to for TX craft beer."

There's a couple of tables available, spaced out well for groups, and some bar seating available. The bartender was super helpful and got us set up with some flights and charcuterie board! Got to try every beer on tap and really found something for everyone in our group. The charcuterie board was a nice snack, and when we ran out of bread it was replenished so we could finish of the hummus and cheese!"

                "description": "We came here on a whim last week and it turned out they JUST got to reopen since covid started and we were their FIRST customers since covid! The way it is now is that you can not only buy a pint anymore. To meet the covid requirement, you buy a commemorative covid cup that comes with tokens to redeem 2 drinks and one snack. I hate the waste of plastic, but I get it. The cup is funny too.   It seemed like there is quite a following of the brewery though. We were only there for an hour and there were two groups of guys that came in with their pints. I guess there was a discount if they brought in their own pint(?) I'm probably wrong. But everyone seemed to know each other and it seemed wholesome."

                "description": "Ok, Let's Review... First time here and for  \"Porterpalooza\"... Beer selection was good using El Robusto as the base. .  DJ, inside seating, food truck and an alley for a beer garden..( Eh, not great). Bar staff was quick and friendly. They blew out of two selections the first hour in.  Limited ticket sales was a good idea, with limited hours. Steady turn over of patrons and two unisex bathrooms. Not bad.   Even though this was a prepaid event with limited ticket sales, it wasn't organized or well thought out. Several walk-ins were confused and not handled properly outside. Also the times we went to the bar we observed nobody tipping. My partner and I being from the entertainment and service industry,  we found this to be very sad, but expected at a pre paid event.  That doesn't make it right, Millennials.. \"Pay up for service ya cheap bastards!\"  I dunno, we like the products, although not sold in our stores other than a couple of selections in cans and not porters or stouts. Not many on tap at the brewery on Nitro that we experienced or appeared to us when served  They are looking for investors. What they need is a manager to run the tasting rooms and make them enjoyable with the space they have and selections they offer.  Room for improvement, but we like the products."

                "description": "This brewery makes some good brews and deserves some attention!  As others have mentioned, it's on the smallish side, but the good news is, they've busted down the walls and have expanded into the space next door. It's not finished out yet, so it's not the purdiest, but you can still hang out on that side of the joint if you need more room.  They currently have nine brews on tap - IPA's, porters, and even a couple of the standard lagers and wheats for boring guys such as myself.  Six of the beers are available year round, but they have several other seasonal types that are rotated in and out.  Check their web site and look for the \"La Chancla\" series of beers for availability.    Purchase a pint glass for $5 and get $3 refills on Wednesday nights - this is a good deal that you DO NOT WANT TO PASS UP!  Parking is kind of tough and Google Maps takes you to the shopping strip but it's hard to find your way to the front entrance - not the fault of Busted Sandal - totally a Google Maps issue.  Ask for a tour of the brewing room - it's VERY cool, and you get to hear about the entire process and how passionate they are about their brews and the brewing process.  Bonus - there's a really chill and laid back dog that wanders around the place and lounges about.  I don't remember what his name is, but I shall call thee \"Jake\" as it seems to be a fitting name - unless it's a female dog.  :)  The two brews I tried (and thoroughly enjoyed) were:   Finding Friday Mexican Lager  Jeff-E-Weizen (no, I didn't spell it wrong - it's their twist on a traditional Hefeweizen)  Thanks to the Busted Sandal for keeping boring guys (such as myself) who aren't on the latest quest for IPAs or sours in mind.  Love your brews bro!!!"

                "description": "$3 dollar beers on friday's, ugly sweater parties, small room. Dedicated to making its patrons happy with specials all the time. Bring a pint glass, as they sometimes have specials for just bringing your own pint glass. Lively anniversary parties with food trucks and special glasses for anniversaries. I highly recommend getting their early on weekends as their is parking, but far if the main spots are filled. The bathroom is always cleaning and the tour is quick as it is a small but fun packing location.  I like when people are on beer tours from outside the city and provide a varied insight on the drinks. The beers are often on specials on the wall so be sure to stop by and check out the board. They take cash or card."

                "description": "I'm constantly on the hunt for new beers.  So while down in San Antonio for work, I did a drive-by on the beer aisle at the nearby HEB.  One of the beers that caught my eye was Busted Sandal Slippery Rock IPA.  I wish I'd kept walking.  While it tasted like an IPA, it was flat as a pancake.  The cans felt firm when I bought the beer, but lost pressure when I chilled them.  Even a rough pour into a pint glass resulted in no significant head.   What a disappointment...  Too many microbreweries may have great beer inhouse, but they will fail if they can't keep the quality control in their canning operations."

                "description": "I'm a brewery connoisseur, I love all things brewed. Busted Sandal was a spot I stumbled upon miraculously, by the help of the beer gods I'm sure. It's a little hidden gem off of  Fredicksberg and 410, like many in that area. It's a small brewery but very unique indeed. I love the vibes and of course the beer options on tap. Their IPA's are off the chain but the Mexican lager is not too bad it self. The hospitality is top notch and I had a good time with the regulars and bartender. It was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.   My first sample was Finding Friday Mexican Lager their most popular according to Mandy. It's a smooth lighter option but with a nice finish in taste.   Next was the Slippery Rock IPA, which I'm a IPA lover hands down and it was not too hoppy just the right amount of hops and flavor was good for me.   After my fav was the Wine Barre, so unique and different definitely a brine taste that wine has with a beer finish. You have to try it to understand.   Lastly was the Hop Dong IPA, a good way to end the brew adventure and left me wanting more.   I will be returning for the rest of the beers on tap and to visit my new friends. Awesome brewing experience I highly recommend for a cozy low key spot."

I liked how they also offered wine as a drink option. Looks like they are building a 2nd part. We sat in the 2nd part, in the dark, with a fan pointed at us. The chairs aren't too comfortable, as some were falling apart. Prices were great. Need to add more restrooms once they expand."

                "description": "Currently at time of this review: they're doing impromptu beer tours. Nice clean facilities and they can their own and distribute the beer from here! They just started serving beer flights 7/7/18 -9 beers for $15, what a steal! Also they have pint glasses $5 with $3pint refills on Thursdays (hint hint). They serve half pints too and barefoot wine for the winos. Momo and the Staff was so super friendly, homey and even got to meet the brewers who took care to explain each beer! Great selection of beers-I am partial to the porter, Mexican lager, and fire pit wit. Their 210 ale is akin to miller but heftier, aromatic and zillion times better! Can't comment on the IPAs since I'm not an IPA drinker. Watermelon ale was very aromatic, fruity yet light since they use real watermelon and there is high turnover so try it while you can. It's easy to drink if you like fruity beers.   Getting there: when you turn on Oaklawn and see the busted sandal sign it shows a right arrow, but really it's an IMMEDIATE RIGHT AND RIGHT hook around to it.   What a cute little place that is expanding! I never knew it existed so close to me until now as I am leaving SA! They're going to expand the bar area to eventually 20taps and a hang out area. Look out for their anniversary brew in August using a special TX plant!! I really hope they keep their homey feel. Lots of room to grow -looking forward to seeing them the next time I'm in TX! Loved it! (Check out my pix of the place!)"

The door doesn't say what their Sunday hours are but they were open and the bartender, Moses, invited us right in. We ordered a flight of 9 beers for $15 to begin with. The bartender was very informative in explaining each brew to us. We even got to try a new one that they didn't have on the menu yet. Both owners showed up during our visit. One had a good conversation with us about the beers and the other gave us a tour. This brewery is small but they are expanding and renovating. I'm pretty sure we just became regulars."

Came here with girlfriends after enjoying the holiday shopping festival ...which was beautiful scenery and atmosphere. You got to love this location to people watch or even inside where the industrial architecture gives a heat vibe to dine.  I loved that I was able to make reservation on my app and we were seated right away and I get points!!  The girls ordered the pineapple cocktail which I'm told was crispy, fruity and delicious on a warmer night. I just can't eat pineapple like that. I settled for a red wine since they were out of the watermelon frozen rose or any of the frozen drinks that night. I must say the Quest (?) red blend was an excellent choice and I'm glad the waiter offered to let me sample a couple wines to get one I liked.    We all ordered the half chicken which came with tiger spice and a white bbq sauce. This was my first time experiencing a white bbq sauce and must say it was a flop. None of us like it as we couldn't get past the look of ranch but the taste for me didn't hit the mark for bbq sauce. However, the he tiger spicy sauce is . My only feedback is I wish it had a fresh out the grease hot fried temperature which it didn't. Very good though.  Sides: cornbread, green beans, grits and I tried the watermelon salad. All were worth it but the watermelon salad could have used some kind of acid or vinaigrette on the dry lettuce in the bowl. It really was just like eating 5 cook slices of watermelon and not sure if I'd get this again for the price.   Overall, perfect location, beautiful scenery inside and out, prime spot for people watching out to courtyard and moderate prices, solid portions. I like this location better than the Rim and the menu. I do think gumbo should be offered in both locations."

This is during their all day menu time, yet all they were offering was the very limited brunch menu that is an disappointment compared to the regular menu.  We triple checked the website and it still says the all day menu during this time.   I guess they are short staffed and cannot manage the whole menu. We were they decide to do this for a few days.

                "description": "We have always gone to Southerleigh the Saturday before Christmas - last year we almost walked out due to the attitude of the host - this year  we did .  Granted we booked for 6 but added one more - but as they were  already trying to squeeze 6 of us at a small table designed for 5 or less which is never comfortable and always too cramped , they refused however not in a polite or acceptable way.  I coupe have dealt with the inability to accommodate us and I get they have policies and we added one more BUT what I could nor deal with was the rude, condescending attitude of the host! She is one of that rudest people I have met on my life! Honey - you are a host - not a CEO!! Kindness and manners have are an asset that will get you far in life ! Within a seconds of us arriving she fired back with a rude, aggressive demeanor and even went after my kids! She did offer to sit us outside - in a storm.  Everyone should be treated equally and nicely and certainly not talked to like that by an hourly employee that thinks way too highly of herself.  She ruined a tradition that we have had for many years and as my husband and I both have taken many business associates here over the years and hosted corporate events - I highly doubt if I will be back as the customer service has been declining the last few years !  Even if they had a table - that's enough for me to walk!  So we went to the Boiler House that has table and people with a smile!"

                "description": "Southerleigh's Famous Pressure Fried Chicken | Ok... Ok... I have to start with this one dish because it was absolutely AMAZING! As I exclaimed to everyone around me at my table, THIS is the greatest dish of fried chicken I've ever had.. and I've had a LOT of chicken! I'd go back to San Antonio (and I'm currently trying to find an excuse to do so) just to take my girlfriend and try this chicken again. Fried to perfection, a light crisp around the brim of the chicken encapsulates the flavorfully juicy inner meat. PLUS - that combo sauce (tiger sauce) added on adds a nice n light kick to the already champion-of-a-dish. Highest recommendations - this is what made my night. A must-get.   Fried Frog Legs | Now, this appetizer stands out from the rest! It was my first time trying frog legs - and let me tell you... I'd try them again! Absolutely fantastic preparation for a unique dish. Thinking of trying them for the first time too? It's like perfectly-fried pieces of gator. The aioli included really adds another dimension to the flavor as well. Check this one out!   Wood Fired Pretzel | This app is to be as expected - a great wood fired Bavarian pretzel. Not my cup of tea, but if you're wanting some \"bread for the table,\" this can make do. I'd say go for some of the more unique flavors Southerleigh has instead - like the Frog Legs or Oysters!   East Coast Oysters | Wonderfully prepared - Southerleigh's Oyster prep goes a long way - long enough for me to actually forget my initially bad experience at another restaurant trying oysters for the first time. Love of oysters didn't happen to me at first sight - so this second encounter really had a positive impact. Highly recommend for oyster advocates and first time samplers!   Classic Meatloaf | A companion at my table ordered this dish - let me tell you, it's quite large.. be hungry and beware! He says it was rather good - but was jealous of my fried chicken.   Cracker Crusted Gulf Redfish | If you don't end up choosing the fried chicken I keep advocating for, then go with this dish right here. Southerleigh does a masterful job in frying their foods to perfection. With a light outer layer entry, you are taken on a deep-sea dive into the gulf of mexico with a flavor explosion from the adventure that is the Gold Redfish. Fantastic second place entrÃ©e in my opinion!   Beer | A majority of the brews they have to offer are brewed in-house which is pretty cool. They have a variety of quite unique flavors! Looking to try something different? The \"It's Just Red\" has a very unique flavor that I've never tried before. Let me tell you thought - half my table enjoyed it, half enjoyed just tasting it - but couldn't finish it. It has a fruity kick - almost sour if I recall correctly. I enjoyed the Gold Export Lager! It was very balanced and smooth and has that home-brew essence you may just be looking for.   With great and quick customer service for out large party, fun rustic ambience, delicious apps, historic foundations, and a brewery / top-notch bar, it should make sense as to why Southerleigh is an experience not to be missed. It's also located in the coolest part of town - the historic Pearl District! Fun tip: checkout the attached Pearl hotel - the rustic architecture and speak-easy steampunk vibe make it one of a kind. Check, check, check it out!"

                "description": "Walked into Hotel Emma and to the left is Southerleigh. My friend took us here as out of town visitors. Sat down as per our reservation and ordered deviled eggs to start and our drinks. Since we were at a brewery, I ordered beer. If you like sours, I recommend the \"Gimme Some Mora\". Tastes light for early drinking. Deviled eggs complement well with the sweet bacon jam.   One of us rarely has seafood so we made the bold move of ordering oysters and scallops to share, to expand her taste horizons! Scallops were a bit on the well-seasoned side for me but in small quantities, it was divine. Not overcooked so it was very plump. Oysters were also fresh and well shucked. Though not a seafood exactly, we also went for the southern delicacy of frog legs. I'm not familiar with the baseline of frog leg texture but we felt it tasted like a cross between chicken and fish, so an amphibian. We added a house salad to balance our meal.   The end but also the highlight of this lovely lunch is the fried chicken. The fried chicken was so juicy and deliciously amazing that I wish I could bring it back home. The skin is perfection! The provided sauces highlighted the foods rather than covering it's flavor."

Since my fries came out a wee bit later, they brought me the complimentary best macaroni and cheese ever. Ever. My little party of foodies and I enjoyed every bit of our stop here for a late lunch.

                "description": "I've been here a few times for brunch and it's definitely not a bad spot to hit up while at The Pearl. I got the Carolina Gold Rice Grits because I'm always tempted by browned butter and fried sage, but I will have to say that this particular dish didn't necessarily hit the flavor marks. The browned butter was more clarified, and the few bits of sage didn't have any standout flavor. The rice grits were truly rice and the entire dish lacked flavor: Crystal's hot sauce and salt and pepper to save the day. Egg was poached perfectly. I'm not bashing the dish in any sense, because I had high hopes for it, but it could've used some major flavoring. Maybe back to the drawing board with this one. Other than that, lovely restaurant, pleasant service."

The service has always be great. The 1/2 pound burger was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. It comes with a bacon jam that is fabulous. It makes the burger better.   The beer selection is very good. There is something for everyone. The beer selection changes often. If you are at Southerleigh's and they have Godzilla Go Juice available you must get it. It's a sake beer. The Eggnostic beer is excellent as well. Both are worth the money. This place is a must if you have not tried them."

Cold food, dry. Very bad experience.   Unfortunately, I had a bad experience with this restaurant. I've been here few times but this time was just the worst.

                "description": "3.5 stars  Service was a bit uneven. The building is beautifully restored - this restaurant is in an historic building which share space with the elegant Hotel Emma.  They didn't have much variety for fresh oysters at 5pm so we decided to skip those and did try the seafood salad...which is decent - a bit underdressed - so we asked for a side in addition...it really needed something else to perk it up. Perhaps more salt/acid/anchovy? Something not there...  For fun we ordered the antelope tartare which was oddly pretty satisfying. Very lean chopped meat on bottom with a drier version of chopped egg salad on top with a very nice complement of thin seedless pickled jaleopeno slices on top. Served with crackers. Definitely worth trying.   The fried chicken coming out of the kitchen looked delish but we didn't try it.  The Pearl Historic District where this is located is fun to wander around...there is a good farmer's market here on Sundays as well."

                "description": "I can't wait to go back to San Antonio soon just so I can come back to Southerleigh's. Especially for a landlocked city, their seafood selection was fantastic.  The decor is this beautiful steampunk-industrial style. Our group was seated in one of the booths overlooking the Pearl lawn - great view and very comfy seating! Our server was great - I don't remember his name, but he was extremely tall and gave us honest feedback about all the dishes and his personal recommendations, and he definitely didn't steer us wrong. I got the Peach Perfect to drink - the Tajin rim was the perfect contrast to the sweetness of the frozen peach. For my entree, I had the cracker crusted redfish - it was cooked to flaky perfection, and the generous pile of blue crab meat and lemon butter sauce added incredible flavor.   I have to give a special shout out to the HOUSE SALAD though - I normally have little to no expectations for starter salads when I eat out, but this one has completely elevated the bar for me forever. No joke, this is the best salad I've ever had - The black garlic ranch, crispy croutons, and sweet pickles are literally the best flavor combination of all time. It was so good, we ordered a second salad for the table. I've literally dreamt of eating this salad again and if/when I come back to Southerleighs, I'll probably just order two for myself and call it a day."

They have indoor and outdoor seating but I love sitting outside because I love seeing all the dogs that walk by especially on days with the farmer market going on.   I ordered the steak rancheros and my girlfriend got the waffle. For me, my eggs were cooked perfectly but my steak was just a bit over. The steak was seasoned well, the salsa had the right amount of acidity to go along with the eggs, steak, and potatoes to create the perfect bite.  They also have a wide selection of beers and you can get a full bottle order of champagne for your Sunday afternoon mimosas.   Their brunch menu is a bit limited for brunch and I am not sure if it changes seasonally but it is a great place to enjoy some brunch while taking in the vibes of The Pearl."

It has one of the best patios on the north side and they often had music on the weekends, although I can't be sure as of recent times because I have not been here on a weekend lately.  I absolutely love the wings, burgers and fries. They do offer some very unique items on the menu but I'm sad to say that I was disappointed when trying something different recently; namely the drunken mussels pasta. The description sounds amazing but in my humble opinion, it is spaghetti with mussels (still in their shells) in a very watery/brothy sauce with spices.  It seems like they are going for a Ramen type dish, but it was a big miss for me.  They were kind enough to exchange it for a burger though.  Highly recommend this place for ambiance, drinks and staple menu items."

This seems to be happening more and more with places that have the pay pads at the table verses letting you see an actual receipt and then making payment.   They made it right but good thing I looked at the receipt once home. *receipt is not emailed until about an hour after payment was made at venue."

                "description": "Hoppy Monk visit...  After a hiatus,  we thought Hoppy Monk would be a great spot for a small family gathering.  What a pleasant surprise to find a major improvement to the parking situation with a new under-cover structure, and probably double the parking the last time we visited.   That was big on our visit during Happy Hour on a Friday,  as their parking lot was packed!  We took our two Pups with us and immediately found a table on their spacious and well-appointed patio.   What a great feel Hoppy Monk has with all the groups, friends and families enjoying the great fall weather and Hoppy Monk's great craft food and drinks.  There were plenty of pleasant servers who looked like they were happy to be there.... in stark contrast to so many places these days.    Their drink menu is amazing with pages of craft beers and handcrafted cocktail options.  The Spirits section is several pages long. They have an actual drink and food menu just for \"Hoppy Hour\"! Their overall menu has continued to evolve and while we ended up just ordering a bunch of appetizers on our visit, I found 5 or 6 new menu items I've got to try.  Put it on my Holiday checklist.  Great to see Hoppy Monk doing well!  5+ Stars"

                "description": "Favorites were the gochujang cauliflower wings. My husband declared that this in the best cauliflower he's ever eaten. Brussels sprouts were also delicious. I couldn't get enough of that gochujang sauce so I ordered the actual chicken wings. I think I liked the cauliflower better because there was a lightness to it. Regardless, their gochujang is very concentrated, spicier and not as sweet as most places.  Rabbit tacos were cumin-y and tasty. I didn't expect to get that earthiness. The whole taco was just delightful. The elote fritters were also quite tasty according to our friend.  Wasn't a huge fan of the mushrooms, but the sauces (red pepper and walnut) definitely added some needed flair.  We had an awesome server and we also had leftovers!  Can't wait to dig in then come back for more  Se ate the leftovers and came back the next day.  The cheeseboard was delicious."

                "description": "Having visited their location in El Paso, I was very excited to be staying close to this location.  I still have daydreams of the Gochu wings and seemingly endless beer selection that I encountered previously. This location didn't let me down either: excellent personal service, good food and so much beer to choose from that if you set the glasses end to end they would circle the Earth 7 times. I might be exaggerating that last one. Yelp needs more hyperbole. Let's just say you have plenty to choose from.    This time I really branched out and went with the Gochu chicken sandwich. That sauce is as good as I remember, and I really like how they used whole boneless chicken thighs. Very good. Also good were the side of   Macha brussel sprouts. The light honey and almond touches really made these dynamite.    I won't go too much into the beer choices. Let's just say you're good. Get a flight and try a few. Your mom isn't watching. Unless you are having lunch with your mom. Just make sure she has a beer too so she won't give you that judgmental look and tell you again how you are drinking too much and why is it that you never finished college, and shouldn't you have children by now? God mom, just let me live my life!    I'm sorry, where was I? Oh, this is a good place. Go enjoy it."

                "description": "We have been here before, once before the pandemic for St. Patrick and live music, once earlier this year just for drinks and apps. The beer list is decent for San Antonio. We ordered the fish and chips, the Trappist mushrooms and Mac and cheese. The cheese sauce looked watery but I liked it. It's not a huge plate, so if you have an appetite get something with it. The batter on the mushrooms was excellent, very flavorful. This is a huge portion, definitely shareable. You get a choice of aioli: I got citrus and umami. I loved the umami, didn't care for the citrus.  If you like fish and chips, I would skip it here. The batter was bland. Even Tartar sauce wouldn't help. The fries might have been good, but they were cold by the time we got ketchup. Maybe they should use the batter from the mushrooms for the fish. As is the case at most places, they seemed short handed. The server was nice enough but over extended. And the folks running out his drinks kept taking them to the wrong tables. They may need to rethink their process there. I would have liked to try their duck tacos, but I guess they don't do this anymore. Parking is kind of wonky and the lot is kind of chewed up. It was seat yourself and there is outdoor as well as indoor seating. The outdoor tables can be pretty worn, but the inside is opened up, sitting nice weather, so that is a nice option."

There is an outside sitting area you pass through to get to one of the entries. It was relaxed, people were conversing, and the music wasn't too loud.  I took a seat inside and the architecture looked reminded of an old church house.  I ordered the Duchesse burger with fries.  The bun was soft and nothing like a burger bun. The meat was flavorful and juicy.  I would highly recommend getting a burger.  There was lots of beer selections as whiskey too if you are looking for a good craft beer selection."

They literally have like 5 pages on their drink menu because they have everything! And don't forget they also have really good food. Like delectable food, something when you go to a bar like setting the food is average, but this place - food is immaculate. Highly recommend the elite, they put the corn in a ball with cheese and some batter and somehow fry is so it comes out has a hushpuppy-like appetizer. Presentation is great! The other appetizer to try is the brussel sprouts. It's sweet, tangy, crunchy, and has a little kick. It's also topped with thinly sliced apples. It's really good, so be sure to order the full size for the table. They also have plenty of seating inside and outside. I went during lunch and there were lots of people. I also like the music they play here, super mellow easy going, and radiates positive vibes. Come one, come all - this place is a treat!"

My only issue was with the Ribeye sandwich. It was well put together but the steak had no flavor at all.. No seasoning and just a taste of oil. Couldn't even taste the aioli. Steak was tender and cooked medium rare though. Just disappointed about the lack of seasoning and flavor for the price.. I mean the sandwich came with no side and was $30 with the option for extra meat. Even if the sandwich was spot on that would be still on the very high side for a sandwich. I will definitely come back and give it another go. I do like most of what I had and the place is very nice and dog friendly as well.. Just that damn sandwich lol."

You can drink indoors or outdoors, at pease and just chill with or without your significant other, friends, or dog.    Also worth noting, this brewery participated in proving, clean, safe, drinking water during Snowmaggedon, even outside of their normal taproom hours.  The community appreciates it!"

Small, personable and fun.  The employees do a really good job suggesting beers that they have on tap.    I think I have mentioned a couple of times that I like dark beers, they have a number of stouts on tap and the Mint stout by far was the best.

                "description": "I hope when this reaches you Covid-19 would've been a fleeting memory. We all would be maskless carrying on with our lives as if nothing ever happened. However we don't live in Disneyland and instability is our new reality. Consistency is King, a currency few businesses  carry. Not only is this exhibited through its product but also by its service. As the pandemic wears on us the need to find meaningful experiences in the midst of chaos is increasing.  I will say I feel for the Black Laboratory Brewing  opening in the same year as the coronavirus continues to disrupt our lives. A lesser brewery would've surely folded. Instead they continue to consistently put out the city's finest craft products with service to match. Seeing their transition moving their sample beers from local businesses to flowing taps speaks volumes of their resiliency.  Before I write any further turning this into a  barrel aged review I should state what I liked about this brewery to include a few minor critiques. The taproom itself is in a small business co-op. Depending on the time of day you go parking can be limited. I've already gone on numerous occasions and their beers alongside their service is what keeps me coming back. Each time I have gone brewmasters are always willing to explain what's on tap with accompanying samples. The whole Black Lab team are extremely friendly, passionate and this reflects in every beer made.  For example I've tried their \"Black is Beautiful\" imperial stout up to my most recent visit with their \"Updog\", a triple ipa so potent it could take down an Imperial Snow-walker. If you're into lighter fare I've had their \"Grapefruit and Chill\" a  beer you need to drink with Jimmy Buffet blaring whilst rocking a Hawaiian tshirt. The diversity in their styles means there is something for everyone. Again consistency across the board seems to be the call of the day.    If I may add a few critiques it would be in available space and onsite taplists. Firstly it is a very small brewpub. As a result of the pandemic patrons are opting more to sit outdoors. This can be problematic. Since seating is shared with other businesses tables can fill up quickly. I've already had owners in adjoining spots give me the ojo. In addition on the each patio table is an online menu. Upon scanning it it takes you to their taplist via their website. In the future I hope they make a menu exclusively for when you visit as they rotate their list readily. While these are small critiques that are not dealbreakers, at least not to me. In the end consistent product and great service are really any place's calling card in these precarious times.   As a craft beer enthusiast, a patron of the world I know we have been on this long manic ride since March. We've seen iconic businesses that we would've never imagined closing are now leaving for good. The simple act of leaving our homes has new implications. The question that seems to not have a real answer: How do we support local businesses and still maintain best practices? I don't know. All I can tell you if you're looking for an oasis from these claustrophobic, home cocoon, anxiety-ridden and Zoom fatigue times please head out to the Black Lab for some liquid therapy.  ps. Don't forget to get a pizza from Truth Pizzeria next door to go with your beer! That way you get in your cardio workout."

You can get your beer here, a pizza from next door, and bazinga! The pizza seems a better option that the paninis that these guys are offering. They share a patio, which is dog friendly.  My only complaint about this brewery is that they didn't have a menu that you could take back to the table and pour over. They sent me to the one on the phone (mine was dead and needed charging) or go to the one pasted on the door. I opted for the one on the outside door, but had the hardest time reading it since people kept coming and going through the door while I was blocking it trying to read the menu. Derp.  They don't serve beer in glass here. Apparently they don't have the right kind of stuff yet to do so, so it's all in plastic cups, which seems kinda wasteful. The flights are served up in a bunch of tiny disposable plastic cups.  The beers I had were decent- especially the core beers that they seem to sell all the time. Bindi Blonde Ale was my fav, it's a good beer for drinking on their hot patio in the shade. I like that they also do some crazier, far out beers as well, such as minty or fruited milkshake IPAs. The service was fast and friendly, and you could tell that the ones pouring up the beer knew their stuff and were able to talk about what they were pouring articulately! I liked everything I had on the flight!"

It's completely touch free.  I can't wait until this craziness is over and I can sit and enjoy their beer with some pizza from a place that's in the same strip center.  My favorite beer so far is Jeff Jams v1.  So much flavor!"

Now that they are all allowing people into the taproom I decided to go down today to check them out. It is a very tiny place but there is an indoor and outdoor seating area which accommodates everybody who was there. The beer is fantastic! I am very critical of new places in San Antonio that brew beer at this place got it right. I had three beers and took an additional two 4packs home as well as two crowlers. I cannot recommend this place enough."

But the overall experience was not good. The service was unfriendly. And the ambiance was awful. Uninviting warehouse in derelict area between railroad and freeway overpass. Outdoor space is surrounded by barbed wire fence and you have to scream to be heard over the noise of the trains and traffic.  I just can't figure out why this place got so many 5 star reviews. Are San Antonian's standards that low? Are the other breweries so much worse than this one that this one seems nice by comparison?  I guess I'll never know"

                "description": "This review is for the BREWERY near SouthTown, NOT the restaurant on 1604.    The seating area is spacious but still gets packed by early afternoon on weekends.   Not only can you get the regular Freetail brews here, but they're also serving a handful of Ghost Pixel brews.  Ghost Pixel is a collaboration between Chaos By Design and Weathered Souls Brewing Company.  I'm not sure how they ended up in the Freetail Brewery, but hey, it'll give you a reason to head down there, enjoy some cold suds, and find the answer for yourself.  Brewery tours at 3p and 5p on Saturdays. You can purchase beer to go in 4 packs, 6 packs, and 22 oz bottles. Growler refills are $9 for the Freetail brands, $14 for the Ghost Pixel brands.  They offer some merchandise for sale, t-shirts, pint glasses, glass growlers, and river safe metal growlers.  Every 1st Saturday is comedy night and they usually have other events going on the other Saturdays of each month.   Another cool thing they do is bring in local businesses for events called \"pop-ups.\"  They brought in a local gourmet popcorn place called Pink's Popcorn a while back.  You could purchase a \"flight\" of various popcorn flavors and they were also giving away $5 gift cards to their stores.  There's a locally owned cupcake company scheduled for an upcoming pop-up, so get out there and check them out.  Check Freetail's website for their calendar of events for details on the Saturday events as well as the pop-ups.  TIP:  Drive slow if you have to park in the side parking lot.  It's gravel and there are a lot of potholes and ruts."

The dÃ©cor inside is almost festive, giving you the impression you are celebrating Halloween and Dia De Los Muertos, with wall art and mural art going from the floor all the way to the ceiling.

PARKING  Such a breeze!  The brewery has it's own large parking lot.  I don't think even a large party would push it over maximum lot-capacity.

They also offer the conserveza beer which part of the proceeds goes towards the SA zoos conservation efforts. They also offer topi Chico, sodas, (I think wine?!) for people who aren't big drinkers, they also offer chips and snacks. They usually have a food truck outside when we have gone. We usually come to Freetail when they're hosting an event. Our current favorite is \"hoppy endings\" comedy show which they host I believe every 3rd Saturday. They usually have a few comedians and it's FOR FREE. Be sure to check out Freetail for some good beer and events!"

All their note worthy store available beer plus all their other delicious ones are available on tap here. Clean restrooms and a/c available too (big plus for anyone really, right?). Inside they have a list of events for the month posted on the hand written board at the bar. Glasses and pints of beer range from $4-5/serving. Growlers and commemorative glasses/growlers available for purchase. No food made here which could be really great. Food trucks available outside so I'd bring a snack or eat before. Tables are long picnic style that make community style seating preferred. Bartenders are super friendly and are literally always smiling. Makes you feel really welcome.  Come and try Freetail and see where the magic happens!"

Free parking all over downtown, free beer samples (if you get there in time), free music, food trucks, and more beer. It is a good time within walking distance of a few other places to hop to after by either venturing into downtown proper or branching off toward Southtown. It is a free event, so really, what is there to lose?"

                "description": "Update to the update:   Flying Saucer is still one of my favorite spots in San Antonio for good beer, surprisingly good pub food, and excellent service.  I stopped in on a whim on a Friday afternoon. It's pretty dead but the regulars are here. Read my other reviews for more detail but I'll just sum it up.  Flying Saucer has good food. Their Rueben is probably the best version you're likely to get in San Antonio. It's seriously good (for San Antonio). Flying Saucer fries are ridiculously good. They're always crisp, never soggy. (Mine were on the edge of being too crisp today).  THEY STILL HAVE BELL'S OBERON ON TAP IN DECEMBER!!!!!!   For those who may not know. Bell's is a brewery in Michigan that has tentatively branched out to other areas. Flying Saucer (and similar places) sometimes gets it in the summer. It's a seasonal beer (spring/summer). Every Michigander knows the unofficial Spring kickoff is when Meijer's have stacks of Oberon on the shelves. So to find it still on tap in December is amazing. It's my favorite beer all time hands down. But don't y'all drink that ish cuz I'm coming back to kill it.  I sat at the bar and Ashely--the woman behind the bar--was great. Attentive but not over bearing. Perfect service."

Ordered their Smash Burger lunch special which in-essence was a burger on a wheat bun with two patties and fresh jalapeÃ±o.  It was served with a pesto mayo. The burger was better than I expected.   The waitress Rachel was fabulous and when she asked me which side I told her to pick her favorite. Arrived were seasoned waffle fries that were super hot and tasty.   This was one of the better lunches I had in awhile. I will definitely have to make it a priority to come back."

My friend and I were so excited to try this spot, there's always people on the patio and the vibe looked cool and welcoming. Unfortunately what we experienced was far from that. Our server seemed very annoyed with us right off the bat, they didn't have any of their specials... no happy hour... our drinks took forever and we were met with rolling eyes any time we asked for another one. The wings were foul... soggy... tasteless... and or course it came to the table with the wrong sauce but At this point we were just ready to leave. The rueben sandwich my friend had was salty, dry... gas station quality. Needless to say I have no strong urge to subject myself to that again, decide for yourself."

                "description": "We have been coming here for years and tonight's service was unfortunately subpar. This was our first trip back since before the pandemic and we were looking forward to catching up with friends at one of our favorite spots. Throughout the evening our server seemed short with us and couldn't wait for us to finish ordering before attempting to walk away. Waters were only half filled which was strange. They seemed  flustered with our group whenever we attempted to flag them down. They had a few other tables so perhaps they were overwhelmed. Only towards the end of our meal did the server ask if we needed anything else. On top of this my food came out late like they had forgotten about it (everyone else in my group got their food), and my burger was burnt. It took a long time for our server to return for me to tell her about it and I was hungry, so I cut the burger in half and ate around the burnt part. The fries were good. I asked the server about it being late and burnt and asked for a different burger that wasn't burnt. They said the manager already discounted it and that since I ate some of it, they couldn't discount it more than that nor did they offer to replace it. I appreciate the discount, however we wouldn't have known at all since a manager nor the server came over to tell us, and honestly I would have preferred a non burnt burger to a discounted one. We still tipped 20% on our bill because we know that service here is typically better than this. Perhaps this server was just having an off day. Hoping that our next visit is better!"

These things are all over the country now and they're very very popular with drinkers and pub food and pub quiz lovers. Basically they're sports bars with pretty decent food, notably much, much better than Buffalo Wild Wings - which isn't saying much.  They show a lot of sport and have some very challenging quizzes, and they all have very elaborate and extensive and interesting decor. For this reason I give it a high rating, and Barbie enjoyed our short stay here as did I.  Definitely one of the better sports bars and quiz/trivia pubs that we've been to lately."

Not only did we have a blast that would have made Alex Trebek proud, but we enjoyed some truly awesome brews with some decent food to keep them company :-)  Having spent a very enjoyable evening here, I'd come back again just for the trivia night, but even if I didn't like trivia their extensive selection of beers would bring me back for sure!  The prices were surprisingly reasonable, and the bartender was exceptionally friendly and very helpful assisting us decide on what to order.  Tip: While they offer a plethora of beers here, the food menu is fairly limited.  That said, I've tried both their Reuben and one of their burgers and enjoyed both very much.  My friend praised their pizza and their grilled cheese as well.  Flying Saucer is without question the best trivia pub/sports bar I've been to thus far in San Antonio and I look forward to returning!"

They were also very good with allowing you to try samples of the beer before you commit to one. You could also do flights which are great stepping points for you to figure out which beer you like. They have one for every palate! The soft pretzels with queso and spicy mustard were delicious! The spicy mustard was quite horseradish-forward, but if you dipped in both the queso and mustard, it was well-balanced. I definitely would come here again! There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (although outdoor is benches that aren't padded so if you want padding, sit indoors)."

Went inside and informed a server we were waiting for awhile, she let us know she would inform a server. We never had one server or managers come out. We ended up ordering from the bar and just taking it to our table. There was a server who came out and was serving all her coworkers who were getting off their shift. Not once, did she come and ask or talk to us. We were just one table away.   We have been coming here since 2019 and this was the first time we received extremely poor service.

I have love to watch them expand from a single room and 10 foot wide porch to the multiple building compound they have now. The beers are always delicious, the staff is always extremely friendly, and the addition of the new pizza kitchen is a huge plus.  Last time we were in, we ordered a build your own pizza that included a plethora of delicious meats and even topped it with truffle oil. If you are looking for a fun place to grab a delicious beer, listen to some live music, and eat some phenomenal food, this place that has it all."

We were hoping it would be a little cooler since it was by the bar inside the building but this is Texas after all.   We really enjoyed it and the burgers were so good. We did a flight of beer so we can taste a multitude of what they have to offer. The Peanut butter stout was amazing. The only complaint was the copious amount of flies swarming us, lol. We tried not to let them bother us but they were drawn to our food.   We probably would have stayed longer but the heat and flies got the best of us. We ended up going to a different place to day drink. I think it would be even better during the fall, winter, or the spring."

The beers taste fantastic, especially the bourbon infused one! The brewery also has live music and the band we listened to the night we were there was awesome! There is a second tasting room where you can get flights instead of full tapped beer-that area houses the main brewery area. There is also food at the Guadeloupe Pizza Kitchen which is off to the side of the brewery...the pizza we got that night was the Detroit style pizza, one was veggies and the other pepperoni and it was very tasty! This is a great spot to hangout with family and friends!"

                "description": "After a long day on the river we went in on a Friday being and I'll admit we were a little hangry. Everyplace in NB was packed out and GBC was no exception but it was for good reason, thankfully we didn't let our hunger or the crowd deter us because we would've missed our big time!   So they have two separate building you can order beer at, and a pizza building, pub fare building and taco shack all surroundings common outdoor seating area.  I will say the beer selection and quality was amazing, They had so many unique flavors full of body, light to dark and low ABVs all the way up to 15%! Im so thankfully they weren't 90% IPA which seems like the trend nowadays but truly had a large variety as selection to please everyone.  Their cider was perfect my tart and not sickly sweet like every cider is, super refreshing.  The food was no second fiddle either, and held its own not just against the beer but other rival restaurants with similar fare.  First of pricing is really good so you're not gonna break the bank. Also you get a ton of food for what you pay.  But the icing on top is that the food flavors are soooo good, we had the cheese curds, blue cheese burger from the pub food building at it was honestly one of the best burger ive ever had.  The pizzas were equally as wonderful and had some awesome combinations you don't normally scene but they have them down. We got the one with corrizo and it I think is one of my favorite pizzas now!   This place should be a regular watering hole for everyone! although it's outdoor seating the trees, canvas overhang and mister make it bearable and they really have an ambiance that make you wanna stay and hangout, especially with the live music in the garden patio setting.   As a suggestion/request I will as the business owners to blessed put up some fans! Not just for the heat but the stupid flies especially in the smoking section were super annoying!"

It was our first visit since they expanded and it's even better than before. Same great expansive beer options with a lot of new outside space. They also have a separate small batch only bar and overall, their prices are very good. It's also dog and kid friendly and all the people that work there are very friendly."

                "description": "Guadalupe brewing is one of our absolute favorites, and they keep expanding and somehogetting better and better. Amazing flavors and unique beers for every taste ranging from light pilsners to heavy stouts, hoppy IPAs or sour berlinerweiss. They have unique flavors such as dreamsicle, and If they advertise a flavor in a beer it'll definitely be a leading flavor and not slight hints! They have an outdoor seating area that is gorgeous, and an inside area as well. They also have two different bar areas to order from- and some beers are only at one bar and not the other, so check both before you choose! You can get reservations for a week in advance, so they're great for groups/special events. They also serve pizza which is so good! They offer normal or Detroit style, and is an absolute must!"

I had a simple pepperoni pizza and it was absolute perfection 10/10. Better than Via 313 in Austin, which I hold as the standard by which Detroit Style pizza should be measured. One pizza was enough for one person, and I really wanted to order and second but I resisted."

We've even slung beer for them on occasion to help out with events and goodwill.  From a \"closet\" with an outdoor grill on Friday nights, to a full dining and entertaining establishment,  Anna and Keith have never lost focus of their dream even all through Covid they have persevered.  The latest additions of a awning over the beer garden and customer laser engraved new tables to sit, three food choices including a new boffo pizza kitchen, you can't go wrong to stop in, relax and enjoy their hospitality.    Parents... there is a posting on the GBC website, please leave your minor children at home after 7pm. We don't see a lot of adherence to this request and this insults your hosts by being rude and reflects badly on you as a guest.  \"Prosit\""

First, a bit pricey on flights ($20 for 5 beers).  What really annoyed me today was we sat in the nonsmoking section and a worker (owner?) kept coming through with a really pungent cigar.  Multiple trips through and even lingered by us as he smoked.   Totally nullified my ability to taste the beers.  On the bright side, as well as awesome beers, the young man seating guests was super nice and attentive.  He even suggested we move to a cooler spot (the non smoking section haha).   Anyway, mixed experience.  Hence the 3 star rating."

                "description": "I had the privilege of attending Barrel Man Brewing's Grand Opening. There were a lot of people out supporting this brewery. It was pretty much busy the whole time I was there. The vibe was great. People laughing and having a good time enjoying their cold beers. It was a party.  The Head Brewer and Owner Fred was serving beers. Very attentive to every one. He was a machine. Serving the endless lines but still managing to engage people in friendly conversations with a smile on his face. I had several of his beers. All delicious in its own way, but my favorite was his \"SerenDIPAty\". At an ABV of 9.2  I think it drank more like a session IPA. It wasn't bitter or harsh like other double IPA's. It was smooth and very drinkable. I'm in no way a beer geek. But I felt like his beers were very good. I also tried their \"Islander Brat\". Let me say this brat really caught me off guard. The papaya slaw is everything. The garlic up front is really strong (in a good way). You'll definitely keep vampires at bay. It has a spicy kick to it and a nice texture. Combined with the brat and pretzel bun, that is brought in from a local bakery. This brat is the perfect pairing with their beer. I also liked that it came with chicharron instead of chips. To tie in their Filipino theme. Sorry no pic of the brat. I wasn't happy with the shot I took  Overall I love this brewery. Great beers, great staff, great food and a chill vibe to enjoy a nice cold beer.   I wish them all the success!"

They now have 4 of their own beers including two IPAs, a brown ale, and a golden ale, and guest taps to fill in the gaps including a cider. They offer a 12oz or 16oz pour for a very reasonable price. ($6 for 16oz IPA- amazing!). We tried both IPAs and they were both solid with a smooth finish. The bartender was friendly and quick getting our beers out. We already had dinner plans but we saw a few of the pretzels around the taproom and they look DELICIOUS. They're huge and you can tell they're buttered and salted. The taproom had lots of tables available and the back opened up to a back parking lot area for room to move around. This place is definitely pet and kid friendly. They had a really cool vibe with some 90s Rock playing (including tom petty). Definitely looking forward to watching this brewery grow and can't wait to come back to try more of their food/drink!"

                "description": "This place is a keeper y'all!  They have been around for 15 years now and 15 years in my book = perfection.  Why have I never heard of this place before???  We went on a Saturday night (I think, lol) and it just happened to be their 15th anniversary party.  Beer and drinks were cheap, and I heard a rumor that the drinks were pretty stiff.  They had Karaoke (of which I did not partake) and a side area with 3 or 4 pool tables.  There were 8-10 of us (I might have been seeing double, so don't quote me on that) and we were able to all sit together.  It did get busier as the night wore on, but it was not crowded at all.  It's a dive bar and I respect it for that, the only thing keeping them from five stars as a dive bar is that they only had two bartenders and only one bar back that occasionally showed up.  This meant we were standing in line for refills for a bit longer than we wanted.  They really were busy."

He is very friendly and has a wide variety of songs to choose from. If he doesn't have it he'll get it for you. Quinn on Wednesday and Saturday nights is also tops. They have a huge dance floor and stage so you can get your rockstar on. There is also pool tables and darts if karaoke isn't your thing. The bartenders here are awesome and know how to pour a drink. Especially Jess and Maggie. Also a shout out to the bar security, Ray. Best of all the drinks are cheap and they don't skimp on the booze."

So the drinks are always made with just the right balance of liquor to mixer ratio. The people here bond over karaoke like no other crowd I've seen.  Ask for Jess when looking for a bartendar who knows how to take care of her clients. Also both Eddie and Quinn are very professional and some of the best KJ'S I've met that know how to balance your vocals and make you look like the next American idol. This place has gone above and beyond my expectations everytime."

I had a hard time staying here, I don't like my back to the door. It does have tables and chairs that you can move around.When we walked in people were smoking right at front door. I had to walk through smoke to get into the bar. It is centrally located.which is very convenient if you're picking up food or going shopping and just need a break. I did not stay long because of my own personal preferences. No one did anything wrong. Check it out ."

                "description": "Very sad time last night. I am a frequenting customer and I decided this one time to take one of my girlfriends out to my \"drinking spot\". We got there at 1am, ordered our drinks and received the WORST customer service of my life. Not going to lie, most of the time it seems like the bartenders were hired from a \"wanted ad\" on craigslist but this particular girl just took the cake.   She was asian, wore heavy eyeliner and a Tshirt that said PINK on it. Rolled her eyes everytime my friend ordered a drink because she was busy talking to the same group of people. at 1:45 she pointed at her from over the bar with a disgusted face and said \"You better finish that, were closing at 2\" im sure there is a much better way to say that and a lot nicer. My friend, playfully goes, \"aw we just got here.\" Smile on her face, bartender scoffs and goes, \"Not my problem you got here too late.\" Seriously what is that girls problem!?   My friend stood up at one point to fix her dress, again the bartender yells \"Hey you cant take that outside, you have to finish that here now.\" My friend replies, still pleasantly despite this girls attitude, \"I know I will.\"   SHE ROLLS HER EYES and says \"Or whatever, just act like im stupid\" Im at this point inclined to agree that you did in fact hire a stupid bartender.  These are just a couple of aggressive comments that your bartender shot my friends way unprovoked. And now im sad to say I will NOT be returning to your establishment. I will NOT recommend this place to anyone, in fact I will be avidly turning people away from it.   I honestly have no idea what that girls problem with my friend was, and this is not a drunk post. I was the Designated Driver and didnt drink anything, so I know what im talking about.  All in all, you hire terrible bartenders that drive away customers because of there own personal issues. You just lost a lot of business within an hour, congrats.  PS: I want the manager to contact me. I want to know why you hire someone like that."

Alison and I stumbled across this place toward the end of a date night after having visited some other bars in the general area of town.  This one took the prize and we wish we would've just started out here to begin with.  Cheap drinks, TV's with sports and SNL. And, we were there on a Saturday, the aforementioned karaoke.  Get your name in early as the crowd really likes to sing here. I recommend just taking cash as they had some difficulty, for whatever reason, with their credit card processing."

I assure you that I don't have an account for either. I have gone to their brewpub a couple of times. I've tried several of their beers at various places(Gooberverse series- Kanye Zest etc.). And I recently utilized toast tab to score their highly publicized beer, \"Rojo.\" So why am I going against popular opinion? Am I being a contrarian? Difficult? I will tell you there will be times on Yelp when you're on the fence about a place but cumulative experiences always tips the scales.  I remember before Islla even opened trying their Pineapple Empanada IPA at a local festival. It was hands down the best beer I had at that event. I really appreciated their ethos of blending cultural roots with creative takes on craft standards. Unfortunately for me that is where my affinity for them ends. Firstly I went to what was supposedly to be a soft opening. But a misprint by a local zine turned this event into a full out grand opening. Needless to say it was a perfect storm of circumstances: crazy crowds, unavailable styles, lukewarm beer to include service.  To be fair to them I understand they must of been taken by surprise. Which I assume included going back to the drawing board to regroup. I decided to reserve my review contingent on a future visit.  So I waited a few months to allow the crowds to dissipate. The next time I went the place was empty. When it is not crowded this is the most optimal time for a brewery to make a connection with the patron via tapmaster. Instead the dude seemed like, \"Whatever.\" No, \"Is this this your first time here?\" Or \"Are you looking for a specific style?\" I ordered the Suavecito 37 dressed with cajeta on the glass's rim. In all honesty I was a bit confused. The only time I have any one dressed is with a Corona and I try not to resort to that. Subsiding the beer this experience was less desirable than the first. The vibe was very unwelcoming. A brewery should create the feeling of being at a second home. No one traverses across town only to chug a beer wanting to leave.  Again I have to tread lightly not to go into Ratebeerland. The pivotal experience for me was an online purchase made on their toasttab account.  I was hoping to score the second batch of the Rojo made with Big Red soda. So an order was placed. I got a Saturday pick up time and date. I was ecstatic as it sold out in minutes. A few days later they posted a letter online saying that a glitch in the computer sold inventory meant for future release dates. The only recourse according to them was to divvy  pick up times into three waves. Surely my given Saturday date( first day of the relaunch) meant I would still get a late pickup or at the least be included in the second wave. Wrong.  Much to my chagrin I was not even given a second wave spot but relegated to third. Which meant an almost three week wait. I began to wonder how did they determine cutoffs? If the amount sold was in the hundreds why didn't they just do purchases in a first come first serve format? My conspiracy theorist brain went into overdrive. Did they pull the names of favorite regulars and place them in the first two slots? Was inventory even ready for pickup? If it was why didn't they just distribute orders throughout the week? Computer error on your part is still your part. It's best business practice to at least attempt to fix a mistake.    My experiences at Islla Street Brewing Co. have thus far been a series of unfortunate events. Even as a professed misanthrope I try to remain optimistic. However one of my biggest Yelp pet peeves is a business that doesn't attempt to make things right. To me this should be included in a business's mission statement. It shouldn't be, \" Too bad so sad.\"  Now I will segue into my craft beer enthusiast mode. Ok so here's what I think of their, nevermind. When you get past the chest thumping, gimmicky, inconsistent beers to include poor customer service all you really have is hype. And that's helpful to sell a beer but that alone can't sustain a brewery.  ps. In the Immortal Words of the Greek Philopsopher Flavor Flav- \"Don't Believe The HYPE!\""

                "description": "What a gem! Recommended by a fellow Yeeper [Yelp Elite], I am so happy to have found Islla Street Brewing. :D Such a chill spot and friendly folks. Smallish space with several tables and streaming music.   They're producing some of the very best micro craft beers; nothing like you will find anywhere else. Just check out the menu [see pic]. Islla's mission is to create beers that reflect their heritage and culture. They bring in ingredients that elevate and highlight each batch. Where else are you going to get Strawberry or Pineapple Empanada DIPAs or one brewed with real pink Concha pan dulce? Off the charts! And they use garnishes with some that really stimulate the palate.  Islla's interesting brews might seem a bit kitchy to some; however, as a certified beer nerd who has visited well over 100 breweries I can tell you there is a LOT of skill involved in their processes and the results are outstanding IMHO. Simply put: well-balanced, none to sweet, tart, or bitter...scarily crushable suds.   On your first visit I suggest sharing a couple of flights. Be sure to try the Suavecito '37 (grandpa's nickname) if it's available - a super tasty brown ale with toasted coconut, coriander, and Mexican caramel. Mmm. Cheers!  Note: During my visit, their was a Taco Truck on-site that was bomb!"

                "description": "This place is dangerous. Their beers are easily drank and supper smooth.  Unique in taste (seeing at the ingredients they use to brew their beers i.e. nopalitos and guava), their beers are true South Texas and nothing but solid.   You just can't beat their vibe. Their space is really unassuming but comfortable.  It's like walking into your friend's garage during a barbecue with Selena jamming on the boom box.  This is a San Antonio institution that you should take your friend's, family and out of towners to."

Islla St. Brewing ,however, just had to make that a huge and really difficult challenge.  I drove here at the spur of a moment just to try that much talked about Big Rojo beer.  Then some girl asked me for an order number.  I had no clue what she was talking about.  I just wanted to buy some damn beer.  Then she told me I had to place an order online.  I was immediately disappointed, said to myself \"Fuck this!\" and quickly drove away.  Never again.  Not a good way of developing good customer relations...tsk...tsk."

Islla Street may be new, but they've already become my favorite San Antonio beer... soooo freakin' GOOD!!  The beers are all awesome twists on standard styles - IPAs made with fruit empanadas. Stouts brewed with conchas or horchata and flan - and *consistently* delicious. The family ties just make them even better.  They do have flights (YAY!!), but currently don't have any to-go options like growlers or crowlers - on-site only.  Dog friendly. *Awesome* music (sometimes just a smidge louder than I'd like though) - my favorite is when the playlist (from the iJukebox) is filled with mariachi-meets-pop/rock/metal mashups haha). Usually a fantastic food truck posted up waiting to provide the snack action.  Don't hesitate - go visit! Cheers!"

Finally got my hands on their Rojo beer and let me tell you.  The beer tasted like big red and Lonestar light had a child out of wedlock and named it diabetes.  I poured most of it out, for it to be so hyped doesn't surprise me, San Antonio has bad taste I mean joes volcano stayed open 20 years and that shit sucked too."

I love that they add extra touches like caramel or tamarindo on the rim. My favorite was the suavecito. The coconut flavor stood out. They also have sangria. Sangria is good, but give their beers a try first. You may just be surprised. Even if you don't like beer, you may just enjoy one of theirs. Definitely get a flight.   The area is small with only a handful of tables and the bar area,  but we didn't have trouble finding a seat even with the place full.  The night we went, they had a DJ playing tejano music. They also had a food truck parked outside.   I will definitely return..... I only wish they were closer to home, but they are worth the drive"

HeMango being our fave, and I ended up preferring their Chola blonde by the time our visit was over.  One other random thing I liked was the restroom..  ik it's silly but they had chongos and Bobby pins to pick up my hair (it's hot out here y'all) super dope of them. We even met a few people and chatted, super chill environment, everyone was just drinking good beer and relaxing. All in all an enjoyable experience. We'll be back."

However,  I was fortunate enough to have a recently transplanted friend come pick me up for a quick catch up.  Big Hops is one of those spots where there's not just a lot of beers on tap but they're well (and I hate to use this term) curated. I'd been to more than a few spots in my first short stay in Texas and there was a BUNCH of good beers on hand. I had already had had a few earlier in the day and the beers here were not only one I hadn't come across but damn tasty.  Now, a lot of beer nerd type places can be condescending, especially if you're not up on regional breweries or what's pouring. Our bartender, David was super laid back and let us try a bunch of beers but also was someone you could talk to about beers.  We showed up pretty close to closing time but he let us stay-it was his birthday and his gf showed up with food and he was in no rush to leave/throw anyone out. We ended up buying him some birthday beers. I need to head back on my next trip."

Big Hops has such good stuff on craft front that it makes me wish I loved beer more. This is a beer bar without pretension, a fun place to hang out with friends, and an even better spot to enjoy a quality pint.  They have something like 30 taps that rotate with seasonal stuff happening throughout the year. Their happy hours (typically 3-7pm on the latter half of the week). Sample as many beers as you can and definitely take the bartender's suggestions if any. The last time I was here, the bartender was celebrating a birthday and we ended up staying past closing time.  The vibe is laid back and there's decent seating for various groups from bench style seating and small'ish tables. I prefer sitting at the bar and bantering with the bartender. I particularly enjoy their sours, flavored IPAs (peach and/or grapefruit especially), saison. It's one of those places where I'll try anything the bartender is willing to give.  Prices are solid and they accept credit cards. Given how hot San Antonio's weather has been as of late, the thought of drinking a nice cold brew suddenly sounds really great."

So what seems to be a $3 beer Is actually $7-$8 with the glass included. IF you miss this - you will be VERY surprised by your bill at the end of the night.  Storytime:  I got charged an extra beer I didn't order. I talked to the server about it and he was not seeming to understand what I was talking about. Got a little impatient with me and could tell he was getting frustrated. Thankfully he put me with the manager and we got everything squared away. Instead of taking it off of my bill he offered me a free beer on my next visit. Eventually I'll cash in my beer.  The manager handled the situation with such poise and understanding.   This place has a private lot with indoor and outdoor seating. Check it out and be mindful of the prices!"

They frequently rotate out their tap selection so you can normally find some thing new and to your liking. Good selection of all types of beer, some from local breweries and some from across Texas. We enjoy the outside patio as there are  a couple of picnic benches with umbrellas. The shopping  center itself has music playing and it's always soothing. The inside is just a few picnic benches and a little to dark inside for my tastes, so we normally sit outside. This girl is solar powered!

If you order 1000 Degrees pizza next door, they'll even come by and bring it to your table.  What's not to like about beer, pizza, sports on tv, and a chill environment? Whether it be a random weekday, a Friday night, or a weekend. This place is hands down my favorite brewery in SA!"

                "description": "The quintessential after work bar. I've spent time here after brutal Mondays, stressful Wednesdays when I thought the week would never end, and celebratory Fridays.   Don't get too attached to a beer on their menu. They rotate frequently, which is cool, because it forces you to try something new with almost every visit. The staff is friendly and works hard to get you served in a timely manner.  The tables are graffitied to hell and back, which gives the space interesting character, and this is the only bar in town that I know of that plays The Growlers and The Allah-Las without a patron using an internet jukebox. That alone makes this spot worth coming back to. (That and it's walking distance from work and right next to a pizza shop)  Stick around on Wednesday nights for pub trivia, and swing by during a holiday or special event--you might score a free glass to take home."

They have a free bingo game you can play to win tickets for the San Antonio beer festival and other prizes. Prices range from $5.50 to $18 depending on what size you get. I heard you can order food from next door and they will deliver it to you. They have reverse happy hour from 10p to close. Nice bartender."

I truly enjoy grabbing a copy of the SA Current by the door, ordering a 9% IPA and sitting down with my love while sipping some of SA's finest craft beer. There's TV's overhead for sports games and next door there's a jimmy john's if you are feeling hungry afterwards and the newest build-your-own pizza place 1000 degrees. The restrooms are very clean and probably the cleanest I've seen at any bar honestly, because they are SPOTLESS. If you want to feel some of SA's rare wind take a seat outside on the back tables in the patio area. Cheers!"

                "description": "Have been trying to find more IPA and craft beer focused places around town, getting into beer tasting as of lately so I thought I would start here; When I arrived, the Huebner location was very cozy and small, just my kinda bar! The vibe was very chill and laid back, the lighting was very relaxing, not too bright but enough to see the entire bar. The bartender I dealt with was very friendly and attentive, at first I was picking random things from the menu, but then I requested his recommendations since I know very little about IPA's; he was very informative and looked like he enjoyed his job (big points).   The place was very clean and tidy, the layout to sit was unique, I chose to sit by the window on a bar stool as to not take up a table that could sit people with more than one guest. The place does fill up very quickly on a busy night such as watching the game, or the night I went was apparently trivia night so people came in and the seats filled up fast. It's a shoe box size kind of location with good size tv's and a sound system, they even have a deck out back to enjoy the weather which I loved.   The beer selection was very diverse and it's something to periodically come back and check was new beers are on the rotation, the price wasn't bad at all either for the kind of beers they were serving.   Took one star away due to the trivia night people turning off the television while I was watching it, and proceeded to act like I didn't even exist, I was watching the Spurs game and having a good time; then they proceeded to set up their equipment around me where I was sitting as if I didn't even exist. I found it completely rude and even tried acknowledging them since the game was only in the 2nd quarter, but they completely blew me off. So just a fair warning about the trivia night people.   Other than that, I would def come back again but NOT on trivia night."

If this kind of moment is something you'd like to avoid, I've found the website is up-to-date, that way you can make your decision before leaving home, and be cool and confident when you walk in. This is a small bar serving beer-only with about a zillion options to choose from everyday. The place is simple enough: L shaped bar, 6 or 7 tables around that, and a few TVs with one showing everything on tap that day. There's a patio somewhere past the rest rooms, but I haven't ever made it back there. And that's about it. If you're into beer what else could you ask for? The vibe is grungy. Corrugated metal, stickers on the walls, and scruffy beards are everywhere.Â Â Your flannel jacket and your stained t-shirt are equally appropriate. It's casual. Bring food if you're hungry. You can also stumble down the sidewalk and bring something back. There is a lot to choose from nearby."

Find one you like and want to take home? They've got growlers for that!   I recommend gulping down an Brash Abide  white Russian Milk Stout. This beer goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. It is the White Russian of beers, and I seriously can't get enough! I also tried the Pineapple Thai Basil by Collective Brewing Company. The name in itself made me curious and I just had to try it. I mean, basil, in a beer! It's a sour beer, which I normally steer clear of, but the flavor in this brew intrigued my tastebuds.  If you like something, get it before it's gone! The greats don't last long!"

First, the BH is located in some random shopping center off huebner in the back. Kind of out of the way but not really. It's a really small space with limited seating--several benches, bar seating, and a small outdoor area in the back.   It's a cool first date type place because it's usually not too loud and, depending on when you go, not usually too crowded. I went on May 4th and they were tapping a special keg w/ glass and it got super packed--like uncomfortably so--but I think that was just because it was a special occasion.   They have a variety of beers on a rotating tap--plenty of Texas beers--and others from around the way. This season they have Bells on tap so I have been spending some time there. I love all Bells beer, especially Oberon, their spring/summer beer.  Um prices are on par with other craft beer places. That's about it I guess. Check them out if you're in the area."

After asking twice, I went and got the cleaning supplies myself to clean the food and spilled drinks off the table. Really, it should have been done right after bussing it.  Our pretzels came out luke warm but edible. We were not given any utinsels / napkins at the check out or when the food was brought. It seemed like the beers and ciders were much more limited than a couple months ago.  As for food, I ordered the fish tacos, which I have had before. This time they were mainly slaw with a few tiny pieces of fish.   We also ordered the pork chop but after ordering and paying we were advised that they were out. We subbed in the burger which was okay but nothing special.  Getting flimsy plastic fork and knife instead of real silverware (or decent quality plastic) was a bit of a challenge for cutting the burger, I can only imagine how it would have been with the pork chop.   We will be back, but are in no hurry.   We appreciate that they are dog friendly, so an extra point for that."

For that reason I am giving their food a complete pass on this review. It took awhile and came out cold, BUT I could tell it was high quality and I will be trying it again on a much less festive occasion. Their beer is quality stuff. I tried their seasonal Pumpkin Spice IPA along with another of their usual IPA's and I came away impressed. The one thing is, and again it was very busy, their beer menu chalkboard was a little chaotic and hard to follow. I would highly recommend Cibolo, and I am looking forward to trying it again. A good experience with the food and a little more time to read the menu could easily change this review to a 5 star spot."

It's seat yourself and order at the bar. We sat out back (quiet without traffic) with our pup. The beers are SO delicious and made so well!! The Blonde has a German spin to it. We had the pretzels for an appetizer and wow the flavors of the cheese dip and mustard (kinda spicy mustard and I hate mustard but it was good). My husband ordered the friend chicken biscuits and gravy. Amazing!! More like a chipotle gravy and thick and sooo filling and rich! We was in Heaven!   I had the Chicken Fried Chicken on a potato bun- I am not a friend chicken person (maybe 1x a year), and I got it with the jalapeÃ±o lime wing sauce. Holy hell! Just spicy enough (not too much) but perfect! So filling and amazing and the fries had a homemade vinegary ketchup with them. Get this! Awesome! It started getting crowded with a lot of kids, but deff go early if that's not your thing. Awesome service and no tipping allowed!"

There is plenty of seating inside in the AC but also outside,    for the beverages  I chose  the  Boerne Blonde  and then an October Fest , the entree I ate was chicken fried chicken sandwich it was amazing, obviously hand breaded and fried on a homemade bun with fresh cut fries, one additional tasty treat was the house ketchup with a touch of star anise. The chicken was moist, the bun extra flavorful..... the homemade fries are on point too, my wife ate the Meze plate, it consisted of the best hummus,  marinated feta, tomato carrots, and cucumbers, olives and pita bread with a drizzle of a balsamic glaze..... everything was perfect if you are looking for a destination date spot to make a great impression this is the place  Look I'm telling you to try this place and you will be hooked like the rest of us dont forget to tell them jimmy sent you!"

This is our second time here but our first time eating dinner. We loved every bite I don't know what's in the ketchup but I really liked it too. The chicken sandwich was great and tasty and you get plenty of fries. My wife ordered the chicken salad sliders and she said those were some of the best she's tasted. I gave them a try too and I agree. They have plenty of beer and wine to choose from too.   Seating outside front and in the back!! Pick your favorite spot and throw your feet up and relax. We love coming here and also grabbing a loaf of bread at the bear moon bakery down the street!!   Social distancing enforced so don't worry!!"

                "description": "Not a bad place to try some \"home brew\" tasting beer and burgers on rolls. The place is clean, the people are very friendly. It's a kid friendly family environment, not a place to act up and cut loose for sure. Limited parallel parking along a busy street. 85.00 for 3 burgers and 4 beers. No tipping allowed because the staff is paid a living wage, a plus for sure.  Tried 4 beers, Blonde, October fest, whisky sour and the IPA and all have the home brew unfiltered thick grainy after taste but they are decent, as good as my home brew at least.   Major draw back is the food and drink ordering is at the bar so getting another beer is a long wait.  As patrons take their time studying the menu while others stand in line for a refill time can be passed by conversation with the locals or admiring art for sale on the wall, it doesn't seem to bother anyone and I didn't mind but I wouldn't make this my regular place for this reason, I recommend a dedicated bartender for alcohol only and food orders could do both.   FYI everyone is nice here"

My friends got the blueberry lemonade and it tasted weird and not sweet enough.  3. My friend got the chicken sandwich and it had absolutely no flavoring and seemed to be more batter and crust than actual chicken.  4. I got the wings and fries. My fries came 10 min before my food... so I had to send them back when my food came.  5. The wings were so tiny  it was actually funny how small they were lol.  6. The ranch was the most redeeming thing about this place!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RANCH YUM YUM YUM!  7. Our server was also very very nice and helpful.  Overall this place was disappointing :((("

Got the enchiladas,  flavor of meat was good but tortillas were hard and there was a solid cup of sour cream drizzled on top. Rice beans very bland but cooked correctly. Husband got the chicken sandwich , was tender but needed a sauce with flavor fries needed salt but none to be found. Service , it's walk up ordering at the bar area. Tips are included in the price of food which is cool but unusual. We asked for silver ware and got one setting. We told the bartender we wanted to pay cash , but he still asked for a card and ran the tab as credit. Super odd. Seems like the locals get the concept. I went for pretzels and brisket fries. Both were not available. A lot of the reviews are pre covid. All the servers were polite and food came quickly. Average at best ....."

The place has a menu that changes regularly and old favorites to keep you coming back. My favorite are the deluxe tots with the over easy egg on top.  They also have a great Happy Hour that you can check out on Facebook.  I highly recommend their frozen Margaritas too.    The place has ample parking and there are a lot of cool local shops in the same area, like a plant shop. There is also great indoor/outdoor seating.  You place your food and drink orders at the bar and pickup your food outside when your buzzer goes off. Also, huge plus is that it is pet friendly."

Margaritas are not my first pick but my nephew recommended them, they were too strong to enjoy the taste.  It was a busy night and our first time there as well, we walked up to a long line to place our orders. When we finally reached the front the bartender looked and sounded a little frustrated. Her customer service can use a little refreshing.  Be careful when placing your order there is a tree root sticking out which tripped many people including myself. Overall I would return solely for the food not so much their drinks"

Our second round included frozen margaritas - my personal favorite was the prickly pear, though the mango was enjoyable as well.   The menu was short and sweet, but the Korean bbq wings were spicy and delicious, and the fries were exceptionally crispy and hot. I was impressed.  Great atmosphere and crowd in the evening, and a band was playing live music all throughout. It was a bit loud for my taste, but still possible to hold a conversation. Would definitely return again!"

I've been there on both Saturday and Sunday afternoons and we've never had an issue getting a table (although as the weather gets hotter, finding a table in the shade might get tougher!)"

We saw Burleson, which somehow I thought it was so much further out.  It's across the street!!  When we got there, we were welcomed with a friendly smile.  I got a chamoy margarita which was delicious. It hit the spot after walking in the sun.  We ate there and I got the burger, it was great! My husband got the chicken sandwich and he said it was the best!  Great place to hang out at. I enjoyed my time there. I almost catnapped a grey kitty that was roaming around.  It was such a nice find! Glad we finally got to visit!"

                "description": "This is my updated review of Burleson. My husband and I went there on Friday night and the vibe was awesome. There was a great DJ playing excellent music. I had 2 Sky Trooper IPAs and I loved it. And I had my first burger there and it was FREAKING DELISH. It was char-grilled perfection. The bun was also char-grilled to perfection. It is a thin patty and the fixings are simple, lettuce, tomato, onion I think, mustard, and maybe pickles. It was a classic American burger. No frills, just thrills.   Then I thought about this burger every day since and we decided to go there today and bring the whole family. It was a Monday and I have been told to never go out to eat on a Monday b/c the regular chef/kitchen staff are not on duty. But who knows if that is even true or not.  Anyway.....I ordered 2 BURGERS for myself. That is how good I thought they were. And before I forget, the FRIES are the BOMB!!!!  I had my first bite of this Monday afternoon burger and I have to say I was disappointed. The bun was barely toasted and the char-grilled flavor was not as significant. The bun I could tell was a wee bit old and a wee bit dry. I was sad. The burger wasn't bad but it wasn't the burger I had on Friday night which was SUPER CRAZY AWESOME. What happened Burleson?   I still love your vibe and I will still make this my happy place for sure and I am hoping this was a fluke.   And another really cool thing I have to share from our Monday visit is that their coke was running a bit weak so the bartender brought us bottled cokes instead and didn't charge us extra. We didn't even ask for this nor did we complain about the soda he just noticed and brought them to us of his own volition. The staff is so nice here and I LOVE the place.  People are always having a great time here. You can bring the dog, the fam, or friends and just chillax yourself.  Please take care of that burger."

We ordered margaritas which were fine and we ordered  one order of deluxe fries and deluxe tots and let me say they ain't nothing deluxe about em! It's fries or tots with basically pick de Gallo on it and jalapeÃ±os. I read it had bacon and melted cheese! Which it did have melted cheese but just the shredded cheese. They give you a side of ranch or ketchup â€ those are not sides to go with this chilli would have been better. The cashier was sweet but failed to tell me that we pick up our food outside not inside at the bar and that a number for our order was on our receipt. We waited for a little while before I had to ask and when I did I mentioned I didn't know that. That should've been the first thing she mentioned to me. Other than the mis communication it's an ok place. Kinda small for a beer garden. Seating isn't bad and parking isn't bad either."

There is indoor seating with plenty of televisions to enjoy sports and the bar opens up to the patio area. It was definitely an enjoyable experience the FIRST time. Tonight, however, different!  When we decided to come here we hadn't looked at the hours and got here about 11:20 pm. They close at midnight. No big deal. The ALCS game is in extra innings tonight and the one bartender couldn't be more upset that this is interfering with his close time. The entire time we have been here he has been complaining about the people in here and how this game and people walking in are interfering with him going home. I definitely get it, but it is not good for business.   This is definitely worth a try, but don't you dare come in close to closing!"

                "description": "The unintended effect of transplants coming to San Antonio cannot be discounted. Areas a generation that seemed overlooked are coming alive. Thus the same warehouse in the Westside that houses \"Shotgun Coffee Roasters\"  becomes an intermediary. A coffeehouse, a brewery in the Westside? Say it isn't so but at least for now our city is experiencing a renaissance of sorts . As a result more unique businesses are hedging their bets, opening up  in our city. Which brings me to the Vista Brewing Company.   I could go on, using flowery verbage to describe my experience here but why. So I will give you the rundown. Parking is very problematic. You can park in residential areas but be careful. Vehicles come down the street and like Sammy Hagar \"They can't drive 55!\" It's housed in the same building as \"Shotgun Coffee Roasters\" an excellent coffeehouse by the way. It is really small with some indoor seating with more outdoors. So basically you go to the counter and order your pour. The taplist while a bit limited has something for everyone. I settled on their \"Middle Trinity\" a Belgian Tripel. I would remiss if I didn't comment on the tapmasters as they are friendly.  My understanding is that this is their third location the other two being: Beecave and Driftwood. While they don't serve food in the foreseeable future they will have rotating foodtrucks. I must admit the beer I had was not too bad. It was much more sweeter, boozier than I anticpated. So sitting here I did have a critique. Since this area is close by an open ravine there appeared to be an insect issue. I was bit a few times and shooed off mosquitoes whilst drinking my beer. I hope they consider bringing in a pest controller periodically.  Still I recommend coming here. It is a unique addition to this area. A brewery in the Westside? I never thought I would imagine seeing one here in my lifetime. The Vista Brewing Company is a charming place with good beers and service to match. Will patrons  that never frequent this area venture outside their comfort zone to come here? I don't know. Time will tell. Next time I come I'm drinking inside."

Great spot, - the converted warehouse it's in is very cool and outdoor area was nice. Beers were light and crisp. I had the American Pale Ale and  the weizen and would recommend both (nice day-drinking beers ). I do not typically like wheat beers because I find them too heavy, but theirs was light but full of flavor.  Looking forward to visiting again soon."

Not only are the beer connoisseur knowledgeable but the have a great sense of humor and easy going. I never feel rushed and they give great descriptions of the brews.   I chose their flight which is $9 for 4 options. I chose mostly IPAs but not sure what the exact ones I tried but everything was so good and I've been several times after this they always have opportunities to grab a free glassware with purchase of beer of course!   The location is so convenient and I love their beer options. I will be going here any chance I get to get my IPA fix and to try some new options!"

We the only customers in there, but I bet once word gets out it will be very busy. Daniel and Maryla (?) were exceptional and great customer service!!! We will definitely be back because of them. I had a Austin Eastcider Blood Orange and my friend stuck to the IPA route.  Everything was reasonable priced, and in the future they are supposed weekly specials.

                "description": "Epic location, epic draft beer selection.  Come for the beer and stay for the views! They have an epic selection of local beer on tap (see photo). We came for lunch and I had to sample some San Antonio brews.  Ended up trying the Honey Blonde ale and Nitro Pecan Porter. Both are worthy of repeating. For food, we started with Miguel's Queso (creamy with a kick, definitely cheese-forward). Then we shared a plate of vampire tacos and the chicken avocado sandwich.  The sandwich was just OK, but the tacos were excellent! Soft flour tortillas coated in cheese and fried to a crisp... What's not to love??!  Would come back after dark for views of the river walk."

                "description": "Very disappointed with our experience here at the Yard House.   Our server was all over it one minute then she would disappear and you wouldn't see her again for ages.  I ordered a second beer half way through my meal and didn't receive it until about 5 minutes after I finished my meal.     As for the food, our cheese curds appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  My wife has a Caesar Kale salad with Chicken and the Chicken Tortilla Soup. The chicken was very salty and the soup came out barely warm.   I ordered the fish and chips and the fish had been fried so long I honestly thought when they put it down in front of me I was being pranked.  It was almost the color of a brownie, but no it wasn't a prank!   The fish was a thick filet so thankfully once I touched the batter and it exploded into 10,000 pieces the fish inside was still somewhat edible.    When it came to paying our bill we used the machine on the end of the table but it turned out to be out of receipt paper.  We were traveling on business so had to have a receipt for expense purposes.  We ended up having to wait about 10 minutes for our server to appear and tell her what we needed.  She disappeared for 10 minutes then came back with the wrong receipt.   It took another 5 minutes for her to return with the correct receipt.  If you are coming here for classic rock.  Unless you consider Ah Ha - Take on me and  other similar 90's pop Classic Rock then you are probably going to be disappointed."

The tea absent from this picture was as good too. Flavor wise it was what I needed and wanted.  The service was so friendly and always making sure we had enough to drink. The waiting time was around 20 minutes on a busy weekend downtown but worth the wait. They had screens all around showing a sport's game. The sitting was comfortable and the noice level very reasonable.   I would definitely come again and keep on trying their different options and enjoying either the view you can get or just watch a game. I can say I recommend it hundred percent. Provecho!"

I wasn't certain what to order, but I wanted a big healthy salad and I ordered their large Cobb salad. (mixed greens, baby tomatoes, edamame, carrots, radish, egg, bleu cheese, corn, bacon, avocado, ranch) I was very surprised by the size of the salad and with the variety of items it consisted of. It was so good and I know that I took more than half of it home for a second meal. I'm definitely going back to Yard House to order this big salad again!"

Went straight to the bar and ordered a few beers and the Korean BBQ Cheesesteak. This was perfectly made. The meat was tender and tasty, perfect amount of cheese and the bread wasn't hard. I love cheesesteaks and this Korean version was awesome. I also had the fries and they were crispy and perfectly cut as they weren't too thin or too thick. Great meal, highly recommend!"

                "description": "While visiting San Antonio for a convention, our hotel was located across from Yard House, which made it super convenient. We visited late on our first night, around 9pm, and it was still busy. I would assume people visiting the river walk keep this location consistently busy. We ended up sitting at the bar since it was only two of us and could skip the wait.   We order the Zoodle bowl with shrimp and the Steak Bowl. Both were very good! I was surprised how much I enjoyed the zoodles since it was my first time trying them. The price was a little steep, but there were quite a few shrimp to make up for it. Service was fairly consistent and we enjoyed our dinner!"

                "description": "Where to begin... After walking on the River Walk mid day on Memorial Day, I was in the mood for a good chargrilled hamburger  I poked around in Yelp and found this promising looking place.  They were tucked away on an upper floor of Rivercenter Mall, a little pricey, and we had to wait a little to be seated, and a little for our food to be served. And by the way, not an exhorbitant amount of time. It was just busy.  But.... Oh. My. Gosh.  The burger was perfect, one of the best I've had in a while. The first bite had that just a bit of charred crunch and charred flavor, followed by melt in your mouth perfect burger. My wife got fries with hers that were fresh cut properly cooked.  The waiter read my mind by bringing me a two glass refill of my tea/lemonade.  Everything was great. Just a perfect experience. This is a sign of a great manager and staff. My favorite upscale burger place in the area"

I had the blacken grilled chicken Cobb salad and all of the ingredients were were fresh and I was able to customize my order. I also got the grand patron margarita and it's prefect.. not too sweet.. but full of flavor and just perfect.  I would have grabbed another one but I had to go to work.. lol. The server was excellent..I forgot his name but he was very attentive and very informed on choices. I also like the fact that I didn't have to wait on him to check out..I could just pay at my table and go.. it was so convenient and fast. I just hate I couldn't go back before I left.. but next time.. I will be back!"

We had a 15 or so minute wait once we arrived. The menu was awesome and had so many things I wanted to try. I asked the waiter for recommendations. I really wish I would have gotten his name because he was spot on and very sweet. My friend and I split the poke nachos and the lobster noodles. They were both perfect! I could not believe how much lobster (and shrimp and crab) was in it! For $24 dollars it was a lot!! We were so impressed! If you aren't wanting Mexican food and are around the River walk I would def give this place a try!! Edit: friend looked up his name from her emailed receipt - it's Michael S."

They're owned by Darden so if you have an Olive Garden gift card, put it to use here.   I normally would prefer to go to yard house during happy hour, but this time we came during dinner time and we paid for it, bill comes out to much much more.   I always order poke nachos as a staple food they have. My favorite item in their menu and next time, I'll just order extra and not share   They do have a large variety of food, but not as worth as poke nachos.

The rice looked like it had been cooked in a jello mold, which may look nice, but makes it hard on the outside - not something I like, it was also a little bland. Washed it all down with a glass of cider.   Not perfect but still came away full and happy. Would definitely go back again."

It's small and theres a large patio where you can just chill out with your friends.   The Helotes' old town is amazing because the patio is shared by multiple businesses which means you can eat and drink whatever you want from the stores. You can't bring in outside drinks or food but the atmosphere is great. The ambiance is complete with outdoor lights--- which I, as many are, am a sucker for.   On Wednesdays, there is a person who is playing live. Due to COVID, the tables are separated 6 feet apart and no one is supposed to move the seats to keep everyone apart. If you haven't tried this location, I would definitely recommend it."

It was very smooth with a hint of oak. Definitely a little different, but very good.   For now, they only serve beer. If you want a snack, wine 101 has a good selection.   They have a small area with patio tables under the patio, but the common area also has some tables under the shade of the trees.   Street parking is available.

We saw many people come and leave when they discovered The Cracked Mug was closed all Sunday and Wine 101 does not open its kitchen until 4:00.  Seems a huge missed opportunity for these businesses, as I said, at a time when people are looking for places they can go and enjoy a nice open air space.

Every time i come here I always try something different which makes every experience very interesting. You basically just tell the bartender what you feel like drinking as far as flavors (sweet, fruity, botanical, warm, spicy, etc..) and they make a special drink just for you. It seems like they also have signature drinks that they make, Which I have to try soon.   Austin was our bartender and he took very great care of us. Every drink he made was perfection.   The prices are very fair, they make all their cocktails with high grade ingredients and still charge a pretty average price. I love this place and would recommend everyone to come."

Now here is the caveat, you have to have at least some idea of what flavors and liquors you may want in your drink as there is no menu.  If you don't, the bartenders (who are freaking awesome) will try to fill in the gaps with a series of questions to gauge your taste.  A great place for cocktail lovers and those new/getting to the cocktail scene!  I've never been disappointed with a drink I've had and hope you won't either! Cheers!"

The outside was completely unexpected just as the inside and interior of the place was. I enjoyed the ambiance and the romantic setting. The Old Fashions here are made to perfection - I loved watching the process. The bartender was very diligent in his work and also quiet which was a first for me.

Speakeasy vibe in what looks like a converted house on Grayson street- you'll know you're at the right place based off the mailbox. Walk into a dimly lit, intimate vibe. Feeling adventurous? Tell them your spirit of choice, and they'll ask you some follow up questions to make you a unique cocktail. Seriously such a fun experience. Want to stick to your favorite, tried and the cocktail? They'll make that for you too! Not drinking alcohol but don't want to miss out on the fun? They'll make non alcoholic drinks also. Really an amazing vibe and experience."

                "description": "This is, low-key, one of the best bars in San Antonio. Located in an unassuming, unlabeled home, you'll be greeted with dim lighting and a relaxed ambiance when you walk in. This place makes for a great date night spot to enjoy unique cocktails and cozy up on one of the couches in the space. There's also an outdoor lounge if hanging out outside surrounded by twinkling lights is more up your alley. :)  What I really love about this place are the bartenders. You won't find a drink menu at The Modernist. The bartenders are prepped and ready to make any drink or cocktail you could probably request, but what makes this place truly unique is if you tell the bartender what type of liquor or flavors you like in your drink they'll whip up a concoction on the spot for you. I've gone both routes and have never been disappointed.   Check them out during your next night out. You won't be disappointed."

                "description": "First and foremost, this place has awesome bartenders who truly care about the craft of concocting quality cocktails.   Initially, I wasn't sure if I arrived at the right place because it's almost disguised as a regular house. This makes it all the more of a cozy experience.   The bartender who served me was such a delight. He made me two delicious drinks that are in my top five favorite drinks of all time. He used smoked salt to complement my spicy vodka drink (nameless) which was such a great pairing. My second drink was a pisco sour which had the right amount of egg foam and a well balanced alcoholic portion. MAGICAL!   Overall I highly recommend coming here if you want an authentic bar experience without the noise from regular bars that just want to churn out mediocre drinks. Consider this place a little secret that you're in on. Also, free parking near downtown? You can't beat that. BRAVO MODERNIST!!!!!!!! You have my heart."

At night, look for the lights in the backyard, and leading to the backyard.   You can enter the front door, but many enter through the back door.  This is the type of place for cocktail drinkers.  Yes, they have a couple beers on tap, but if you're ordering a cocktail, you should know what you like.  No menu, just expert mixologists that will make you exactly what you ask for.  If you don't like it, no matter how long it takes, they'll make it right or make something different for you.  That's automatic 5 star service right there.  Although they have a spanning selection of hard liquors, liqueurs, garnishes, etc... I asked the bartender for two boozy tiki drinks, which took ages to make, but tasted so great, so fresh...and just a different refreshing take than I've ever tasted before.  Kudos to the mixologist that night, I didn't get his name, but he wore glasses and was on point with everything.  A must stop in SA if you like cocktails or dimly lit places."

He then slammed the door shut behind him.  A few ladies were on their way out saying that a whole bunch of people were leaving. So we knocked again and asked if we could at least split the party 4 and 3, (since we'd be spending the rest of the night together, we really didn't mind), RUDELY he says No because we would still want to be sat together and that the last time they seated a group of 7 people, it ended up being a party of 15, so he wasn't going to seat us at all. Then slammed the door shut again. We would've understood had he'd been nicer about it. Guess those reviews about customer service sucking were accurate. Trying to understand what that group of 15 had to do with us. We were there altogether (knowing that sometimes places don't seat parties unless they are altogether). Shame. We ended up going to Stouts and had a fantastic time with their bartenders."

Their unique approach to making drinks is really what I have always looked for in a bar. It is a cozy environment that really makes you feel like your at a friends house. The bartenders are nice but knowledgeable of everything alcohol related and demonstrate this with the amount of time that they spend on the drinks which would normally be annoying but I really appreciated it here because it added to the feeling of personalization to each drink. The snacks were also a great touch and the back porch is a perfect place to relax after a long day! This is a awesome spot and if you're in San Antonio you must visit."

I sampled a couple of the sours and they were ok, but again, just not my cup of tea, so I won't judge them on that.  Staff was very friendly, very knowledgeable about the different beer selections.  The clientele that we hung out with and spoke with were also very friendly and cool.  Bar area was kind of small but there is also a bit of seating back in the brewing area.

We decided to stop by and see what they had to offer.  It turned out that most of their beers leaned toward the sour end. Sours aren't necessarily my favorite, but I was intrigued by the pickle beer. (Not a fan.) However, they had some dark sours that were actually delicious! This was our third brewery of the day...so that may have influenced my taste buds, but no matter...I still enjoyed them. And the anniversary party was hopping and it seemed like a lot of people love this place.  We'd like to go back and check them out on a non-party day, just to see what they've got. Definitely on our list of places to go again!"

                "description": "Dear city of New Braunfels:  I hope you understand what you have here. New Braunfels brewing Co is in my opinion, one of the best breweries of Texas, definitely the best when it comes to sours (in my humble opinion).  I am gonna go ahead and sound like a pretentious douche, but my husband and I are huge fans of sours, and we have been to over 60 breweries around the country. This one is absolutely a keeper.  The brewery is ran by a family that lives in town, they do everything from cutting the fruit that goes into their beer, to brewing and marketing, so don't expect fanciness, a very small group of people runs the entire show. They are usually very good about updating their menu on facebook.   Remember, this brewery specializes in sours, you will not find the regular styles like Lagers, IPAs and Stouts and such. If you are looking for anything other than sours, please skip it instead of giving it a bad review.  The tap room may be tiny, but it's packed with awesomeness and flavor. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable, and they are always ready to help you and tell you all you need to know about sour beer.  This brewery is not a place to hang out for a long time with your friends, but more of a place for doing a quick tasting and take some bottles home. This is absolutely not a good place for large groups.  I recommend that you buy a flight, which is $8 for 4 small pours, that way you can taste different things. If you want to commit to just one, the prices are very reasonable.   My favorites are Saison de Nefle, Hell yeah! and PKL FKR.  We like their stuff so much that we bought a membership to their club, which is totally worth it."

Very friendly staff were quite informative.  Only the second time I have tried a sour, first time at Jester King and I did not like. They gave me a free taste and off I went.  We quite liked the sours actually better than some of the wheats. We tasted 5 of the 8 taps and liked all but one.   The sours are like a double fermented beer inoculated with live bacteria and can be quite puckering. Some are barrel aged up to a year.  If you're in town I highly recommend stopping in. You can even wander around the small brewery on your own.  Oh btw, they will pour you a cup to go. New Braunfels allows open containers, drink up!"

They don't change the website, but to quote the guy pouring, \"nothing in life is a sure thing\". I'm pretty sure the \"on tap now\" list is supposed to be a sure thing. Thanks for not only being a Dick, but for wasting my time.   2. All of the beer follows the ode if a little spice is perfect the whole bottle must make it better. Not good. I tried 6 of the 8 beers hoping for one I could finish. NOPE   First clue I should have just turned around was the bartender asking me if I was hungover.  (Nope, but thanks for telling me I look like sÂ°~Ã—  before saying welcome to our brewery)   NEVER AGAIN"

The open sign was calling us, and for it being past 8:00, finding a brewery open that late is unique.  The tasting room is fairly small with a few bar stools and a bench in the brewing room. They  invited me to go in the brew room to take pictures.  These brewers are some of the nicest we've met so far. Great company and conversation. They even recommended some other local businesses, which I now have bookmarked.   The beer: they specialize in wheat beer. That's not typically the style of beer I enjoy, but I did find one called the \"Hot Child\"- a cucumber and jalapeÃ±o infused beer. We only had time to have one beer as their tasting room closes at 9:00. Currently their tasting room is open Thursday-Friday 5-9pm. I hope to see these guys at Wurstfest someday."

All that said, I was BLOWN away by the whole experience. We came on Repeal Day - a celebration of the day prohibition ended- and there was a live jazz band and a burlesque style performance.   It. Was. Epic.  I am honestly considering flying back to San Antonio next December just to experience their Repeal Day celebrations again!   Beyond the show, the food and drinks are also worthy of a repeat. The drinks were strong (I would expect nothing less from a previous speakeasy) and had fun names and creative concoctions.   We ordered the plantain chips to start, the brisket sandwich and pork snitzel, topped of with the fried apple pie for dessert. Everything was well prepared and delicious.

We ordered the Bexar Hug and Fancy CVS cocktails. For appetizers, we ordered chalupitas and chili salt fries. Really liked the chalupitas but the fries were okay. For main course, we ordered the jerk shrimp wraps and bison burger. Both these were really good. For the dessert, we ordered the fried apple pie. I am so glad we ordered this inspite of being very full. This was delicious and so flavorful. Not overly sweet but deliciousness in every bite.   This place is huge so there is ample seating. Recommend stopping by this place on the river walk for good food great ambience and good service."

A nice, well maintained \"old school\" building with an outdoor patio area overlooking the river.  Nice!  NARRATIVE: The Esquire Tavern is an old school tavern.  They have an extensive beer, wine and spirits menu also a food menu guaranteed to satisfy the best frugal taste buds.  When I saw on the menu they offered a home made fried Bologna sandwich, I was done looking.  My sandwich came with a huge slice of fried Bologna, almost an half an inch thick.  Savory, rice and not greasy.  It was so good that before we headed back to home, I made it point to return and grab another sandwich.   SCENE: The Esquire Tavern is located on E. Commerce Street just off of S. Saint Marry's Street and the patio area of the restaurant overlooks the famous \"River Walk.\"  RECOMMENDATION(S): San Antonio has so many great places to eat, its hard to recommended a few or just one.  I can say, the reason The Esquire Tavern stands out in my mind is that Bologna sandwich.  I will NEVER be able to think about San Antonio without thinking about it."

For my entree I got the brisket sandwich with house chips and pickled veggies and it was great. I loved that it came on Texas toast. My husband on the other hand was a little disappointed that his jerk shrimp wrap was iceberg lettuce instead of a tortilla - no where did it mention that was the case.

The Esquire burgers were not tasty, just plain bland with an oversized dry bun. The seafood platter consisted of over cooked shrimp and fish with soggy fries. They do not care how the food tastes. 30% of the menu items were not available. Why? That's pretty bad. They're located on Riverwalk which pretty much means they get business regardless of the food they throw out - very disappointing overall. Save your time and money - instead  go to the St.Anthony hotel bar and order the smashburger for the same price - now THAT was a great burger not to mention the cocktails....I can def recommend that"

I always get excited when our hotel is near this spot bc it is one of the few legit places to get a craft cocktail in downtown SA."

We had the Troy and Abed Drinking Whiskey which was undoubtedly the worst drink I have had in my natural born life (think Draino).  They did comp the drink for me.  They handled the experience well.

                "description": "One of the best places to visit if in SA.  It has an old-world vibe but with a modern \"hipster\" edge.  The cocktails are ALWAYS on point and are exceptionally hand-crafted.  You won't get a quick refill if you order a cocktail and that's for good reason.  Their menu of cocktails seems to always change and I've never ordered one that WASN'T ridiculously good!!!  Admittedly, we've never had the food there, but it looks amazing and I see a lot of people having dinner when we visit.  The waitstaff, while somewhat aloof, is always prompt and knowledgeable about the cocktails.  Make sure to sit in a booth.  They are so cozy and old-world feeling.  Great location if you are staying downtown.   They have a \"speakeasy bar\" downstairs that doesn't open until 7 and that looks very intriguing.    This place is very well-run and pays attention to details.  I just love it.   This is always a MUST-VISIT when in SA."

                "description": "I'm on a hunt. I am here in San Antonio on business travel and not content on being isolated to the nearby spots I wanted to see the unique flairs the city has to offer. When I read The Esquire Tavern has a 100 ft bar I simply had to check it out.   I immediately found the atmosphere befitting of a tavern. Dark wood tones, dim lighting, a bit narrow. It felt appropriate. The stage for service was immediately set when the hostesses brushed me away and told me I could sit anywhere I wanted at the bar. It was very dismissive. So I went and sat at the bar closest to the kitchen. Figured it would be a nice busy spot. I sat there for ten minutes before a waitress noticed I was there, got me a QR menu to scan, and told me she'd tell the bartender I was there.   And then I sat for another five minutes before the most unsuitable bartender came by and asked for my order. My bartender could look and act no more displeased with her lot if she wore a sign that said \"I don't want to be here\". Now it is a 100 ft bar and I noted only three bartenders in this 100 ft space on what was forecasted as potentially one of the busiest holiday weekends which I felt was a bit absurd. While my bartender and another bartender seemed to work the entire bar the third stayed at the far end and didn't seem to venture beyond five feet of his spot.   That said it also didn't help that every other employee was taking quick breaks right next to me. Look, I get it, people need breaks. Drink water. Hydrate. But why do it right in front of a bunch of customers who are receiving no service? As they fixed each other's collars, talked about life, and they stood their within hearing distance I tried to withhold my disappointment because I know they didn't work the bar. I knew that's where they just happened to grab water. But I swear even the kitchen staff looked exasperated as they peered through and could see this clump just jabbering.   In short the service was pitiful. I have had better service at Burger King. McDonald's absolutely has them beat. Even getting the check in the end was a hassle. There was another party sitting next to me who wanted to get their check when my meal was served, I finished my meal, and then joined them in trying to flag down the bartender to get my check. Pitiful service. Easily the worst I have had on the trip.   That said the food was great. The cheeseburger was an absolute delight. It was so juicy! Flavorful! A melody of flavors dancing in my mouth! Oooh that cheeseburger was soooo good! The fries were ok. The cheeseburger delicious. The Moscow mules were typical of the area - fairly ginger beer forward and light on the vodka.   The cheeseburger and ambiance were the only items giving them a three star rating."

They were out of Alamo Golden Ale when I was here and tried to order one.  The menu doesn't have much that stood out to me.  I tried the $12 Shrimp Toast that made me realized not everything deep fried is worth eating.  There wasn't much shrimp on the toast and it could have done without the extra breading.  My friends did enjoyed their bison burger and pulled pork sandwich.  .|\\---/| | o_o | .\\_^_/..2021"

I had to really want to get here this time by dodging and weaving through traffic and construction..  But,it's worth it.  Definite go. If only to get away from the cheesey River Walk places! There is a really long old antique bar,several booths and tables in back. Fairly subdued lighting. Decent drinks and some ok food.   It's definitely a safer place than the first time I was here in the 80z. Well let me think. Safer from impromptu brawls with drunken strangers. But, our friend covid is lurking so keep your distance!  Check it out"

Kudos to the Beverage Mgr; well done.    Interesting mixed drinks started us out on our Esquirre expedition.  The Bidi Bidi was a bit smokier than my wife expected, but I chalk that up to their unusual pineapple sourcing.  All of my Double-Vodka Collins were right on point.  We had to try the Beefeater 25, and I can only say WOW.  Wow; this is the smoothest and most citrus-ey gin I've enjoyed.  Well done.   Our Chalupitas appetizer was good, although served late - with our entree's.   I ordered the Fried Seafood Sampler; tge server was immediately able to tell me they were out of seafood.  Disaster averted; I ordered the fantastic Bison Burger!  (I wish I had a $ for every time it has taken a restaurant 45+ minutes to tell me that my elected entree' was out-of-stock!)  My wife ordered the Cheeseburger MEDIUM-WELL.  It came out red and bloody, but hey - mistakes happen, and this is a TAVERN.  They recooked the burger, but sadly, they then charged us for (2) Cheesburgers.  Whoops. The manager fixed this when I called - all is well!  We ordered \"To-Go\" margaritas and daiquiri's; they were great.    Loved the ambiance and our waiter, although they need to work on the details."

                "description": "Saw The Esquire Tavern on a TV show said it was one of the oldest bars on the Riverwalk. It looked cool wanted to see for ourselves. Has an entrance on the river or the street. Walking in it is a long skinny room with tables on one side and bar on other. You have to order at the bar. Had a sign on tables do not have table service. You can sit at the bar.  They have a drink menu if you want to try something different or order any drink they should be able to make it. The place was dark kind of cool looking but just a bar. They have food downstairs. Not sure maybe have food in the back seating area to order.   Was not wowed the place was a little boring. If just want a buy a drink and get out of the heat it is an option. Staff not very helpful kind of ignore you. The price is a little steep and make sure you check you bank statement after you get home we had an extra charge."

Their craft drinks are amazing, and they used to have a bartender works towards the left side of the bar that I love the way he makes my cocktails, but the last few times I have visited, I couldn't find him.   Their house tequila shots are amazing; hence, anything that is made with the house tequilas are amazing as well. Our favorite and one of a kind would be the 'Bloody Mary'. Ask for house tequila with blue cheese. Trust me, it won't go wrong."

I've been here before with the girls and today I came with my husband - both times a flashlight was needed.   This bar gives me a little bit of gentlemen club vibes , bottle everywhere, very dim lighting, men bartenders dressed up, cigar cabinet.   Definitely a nice place for a small group of 2-3 to have amazingly crafted drinks and conversation. Not really a girls night out type of feel. It's a small place so the best seats are around the bar but I believe there are 2 couches for a more relaxed feel.   Our bartender was such a gentlemen and surprised us with our drinks because my husband and I didn't know what to order. We got the bluegrass and the righteous- both so delicately crafted with a skill - our bartender for sure had a bachelor's degree on this.  My insides exploded with each sip. So yummy. There really is a drink for everyone in this. I definitely recommend this bar."

I went to meet up with him and he chose Bar 1919.  Bar 1919 is a speakeasy in the Blue Star Complex.  Parking is relatively easy to find in the plaza but the bar is hidden in the back of the plaza underground.  It took me a few minutes to find it.    I ordered 2 cocktails off their specials menu.  Both were delicious!    RUN to this place if you LOVE speakeasies and cocktails.  Definitely an experience.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!"

                "description": "1919 has all the vibes that make a speakeasy great: excellent drinks, friendly bartenders, a relaxed ambiance, and in a location that is hidden just enough away from the hooplah that is reality. (#1) This is truly one of my favorite places in all of San Antonio.  First timers are more than likely going to get lost coming here. The signage is minimal at best and it's hard to see / hear anything that's going on. A key item is the illuminated \"Joe's Jazz\" sign above the basement level where the bar is located. Look beneath the street level railing and notice the blacked out windows. If one is lucky, they might even catch someone drinking along the limited outdoor seating, but inside is where all the action is. (#2)  The elongated bar, along with the ambient lights behind it, is magical in its own little way. It's easy to be impressed with the space and ventilation (#3), where there is seating on each end in the form of couches and tables. I personally think the bar is the best place to be.  It doesn't take a cocktail connoisseur to notice the bartenders are more like mixologists. Their crafty ways can whip up one hell of a drink and the kind that isn't just perfect for a photo op, but complex with its own liquor'y way. Whether it's a classic cocktail like a sazerac or an old fashioned, or one of their signature concoctions like the muthafuckah jones or pimm's cup, everyone is in for a treat. Personally, I like the to tell the bartender a spirit I'm feeling and just let him / her surprise me with something. It's worked quite well.  Whether it's a date night or a night cap, this is an excellent place to enjoy an adult beverage. Drinks are understandably in the $12-18 range and are certainly on the upper echelon of libations. Come alone or bring a friend and step into an oasis that only speakeasies like 1919 can provide. _____________ (#1) Or if to be taken literally, a very large parking lot. (#2) Not a poor choice of words, at all. (#3) Fancy cocktails and hot weather is not anyone's idea of a good time."

I love that it truly has a speakeasy vibe.   This time we decided to try a pour of Pappy Van Winkle  and a cocktail. First, for those that want to have a taste of pappy without breaking the bank, this is your place. They have reasonably priced options. I tried the righteous cocktail. It was perfect. Not too sweet. Great taste. They do offers plenty of cocktails and have a lot of liquor to choose from.      Right now, during the covid pandemic, they do have someone at the door checking your temperature and escorting your group to your seats.  Parking is shared and can be difficult."

In fact, THE SECRET IS OUT. 1919 has over 400 reviews at the moment, which is a tad on the high side for anything [in San Antonio], and it's not hard to understand why. THIS PLACE IS EXCELLENT.  They have it all when it comes to booze. You could LITERALLY fill a moderately-priced above-ground pool with all the amber liquid they have on display. There are clear alcohols available too, but bartenders take much more pride(trust me) in the aged stuff that tends to fall on the visual spectrum somewhere between golden and brown.  Some reviews say they have over 1000 bottles. This is seeable and believable, but what'sÂ truly impressive within 1919: the bartenders have knowledge and details on all these obscure bottles AND they can steerÂ you in some tasty directions."

It was completely empty when we arrived (given it was a Monday at like 4 PM) so we thought it might have been closed, but thankfully it was not.  When we saw that they had $5 happy hour cocktails, the gloves were off and the Asian glows were on. Unbeknownst to us, one of the best drinks we'll ever have was about to be made, and for only $5(!?) Five bucks in Chicago gets you no more than a shot of bottom shelf tequila at best!  All the other drinks we tried were excellent as well but I honestly can't remember which ones they were. But the Waterfall is one I definitely will not forget."

The bar staff are welcoming and entertaining. The vibe is speakeasy you can go dressed up but also under dressed. I hadn't had an old fashion in a long time its a simple drink but they make some very crafted drunk there that are enjoyable to watch being made. I suggest  1919 for a great experience on a date."

We got the Hemingway Daiquiri, since our friends just got back from the Florida Keys.  It was a refreshing drink for a hot summer day.  Found a corner coach and table to enjoy our drinks and catch up on their trip.  If you are looking for a cocktail bar, then stop in the Blue Star and check this place out."

                "description": "A cozy place and a really nice, speakeasy-type vibe. The mixologists weren't pretentious in the slightest; in fact, I was a little nervous to ask for a suggestion because I didn't want to be that annoying patron, but he offered a few alternates for my second drink instead of having me order the same one. And, the second drink was up my alley!  The cocktails here are truly crafted, which explains the pricetag, but even then I feel like they're really reasonably priced. It reminded me a lot of Please Don't Tell, the famous NYC speakeasy, but way more casual and way friendlier. This will definitely be in our rotation!"

We arrived around 5:45/6PM and grabbed seats at the bar, which was fun because you could watch the bartenders make the drinks. The list of cocktails was very impressive and I was glad to see a number of gin drinks. We enjoyed the vibe and will be back!"

We got the mother board which is a sampler of all the beers. My SO and I got one mother board to share and sample all the beers. It was a lot of fun and we each had our favorites. There was lots of cute shaded outdoor space, and a patio with misters. There was a tiny table inside, as well, but it's mainly geared towards outdoor seating. There was a Mediterranean food truck on-site as well, we didn't check it out, but it's good to know there's a food option. We enjoyed coming out here and hope to be back!"

There is a covered patio but limited seating. You'll also find a small 21+ seating area. Come with your friends or bring your whole family as they have a huge play area for the kids and ample space for them to roam around. They also have games for adults such as washers and corn hole.  The entire venue is clean and well maintained. In lieu of Covid masks are required indoors when ordering your beer, and they have hand sanitizer stations setup throughout.   My beverages of choice were the Reese's Stout and Hobanero. The Reese wasn't very peanut buttery but it was still a nice light smooth stout. The Hobanero was fun with an IPA touch and not as hot/spicy as I anticipated it to be. You also have the option to have it dressed and I highly recommend it. Besides beer they have wine and soft drinks available as well as light snacks. You can bring in outside food but they do have a food truck on-site. Check their website for information on live music and what food trucks will be there for your visit.   If you're visiting or live in the San Antonio area I highly recommend adding this brewery on your places to visit. Especially while the weather is so nice!"

                "description": "I was surprised to see a brewery in Adkins, Tx when looking to get a drink. My boyfriend and I decided to check it out since it had pretty good reviews.  The drive is very scenic and green which I enjoyed. We went on a Friday at 7 p.m. and it was a packed house. There was plenty of parking in the area. They had live music going when we got there and we were greeted with friendly faces all around. There was plenty of seating outside. We got to try samples and the person helping us was wonderful and made recommendations based on what our favorite beer was.  The prices were reasonable and we payed $17 dollars for a flight a 10 oz beer. I decided to go with their 10 oz snifter Salted Pilsner with Lucas in the rim. This would have to be one of best beers I have had from a brewery that I loved. My boyfriend got the flight of different beers and his favorite was the Oreo Stout that literally tasted like Oreos. It was delicious and I appreciated the fact that these are flavors you can't find anywhere else.  The environment is laid back and somewhere you can go to enjoy the sunset and hear some live music. I will totally be coming back to enjoy a beer on the weekend."

Be sure to check their website before making the trek out here! I think they're usually open two weekends a month. It took us a good 45-50 minutes to get here from far west San Antonio. However! This place is awesome and you can make a day out of it and also hit up seersucker (gin/vodka) while you're in the area.   They offer beer flights and different sizes of each beer and have a good variety of beers. Our favorites were the Lucas and sienna ale. The staff was super friendly. The inside area is small with only a couple of tables. Outside area is covered and has fans. There is a large yard area and games. They have a stage for live music for the evenings. Great beer and a nice location once you get there!"

                "description": "Craft Breweries in Texas remind me of the stories of lore. Of settlers, prospectors who came here to seek their fortunes. Their only resource an entrepreneurial spirit that led them to certain success or ruin. Cactus Land Brewery in Adkins, Texas continues in that tradition with an absolutely charming place, a friendly vibe and with flavors as spacious this side of the Pecos.  Coming from San Antonio it's really not too far a drive from here. It's hidden in a labyrinth of small winding roads punctuated by tractors. I've experienced breweries in different settings: industrial areas, a college town, by the ocean. I must admit experiencing a brewery in the country is unique and a first for me. If you look across the way there is another property with horses.   I think I was initially struck by the sight of that, seeing a brewery in the middle of country land. It feels like by design the idea was to contrast the vibe of a brewery with the rugged terrain. For example their taproom is small but exquisitely decorated. The outdoor area is more vast with ample seating and tables. The balance between nature and the urban sensibilities of a brewery are simply yet beautifully stated. I can only imagine this place when the weather becomes cooler, in autumn.   Which brings me to all the important things. The aesthetics as I've alluded to are impeccable. I like that there's a visible board with all available taps: names, abv, pour sizes and prices. Above all the service was excellent. The principal owner, southern drawl and all was beyond friendly. I've been to breweries where staff motions for you to make a decision. Here the owner understands that you don't choose a beer, a beer chooses you.   As far as their offerings they have something for everyone's taste: gose's, ipa's, stouts and blondes. In addition they offer sampler sizes, flights and crowlers. I tried the \"Reese\" a peanut butter stout, \"Texas Juice\" a hazy ipa in vogue at the moment and \" Eat your Breakfast\" another stout with maple syrup. I think out of all of them I enjoyed the \"Reese\" the most. Drinking it reminded me of tearing into a package of peanut butter cups. I tend to think they understand that we attach memories to flavors. Thus beers are brewed with this in mind.  Cactus Land Brewery is a small place big on charm. The beers have flavors as big as a ten gallon hat, made better by excellent service. This taproom is a perfect escape especially from the hustle/bustle of the city. If you like trying out new breweries put this on your check off list.   ps. (Yes there's more!) I don't know why but I felt like any moment George Strait was gonna walk in and say, \"Well excuse me but I think you got my chair.\""

They are also one of the few breweries in the San Antonio area, in my opinion, that consistently puts out great beers. Whether you're in the mood for something light and calm or have a hankering for a bit of excitement for the old tastebuds...they wont't let you down. They always have a nice variety of styles on tap to choose from.  Check their website before going to see who will be playing on stage and what food truck will be serving up dishes."

Lucky for us we checked out the reviews before hand and saw that they are definitely kid friendly!  Not only was the LUCAS beer delicious the experience and vibe was so chill and relaxing. We got a root beer drink for my daughter, a flight for me and a pint for my husband and combined our bill was about 24$. For us that was such a great price for the enjoyment of the property and live music.  The land it sits on is beautiful and when we showed up they had grouchy mamas food truck!  There is picnic tables to sit on under a large beautiful tree  Or tables and chairs to sit on under a porch like area that has a fan going for the heat.  They also offer complementary cups for water.  Towards the side of that porch is where they have a playground for the kiddos with two sings and two slides!  They also have the land gated where your kids can run and play.  If you want to bring a ball for you child to play with it probably would be a good idea while enjoying your beer.  Overall I loved the atmosphere! We will def be back!one last thing! The staff was very friendly and helpful! It was our first time so they offered samples of the beer which was perfect for picking my drinks!"

Make sure to check out their open hours on their Facebook page before you make the long trek to Adkins, because I'm pretty sure they're only open the first and third weekend of the month.   The venue is nice and open with plenty of seating outside. There wasn't a lot of room inside though. Staff were super friendly and helpful, and we had a great experience.  The beer wasn't my favorite, but only because they were heavy on the sours. We opted for two flights of five, that way we could try all 10 of the beers on tap. Out of the 10, 5 or more were pretty sour, and unfortunately out of all the different varieties of beer, sour is my least fave. And the flights were a bit pricier than I expected: we paid around $26 for our two flights, but at least we got to try them all. The other beers were pretty good though! The IPA was delicious, and I'd definitely take a pint of that.   Although I was a bit disappointed in the flights, I would like to come out here again and check out some of their new brews."

First off, we have a 3yo and I was so happy to see that this place is super family friendly. There's cornhole, a playground and plenty of grass to run around in. On top of that they do offer NA drinks so it was easy to keep our kiddo happy. We tried a lot of their beers and I have to say I enjoyed the majority of them. (I may be in love with Raspberry PopPop). They had a good little acoustic set going on and a very nice food truck. The whole thing was incredibly chill and we can't wait to go again but bring friends this time. LOVE!!!"

                "description": "I have had the pleasure of visiting The Friendly Spot a number of times, as it is a local San Antonio gem.  They have a great beer selection with both draft and cans/bottles available.  The selection ranges from the big name domestics and imports to the local craft beer Texas produces.  They do a great job of keeping the selection relevant with seasonal beers as well.  The food is pretty good.  I would compare it to any good local eatery.  The brisket nachos have a subtle smokey flavor and the Friendly burger is juicy and bursts with flavor on every bite.  Since they use quality ingredients, the Friendly burger can be a tad salty with the seasoning on the burger and the amazing slices of bacon that are used.  My favorite drink though would be the Wutang frozen beverage.  It goes down so easy and can be a pretty sneaky drink, so be careful, but you really cannot go wrong ordering it.  Whether you're from San Antonio, or just visiting, you really cannot go wrong stopping by this local gem."

How hard is it to add one more beer puller? We are here on a Monday at 2. Literally 30 people in line, one bartender, back bar not open.  Bartender is now telling people not to order food. I get it's hard to find fast food employees, but there are good tips to be had here. I am quite sure they can hire bit of help at the taps. Feel bad for the bartender...not his fault.

The best hand cut fries I've had in San Antonio, well seasoned and crispy. The drinks were super tasty too, highly recommend the blood orange mule. Bonus, they had bomb pops for the kids. A perfect spot to spend a beautiful afternoon."

The Friendly Spot has been around for years and is the spot for a relaxed drink and meal. They have plenty of seating to meet friends for a drink before heading to explore South Town, or just hanging out.   Although, I did not have food this last visit, I was able to enjoy a sunny Sunday with friends after breakfast. They all ordered the Sangria, which looked pretty good, while I had the Watermelon GT. It wasn't crowded at all, which is a plus in these Covid times, and there was plenty of seating.  This is a good hangout to enjoy Summer evenings, or cooler Fall days. Its location is ideal, and their prices affordable. You can't go wrong as a start to your evening, or an early morning meeting."

Well, I found this bartender and it was no exaggeration.  I wouldn't call him names like some other reviewers but he was, to be polite, rough around the edges and startlingly angry.  It's ironic at a place with friendly in the name.  I avoided him the rest of the evening and had a great time.  I live the big screens for a game and love the vibe of the place.  I'm guessing Attila The Hun is harmless and there is a reason they keep him around.  The food is very limited and not very good so eat before you come."

Sorry, no beer flights, and I see why, you don't want to get something your not happy with, plus they will give you sample.

                "description": "So what do you do if you are off the beaten tracks outside of SA.. roaming around from New Berlin to New Braunfels and looking for a bit more  action .. Yelp actually points me me that there is an actual brewery in middle of nowhere, just drive through some windy roads to get there.  Well that seems like a fun adventure on a Saturday afternoon.    Little did I know that this little brewery would be located in the middle of a preserve.  This is where hiking trails meets beers. No masks need rules just some friendly owners ready to talk beer and God's country.   Well let me back up a bit as the hiking part is not quite is not quite available aw of 2021.  But the owners of this wonderful property own all of the acres of this incredible property so maybe this may become the next latest and greatest thing since yoga and beer drinking came to be..  I loved everything about this place.  It was spread out so you could find a spot without being disturbed.  They had picnic tables to hang out under the trees, even rocking chairs for grandma. Totally open to all age groups from the kiddos to oldies but goodies.  Normally I'd not want what could be described as chaos in a normal brewery setting but with the beauty and spaciousness everyone seems to get along and make it work.  Kids and AA/NA 'rs are drinking the hibiscus tea while the majority are enjoying a freshly brewed beer.    Beers are a nice mix here. They have nice light options for the Texas heat like a 4.8% Pilsner kolsch Hefeweizen and orange juice infused pale.  Then they get more serious going to a stout w/marshmallow graham crackers and coco nibs and get all the way to a 9% imperial stout with blackstrap molasses that comes regular or bourbon barrel aged. Those only come in a 6 oz pour which was appreciative considering we all do need to sometime and head back to civilization...  I loved all of the beers especially the Pilsner as it was so refreshing in a hot day.  But even the darker beers were super smooth.  I also loved how they gave you taste tests before committing.     They even gave a bit of entertainment going on with a guitar player on the outdoor patio.  Kids were dancing and adults hanging out with their pets. Yep i didn't see anyone not having a fun time, especially when most people have been deprived so to say over the past year, cough cough:D  This was a great find for us venturers, and I wholeheartedly recommend you bring your friends and family to this wonderful scenic treasure.  Yes Beer does exist in God'scountry. Say Amen to that .."

Off the beaten path of 1863, snuggled in the countryside with abundant outdoor seating and space for dogs to play and kids to run. There is shade, which is nice but an inside area for those triple-digit days. There are outdoor fire pits for when the weather is actually enjoyable in Texas.  There is usually an on-site food truck on the weekends. The beer is very crafty and creative. My first 2 visits were very excellent. Recently, my trips have still been enjoyable but a bit disappointing. While I admire the creative side of their brews, I do not care for everything to be fruit-infused. I don't mine 1 beer being fruity, but when that is all there is to choose from (other than the Kolsch) it gets old, fast. When I first was visiting this brewery I loved their porters. I haven't seen them in months. I think I would frequent this place like i used to if there were more non-fruity options.  Other than that, I love how it's family-owned, a large, open space, and just a relaxing atmosphere. Hopefully some non-fruity porters or ambers show up soon so I can head back out."

Beautiful location, both the brewery and the gorgeous outdoor seating area.  Feels quintessentially central Texan. LOVE IT. It was made all the more enjoyable by the live music being played the night of my visit. This place would be worth going to if the beer wasn't very good....but that is FAR from the case. The beers are fantastic with a wide range of both familiar and eclectic styles. You can get 5oz pours of anything, enabling you to try quite a few without getting too tipsy. The customer service was friendly as can be. I will 100% be back next time I am in the area. Drink local!"

Food trucks would also be a wise improvement, but perhaps they didn't have trucks on the day we came."

Great event! 5 stones is a Christian brewery and apparently they do these live music events several times a year. This one was live Christmas music and awesome beers (and some wines) in an awesome outdoor, family friendly (including the dog) environment that caters to the ability for social distancing. What a cool experience. I was only able to try two of their beers, but both were delicious! I highly recommend both Merry Christmas and Toby G's. All of their beers and made with seasonal ingredients. The Merry Christmas is a fairly typical style Christmas Ale, but delicious. The Toby G's is a family pecan pie recipe made into a beer. Sounded strange, but I love Pecan Pie, so I tried it. So good!! I will definitely come back to this place. Hopefully I'll get to try more of the beers next time. A friend was telling me about a pineapple jalapeÃ±o beer they do in the summer time. Sign me up!!"

Its an awesome place to go just to meet up with a couple friends, lowkey date night, or even take a book or laptop to do some work/journaling while enjoying a tasteful beer of your choice.

Plenty of local and out of state micro brews available here.  Don't expect to find any Bud or Miller products.  Mike served us today and after I ordered my beer, he said \"if you like that one, you might like this one.  It's a bit different but...\" and then he continued to describe the flavor of the beer and gave me a free sample.  I was really impressed by the interaction and the beer knowledge he had.  It looks like they have 33 beers on tap and they also have a good selection of canned beers.    A lot of their draft beers can't be found in local stores but fear not; you can purchase a growler from them (or bring your own) and bring it back for refills of whatever they have on tap.  Support this local business and get here fast - you will thank me for it later!  If this location isn't near you, find one of the other three locations."

My friend invited me over to enjoy the Smash Bros tournament again, and it was a lot of fun. I didn't imbibe alcohol this time around, but everyone's beers looked delish.  The bar is still kept very clean, and everyone participating in the tournament shows great sportsmanship. There's a table closer to the door who also hangs out here week after week, and they spend hours drawing and making art. There's enough space to accommodate lots of groups of folks, even an outdoor patio for more legroom (though the interior itself is definitely roomy)  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but a food truck parked out back and provided some Asian eats for hungry gamers and artists alike. I love that with all the BH you can bring in food, as I brought my dinner from Chipotle earlier that evening.  Perhaps my most absolute favorite thing was a visit from a customer who had the most adorable, softest, plushiest shiba inu. omg. Best doge. (yes, dogs are allowed on the patio!)"

It's always fun to go to places like that and try new things.

They seem to have awesome events (went to the May the 4th be with you event and got a beer with a souvenir cup for only $7.50!).  They have a really good variety of craft beer as well as games to keep you entertained. They have a patio outside and I believe they have a food truck on certain days. If you like to try different kinds of beer, this is definitely the place for you!"

While we shouldn't have waited for about 2.5 hours for a table to free up,  I suppose the best of things are always accidentally beget.   While we waited, we wandered into the plaza next door and jumped into Big Hops. We didn't expect much, as we knew nothing of this place, but we quickly fell in love!!  While I'm not the beer person, I was still able to enjoy their small selection of wine and cider. We absolutely loved the subtle geek culture everywhere and the inviting staff. On our next visits we were allowed to bring in the sandwiches we got at Fire Subs next door to get an alcoholic refreshment to go with it. This place offers a casual vibe that's perfect for meeting your amigos in a non-formal setting. They also have some board games you can play with on a shelf.   So if you're looking for a casual chat and beer, this place makes for a great rendezvous point!"

                "description": "This place is farther away from my normal spot, which is Big Hops on Huebner, but not by much. What draws me to the Huebner location is the proximity to my work and the ability to hide there whilst traffic does its thing outside with me not in it, but merrily sippin' IPAs instead.  But what draws me to the Bitters location is far more innate for me. Sure, they have much of the same beer and deals, but here they have SMASH BROS. If there's one thing I love in tandem with beer, it's video games, and especially THIS video game. I've been an avid player of Smash Brothers since its inception on the Nintendo 64. Needless to say, me and my brother have found a spot to be every Wednesday night from now until the sun consumes the earth.  For those not into video games, they always have sports up on the many TVs and they have things like: darts, pool, and even a LIBRARY for nerds! (me). The latter had me the most excited, because it's one of those DIY libraries where people just contribute willy-nilly and I think that's rad.  If you like beer (good beer), you owe it to yourself to check this place out!"

Whereas they usually sell them for around the same price as anywhere else, even liquor stores, I drove across town for a 6-pack after finding it on Untappd. What usually goes for $15 for the 6-pack they wanted $42. Went down the st to a liquor store and got it for $15. It was just a mass produced IPA, not some bourbon barrel aged stouts."

                "description": "We stumbled into Big Hops on a quiet Saturday evening after a wild shopping spree at Hobby Lobby.   The place is pretty huge actually! Wall to wall chalkboard menus displayed their beer selection and the upcoming events. There's a back smoking section past the pool table. The place had quiet a few picnic tables and ample bar seats.   You can tell this establishment makes a major name for itself selling tshirts, stickers and growlers in several different sizes. We settled on the 64 oz growler which holds 4 pints I believe.   Service was a little off to me. The server kept asking what I wanted and what was I having, so when I said \"I'll just have some water\", I was a little surprised when she handed me a glass and said \"serve yourself over there\" and pointed to the water jug. She became super friendly after I told her I was on a detox though.   This place comes prepared with a board game library. We found boggle in the mix. I love that game to pieces so we played a few rounds before settling on a beer to fill the growler and headed home.   We'll definitely be rolling through to catch up on some of the local beers in the future."

My favorite meals: - Turkey Pesto Sandwich - Soup of the Day and Pesto Pasta Salad  The staff there is quick and friendly; what more could you ask for? Side note - their website is not regularly updated so the prices at the counter may be a tid bit more than what is listed.   TIP: Order ahead for pick-up. The line to order can be pretty lengthy, but if you have a take out order, you can skip ahead!"

A stones throw away from the BnB I was staying at it was a bit tight inside of what seemed to be a former gas station.  There is seating outside but was cold about 45 degrees so opted for the cramped interior.  Had a really good selection craft beers where I enjoyed a Belgian Triple.  The place closed down around 10pm on this early off peak weekday so had to walk a few doors down to find an open kitchen for late dinner."

                "description": "The Filling Station Tap Room is like some brew gateway before you hit the main hubs like Blue Star or The Friendly Spot. Though small, it has lots of charm. Inside it fits the brew keep and no more than 6 people at any given time. There is a chalkboard that has the brews on tap, mostly and mainly IPA's. Along the walls are the remnants of tap handles of long gone kegs for example Sierra Nevada, Guadalupe Brewing Co., Firestone etc.                   The brew keep serves you your selection. Music from a college station radio cast is piping on the stereo. It's small and on a winter night after work, extremely cozy. But above all and I would be re missed if I did not overstate this, the brews are beyond El Cheapo! Some or most of these brews go for 7 bucks just down the road.. Here the beers typically range from 2 bucks to 6. That is so cool, especially in the bourgie King William District where you are charged just for looking at anything.            I do like this place but I do have a few issues with it.    1.) I don't get the whole plastic cup thing. I know you are getting a brew at a substantial discount but some of these brews are noble and sit and drink better in glass. Bud is meant for a plastic cup but not a Brooklyn Chocolate Stout! It deserves a better place than in some arbitrary Dixie cup to showcase it's masterpiece of flavor!   2). I noticed on their Facebook that they seldom update their brew selections. They should do this weekly. The Growler and The Friendly Spot do this regularly. Just one quick pic of their brew selections on the chalkboard, put it on their page and then vamonos. I know they have a twitter account now, which is helpful. They  typically get a crowd, from the looks of it bike riders that probably goes there on a daily basis. And buys on a whim. But what about your untypical patron? You have a great selection of brews why not showcase them?  3.)   The third issue, and I believe the most important is what really sets the brewpubs from places that just tap brew for you. The server served us our beer and did not say anything instead choosing to play with his phone. Places like The Busted Sandal and The Ten Eleven are hosts by proxy, and will talk your ear out about their brews or in most cases beer in general. I like that and as a rule of thumb most brew lovers appreciate that touch. A simple, \"how's it going\", \"if you need anything let me know\" or \"what brings you here today\" goes a long way. We don't have to be best friends. Just fake it. But acknowledge we are there and be on with your business.       Given these things I like this place. The brews are cheap. I like the intimate vibe, cozy space. And I definitely will be coming back. If you want an alternative to The Friendly Spot, whose brews can be pricey or just want to go to a place to chill check this place out. On cold winter nights they have wood burning outside at no extra charge..."

The barkeep let me taste everything I was interested in. They have 4 or 5 seats inside, a covered patio area with tables, and a couple of tables in the old horseshoe driveway.  There's not much to say except this is a fantastic neighborhood concept blending and keeping history in the local community while invigorating the economy.  And a bigger plus... if you live nearby, you can walk or stagger instead of risking a DUI or causing injury to a pedestrian.  Also while there is technically no good at the Filling Station, the owner owns the Station Cafe next door.  Cons, you can't leave an open tab at the Filling Station and use the same credit card next door for food. Pros, you can bring your beer from the Filling Station into the Station Cafe.  Can't wait until I'm back in San Antonio... I will be back!"

If you find yourself south of downtown then Filling station tap room is your best bet for dozens of beers taps on a constant rotation.   I also challenge someone to find a better price on craft beers on tap. Most beers pour for $4.50 and less. I'm not talking your old man's miller lite. I'm talking great big bold, high abv beers from some of America's best breweries.  Only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are closed Sunday. What ever happened to Sunday funday?   Ps. Mainly outdoor seating, if the weather is not great find somewhere else."

                "description": "Love this little spot.  Awesome beer selection, great food from the station cafe out back, and overall a really really cool concept.  I'm so thankful to have this place within walking distance of my apartment.. Easy place to swing through for a cold one or 2... Or 5.  The two bartenders I've had so far are pretty friendly, but you have to tease the conversation out of them. Overall cool guys who seem to know what they're talking about in terms of the beer.  Another plus is that they play sports games on their tv outside.  Two suggestions:  extend your hours.  Both for the bar and for the food.  I think the demand is there to support it.  Next suggestion, maybe consider increasing the size of the TV.  The small one tucked up in the window is charming, but I feel a larger tv with better sound could attract a bigger crowd.  Very cool spot with great beers and a super chill vibe.  One of my favorite King William hang outs.  Will be a regular here for sure.  Cheers!"

                "description": "The Filing station is great buut when combined with the little restaurant owned by the same place next door it's awesome! Very low key hipsterish, lots of bicyclist and soccer fans (outside TV) .  This place has a tiny little indoor bar with a lot of great beer. They have an extensive outdoor seating area between the bar building and their sister restaurant which has some super affordable, super delicious food. The pizza is good, the sandwiches are grand. I have never had a bad sandwich but I have regretted when I didn't get something with aoli knowing that I could have enjoyed that deliciousness. Dog friendly. Big bonus for me is that they always have my favorite local (if Blanco counts as local) beer, Devil's Backbone, I don't think there should be a bar in SA that doesn't carry this delicious, reasonably priced gem."

                "description": "My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now but they are only open Monday - Friday.  We finally made it there on our Friday night date night after hearing they had tapped a keg of Real Ale Sisyphus that had been sitting over a year.  Um, Yes please!!!    We were delighted to find it was true and received our pour.  The place is very tiny but there is outdoor seating.  It was pretty packed when we got there and most outdoor seating was taken.  We stood off to the side and within a minute two guys waived us over and said we could sit with them -- cool people, yes!  We enjoyed our beers and made some new friends.     We heard the restaurant side is outstanding and makes some pretty good grub.  You can take the food over to the bar side and we saw some sandwiches/pizza that did look appetizing.   However, it was all about our Sisyphus on this night.  Thank you Filling Station for surprising us with one of our favorite beers out of no where!  That is some good beer management there!   We would be back more if they were open on weekends but we will get what we can take.  We definitely return."

                "description": "One of the more distinct beer bars I've visited in my day, built in a converted gas station that probably had its heyday in the 50s.   The space is rather cramped, with maybe 5 seats inside pressed against the bar and a small opening for the standing crowd. It's intimate and I could tell that most people were familiar with one another.   The server was polite and friendly and didn't have a problem with allowing me to sample a few beers.   As is usually the case, I was on a stakeout for some local/Texas beer and only found a few on tap when I visited, although the tap graveyard they keep reflects that plenty of Texas craft makes its way to this establishment. The rest of the lineup was craft beer from around the country, which is normally cool, but for a New Mexican, seeing Dale's Pale Ale and Deschutes Black Butte is pretty common, so this was a slight disappointment. It's not you, Filling Station, it's me. I need new; I need variety.  Ahh, variety, that reminds me. This place definitely has a thing for hoppy beers. There were a great number of IPAs and Pale Ales on tap, which again is cool by me, but kind of works against the whole new and variety necessities I just mentioned. Again, it's not you guys, it's me.  The one thing I can say is you is the whole plastic cups thing. I'm not a fan. I noticed it's a small space and there's probably no room to wash glasses and such, but I really dislike drinking beer out of plastic cups.   Anyhow, overall a good place to grab a beer or two, so let me emphasize that."

                "description": "Beer galore in a former gas station?  Win.  So unique.  Will you be crammed in like sardines trying to get to the bar during a Friday evening right after work ? Yes.  Is the beer selection worth it? Absolutely.  Also sweet about this place is that the station cafe right next door will bring food over to you if you want to sit on the little patio area right outside the bar itself.  I had one unpleasant bartender which was kind of off-putting a while back, but other than that, the service has always been really inviting and friendly.  Prices are fair, location is awesome, and the unassuming exterior make for an excellent stop if you're in the mood for a quick and super casual beer.  Highly recommend!"

The jam that comes with the charcuterie plate was sooooo goos so I got a jar for $10 to go. Highly recommend to try the Sugar Cane Lamp. Not the best at describing but it is delicious lol  Got a Honey Boy with half shot of vodka  The server was very nice and professional. He checked up on us couple times and made sure everything was good."

                "description": "Bottom line up front: I can't believe they have the gall to charge what they do for disappointing and inedible dishes. DO NOT ORDER the charcuterie board. As a matter of fact, DO NOT waste your money here.  Probably the ugliest bunless burger you'll ever see, and it is accompanied with really weird tasting and textured American cheese. For an upscale place like Cured where we paid over $100 for LUNCH, you'd think it would come with gourmet cheeses instead of standard cheap American cheese but I wanted to trust the chef and so I (regretfully) ordered it anyway. The patty was small and overcooked. To come with no fixings and no condiments other than ketchup, is bold and confident, however unfortunately so at a major disappoinment. The confidence lacks self awareness. Just like the charcuterie board. A handful pieces of decent, not mind blowing, meats . Of the two jams was extremely bitter and inedible, to include one of the two mustard seeds, and the ginger infused pickles. So 50% of the board meh and the other 50% down right bitter and unappetizing. I couldn't believe the price they were charging for that junk. My spouse got the lamb, which was fine but the snap peas were soooo oily and way over seasoned! We couldn't even finish it. And the polenta was straight up bland. What is going on here?!  Our celebratory lunch was ruined!! I seriously still can't believe they have the audacity to charge $100. I can't believe I'm saying this but I'd much rather go to a mediocre chain restaurant and spend $100 than spend $20 at Cured.  Anyway, if I have anything positive to say it's that the service was great."

We  ordered fried Quail legs from the Happy Hour menu which was crispy and well seasoned.  We also had charcuterie board as a starter and everything on the board were paired together for maximum tasting experience.  For dinner we had Sunday supper fried chicken dinner.  The chicken was moist, tender, and super tasty.  It came with grits, cornbread, and collards which made the meal a total southern comfort food experience.  Our server took great care of our party ensuring our drinks were refreshed and returned to check on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Overall we enjoyed ourselves here while visiting from Charlotte NC."

                "description": "Just had a terrific dining experience at Cured! I'm really not sure what they could do to not earn 5 stars! We started with the reserve charcuterie plate. Among the favorites were pork butter, smoked duck ham, jalapeÃ±o pork rillettes, and 30 day bresaola. For an entree, we shared the 30 day dry aged ribeye. We ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.   After dinner (and with very little room left in my stomach) we order the bread pudding. It was delicious. I've had lots of bread pudding in my lifetime and this easily ranked towards the top of the list.   The service was wonderful and we made friends at the table next to us. The manager saw us having a good time and came by to pour our combined group a round of complimentary wine. That really helped solidify a wonderful experience."

                "description": "The Pearl is one of those great places with a variety of restaurants, shops, coffee spots and wine bars. Unfortunately, they are hit or miss. I guess the feeling is the area sells itself and, it does, but the food should decidedly be a part of that sell. This was the case for Cured.  I really wanted to like Cured. It was a different concept and had some interesting looking plates. The location, as mentioned, was outstanding and the restaurant itself had plenty of seating. But that was all it had to offer. The happy hour was minute, and they only offered quail legs as a HH food. These were .50c during happy hour, so the price was not bad at all, but that was the only happy hour food offering, which is quite meager for a HH menu.  As a meal, my friends and I shared the Cheese Plate for $30. This was already too pricey for a platter with only three cheese selections. We had to add their Foie Gras and Summer Sausage for $8.00 each to have some meats in the platter. At the waiter's recommendation, we included an order of four HH quail legs and two bottles of their punch special for $20 each.  Overall, service was pretty good. The waiter was attentive and kept the drink servings going, so the issue was never the service. But, other than location, that is all that Cured had to offer. The prices were too high and the food underwhelming. The pate was tasteless, and I was not impressed with the summer sausage. I did like the quail legs, but I wish they were meatier. Even the punch got cloyingly sweet after the first glass.  I know that charcuterie plates tend to be pricey, but with only three cheese selections, more cheese was needed, at least, more charcuterie board selections. Ultimately, I felt that Cured was not worth it and, quite frankly, there are too many places in the Pearl that can give them a run for their money."

                "description": "Disclaimer: I can only speak to the happy hour menu (which surprisingly also happens on saturdays!)  The patio punch is a rum-based drink with lemonade and blueberry flavoring and was delicious! The cost was $20 and could be shared well with 4 people. The drink wasn't overpowered with the taste of the rum and I'd definitely return for this drink again.  The quail legs were amazing. The meat was tender and the outside breading was very tasteful. The legs were topped with honey and rosemary and came at 50 cents a piece. They are an amazing light snack and I'd highly recommend you give them a try."

Excellent vibes for small group dinner or grabbing drinks for a date. The staff is very friendly and helpful at explaining the menu. We opted for some cocktails, although they have an excellent beer list too. We decided to try the two charcuterie boards, both the meat and cheese platter. Everything was excellent and it was fun for our group to try new things. Note that you can ask for additional bread free of charge :) We absolutely loved this place and the area is cool too. I'll definitely come back."

This place is the type of place that will encourage you to try things out of your comfort zone and you'll be glad you did.   The charcuterie boards are unmatched. They are authentic and not the trends we've seen lately. Wedge salad was good, blue cheese was a bit strong for my taste, but my date enjoyed it. The fried oyster sandwich is something I've never seen before, it was however delicious! Drinks are strong, so you'll get your moneys worth.   Great place to have dinner at the pearl, perfect for a date!"

The first time, we came for happy hour and the quail legs were exceptional! This time, we came for dinner and I was underwhelmed. The meat and cheese plates were very tasty with a nice variety of selections. However, our dinners were very heavy handed on the black pepper, especially the shrimp (of the shrimp and grits) and acorn squash (paired with my filet). My other half quite enjoyed his shrimp and grits, but everything was too spicy for me unfortunately. Moving forward, I think we will stick to happy hour!"

                "description": "I'd read that this is a \"must-do\" restaurant, not just in San Antonio, but in TEXAS. I can easily see how Cured made it on that short list and has been dubbed \"the gem of the Pearl district.\"  Located in what was once the administrative building of the Pearl brewery, the design and finishes pay homage to the original structure, which was built in 1904. Much of the original integrity remain, and everything about the architecture, from the open beamed ceilings to the roughly painted brick feels beautifully intentional yet humbly authentic.  But the real star of cured is that charcuterie. In fact, compared to these house-made offerings, any other restaurants that offer cliched store-bought prosciutto and salami should be embarrassed to slap the \"charcuterie\" label on it. This is the real deal: house-made rilletes, chicken liver mousse, and smoke duck breast are divine in their own right yet are further elevated by their accoutrements, which they make and sell by the jar.  We tried the dry-aged ribeye and wedge salad as well and were too stuffed to finish it all in the end.  Bottom line: every foodie who visits San Antonio would be remiss if they didn't visit Cured. And checking out the Pearl district without visiting Cured would be a crime against all things foodie"

The charcuterie plates were overpriced for the amount of cheese and meat received. Would not recommend. The heritage hog poutine dish was drenched in oil and made our stomachs uneasy. The braised lamb dish was not good at all, as it was compressed, too salty, and did not taste fresh.   The chicken fried livers were good, and the Cobb salad was fine. The mussels were good.   While the food was not appetizing, the service was good for the most part."

                "description": "The ambiance of this place is great! I took my wife here for a nice celebratory dinner and it was a really cute spot at the pearl. We started off with a charcuterie board and two entrees. The charcuterie board was good but it wasn't really what I was expecting. Very fancy for sure but the different spreadable meats were kind of odd. I think I prefer a more standard charcuterie board with regular meats cheeses and crackers/bread. We got the burger and the BOT. Both were terrific. The burger was a little small but very tasty and fried oysters were very good! I really did enjoy the experience it just seemed a little pricey especially the charcuterie board and the kitchen seemed under staffed or something bc it took a long time to get the food. Our waitress was terrific so it was still a terrific experience.   Overall: 4.41 stars"

I have a very high intolerance to sulfites (which can be a complicated problem at a place specializing in cured foods), and both the chef and my waitress took excellent care of me. The chef took time to point out every single thing on the menu that I couldn't consume that day, which was truly special.   The wedge salad was phenomenal, as was the cheese plate. The staff member that took the time to describe each item on the cheese plate was very passionate about food, and was as sweet as could be. It was fun to try a bunch of combinations that I had never really considered, before.   I had the poutine for my meal, and it was honestly a culinary masterpiece. From using a small cast iron skillet to keep the fries crispy on the bottom, to using the pickled cauliflower as needed pops of acid to cut through the heavy fattiness of the pork, cheese, and gravy...it was a foodie's dream!   I would come back to Cured in a heartbeat, and the prices were honestly amazing for the experience and food that you receive. Definitely check it out!"

There are a number of places in that area, and Callum's caught my eye in my Yelp search.  I'd heard enough about them through a FB group, so we decided to give them a try.  Man, what a good decision!  My wife ordered the San Antonio hot sandwich, and I got a large order of the boneless San Antonio hot.  I also ordered the cheese fries.  The heat of the chicken is no joke, but the flavours are fanTAStic.  And the portions are filling - my wife couldn't quite finish the sandwich, and I chose to take a good amount of the boneless home, since I knew that would travel better than the fries, so I finished the fries there.  It was a little pricey, but over-sizing my boneless order didn't help.  And again, everything was so good, and I've got some to eat later at home, so it all works out.  You have a number of choices in the St Mary's area, but you should make a point of hitting this place."

We sampled the deviled eggs (super chilled and super creamy, might have been a tad improved with some salt), the OG chicken (a stunningly good sammich) and the vegan chicken (a slab of fried gold -- tofu, that is). Both sammiches were slathered with neon sauce, which was some bright green poppyseed deliciousness. We ate outside at the white picnic tables and had a lovely alfresco dinner. There are many things left to try; we will be back!"

                "description": "The reason for 3 stars is mainly the pricing. I think it's a bit much to pay ~$20 for 6 wings that were good... but not that good. If they changed their pricing, then this place is pretty decent and worth checking out. It's small inside but they do offer outdoor seating which is nice. You do order your food at the front and they bring your food out to you.   We had ordered Tyme fries, San Antonio hot wings, and their chicken sandwich. The fries were crispy and full of flavor. Wings were pretty spicy in my opinion so I didn't enjoy it very much; it was also on the oily side due to the spices. Their chicken sandwich was very tasty and cooked to perfection. Their Gucci ranch is pretty good (and I would get this if you're ordering their hot wings... you'll need it).   They don't have a private parking lot so it's mainly street parking which wasn't so bad since it wasn't super busy."

Just quirky, delicious and they do what they do very, very well.. Folks order up at the counter or order ahead and they bring the food out to you. There's a cute patio dining area and more places to sit inside.   The chicken itself is remarkable and the sandwich was perfectly done. The balance of crunch and juice was perfect. It was maybe the messiest, most crunchiest, 5 mins I've had this year. The fried egg was clutch!   We chose the Garlic and Thyme for the Brown Bag Fried Chicken and Fries   Was hoping for more chicken but what we had was actually some of THE best fried chicken we've ever had.    GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS CHICKEN!   Been here before? What did you get?"

We got the Girls Thyme Fries, bologna sandwich, and the wings. The fries were so good and crispy, great flavor! I'd get an order for each person because the large was still a little small for 2. The wings are spicy!! Very good but prepared for spicy. Ranch sauce is a must with fries or wings. The bologna sandwich was good but wish the bread was different or toasty.   Overall, it's a good spot and a nice place for a bit to east anytime but night is the best vibe."

                "description": "Atta YES! I love this place. They are known for their chicken and have a tiny menu, but they have one veganish entree. It's called the vegan-ish job and it is AWESOME. It's fried tofu on a bun, and it is straight up delicious. I think the bun has honey on it, so it's not really vegan, hence the name. And the last time we were here, my bf added a fried egg to his veganish job, which made it even less vegan, but it was a very nice addition. I do recommend that combo. All the sides we have tried here have been winners as well - disco fries, creamed corn, and their gucci goat salad. Yummy! They also have a nice little variety of craft beers on tap. And the workers are very friendly. But the best part of this place is the veganish job. I don't often advocate for places with only one vegetarian option, but this one is too good to pass up. It's a small spot with indoor and outdoor seating, but totally worth the stop. And they know that they don't have a sign. Come in and grab a sandwich and beer and have a great food experience."

I had the same thing both times, the OG chicken sandwich. The most recent time the chicken was fried so long it was tough. This made it hard to eat as a sandwich. I finally submitted and tried to use the spork they gave me but that was worse. It would bend each time I tried to stab the chicken. We wanted to sit outside because it was a nice day but the flies were literally swarming us. It was a constant struggle to keep them away. I know this is a natural consequence to sitting outside but there was also a large trash can in the immediate area that wasn't helping the situation."

Like jumping into the deep end and remembering you can't swim style...in over my head! Like I don't really remember anything 10 minutes before or after I ate it type of hot! I don't blame Cullum's or the sandwich, I blame my wimpy-ass mouth for failing me! Lots of foods say they are hot and I never even give it a second thought, but this one is pretty damn spicy...GOOD but you are gonna feel it for a bit.  The Buffalo Chicken is more for people with sensitive to extreme heat...like me, sadly. It is really good. I got a bite of one just as my tongue came back to life after the San Antonio Hot and it was about as tasty a chicken sammich as you're gonna find. Look at the pic! The damn thing is beautiful!  Get over there an check them out for anything chicken.  See more on IG @cheatday_SA"

It didn't sound right, but I tried their PBandJ wings (yes, peanut butter and jelly), and they were nothing like I was imagining, and I was imagining something strange, but THEY ARE SOOOO WORTH IT! They blew my mind!  The Nashville Hot wings are spicy and I can swear I taste a hint of chipotle pepper, but I can't be certain. These wings are a definite repeat order.  Every wing or wing sauce I tried was really good. I've been here 3 times during my vacation here in San Antonio. It will take my broken legs to keeping me from coming back here at least one more time before I head back home!"

They have 2 quarter pool tables that you can hang out and enjoy a friendly game.  The bartender was so helpful when I didn't know what I wanted to drink and her recommendation of Deep Eddy Lemon and cranberry juice is a new favorite now!  She was the only one working, but no one went without a drink and she had a friendly smile for everyone."

They are taking the Covid situation very serious, and are maintaining a clean, yet still fun environment.  We had an amazing time this last visit, but had a slight computer glitch at the end of the night effecting our bill.  Tricia (the GM) contacted me back right away, and was super helpful!

The Stout House bar has many craft brews to choose from with an amazing selections of coctails. If you don't know what to drink ask one of the bartenders to make something that fit your sweet or sour pallet. The staff is friendly, approachable with an amazing \"Bloody Marry Bar\" on Sundays. It's clean, well kept, and you can play pool or darts at your leisure. They are always throwing different events throughout the weekday. If you are looking for a good time; come out and visit the Stout House in Helotes, you will not be disappointed."

The service from Kayhla more than made up for the lack of craft beers. He vibe is chill. You can watch sports without sound if you like that. No food but a pizza joint next door and you can bring you beer over. I will be back."

                "description": "I have sort of followed this place off yelp since it first opened but never actually made it out because of the reviews. We were invited out so we gave it a shot.   First you walk in and the first thing that hits you is the smell of old stale beer Oh you know the smell- it's that sour, no one has cleaned the bar mats correctly kinda smell. Then your eyes adjust and you are like hmmm,  for a place that is fairly new and in the outskirts of Helotes this place is really run down. Not like shabby cool- just like cardboard boxes on top of an open area., close to the ceiling - may be a fire hazard - but more like scary walk to the restroom kinda place. I actually saw a staff member clean the wood top table with Fabuloso and the stench permeated for some time- just what  I want when trying l to enjoy a drink...... when you look around you see the obligatory beer signs but then you also note that there are a bunch of advertisements for upcoming events. Like too too many that it makes the walls look littered.   With the word \"stout\" in the name of the place one expects to have lots of different kinds of microbrews. Sure they have one descheutes stout and one elisyan and maybe 2-3  but other taps are your big corp, beer (bud, Miller, etc).  They do have full bar options. Moscow mules served in copper mugs though ginger beer was flat.   There is no food in the joint but I saw several patrons walk in with pizza boxes from the place next door.   The crowd was loud, obnoxiously loud. Not sure how many decibels this places hits but it must be ridiculously high- my ears were buzzing.    Crowd- A little to old to be taking shots at 6pm but hey whatever. Appeared that highs school football parents and grandparents were getting ready for the season. The cont shrieking if one patron was enough to push is out of the place.   That was our experience, so now how about sharing yours?"

Loved the atmosphere. Would have given 5 stars but after the guy got off shift a girl went on shift and she had the worst attitude. Super rude to us and told us we needed to be careful how much we drank. We had only had the one drink a piece and babied it for a good while. I understand not over serving... but she was just ridiculous and barely gave us a beer. So because she had such an attitude we didn't even finish our beer we just left."

Their quick service and kind words have always made me feel important and cherished by the crew that mans the bar. Their music is ran by a jukebox, but thank Jesus the people who attend there have stellar taste in music so you'll groove all night long. An outdoor patio greets you warmly and their specials are consistent too. Easy place to chill for hours.   **The girl bartender was rude once a while back without justification, but to avoid any negative feelings about Stout House I ask for drinks from the guys behind the bar."

Our bartendress was awesome, the drinks were quick and the environment was chill. There were lots of open seats; I don't know how to explain it - inside setup looks like picnic-type high bar tables everywhere, Lol! Forgive me, I don't even know if that's typical. Just something I've seen for the first time. There is also a patio outside.   Location is great! There is a pizza place next door, cupcake shop close by and a Silverado movie theater within walking distance. No issues with parking. A great hangout spot to stop by before or after a movie, shoot some darts, play beer pong and get a few drinks.  Only downsides are I had a Long Island and a Pineapple Rum and didn't get a buzz (usually I'm good with just a Long Island), and they don't serve any food/appetizers (NADA). So, great hangout place, but not for strong drinks or snacking ;)"

I do love the remodel they did and how there is a ton more space, but that does not supersede the management and service you will receive.  This last visit was the last time I will be going to Bar America. I had some friends in town and I wanted them to enjoy a nice Sunday Funday while avoiding the Texas heat. Every other time except this last time, minors have been allowed. We were trying to be responsible and we brought a 20 yr old that does not/ will not drink, to hang out and drive us all home safely. Well the 'manager' came over and let us know that we will have to go because \"they do not allow anyone in the bar that is 18, 19 or 20 because of they could be drinking and its a TABC violation\".  I could go on and on about the other times that have been similarly awful, but I will sum it up to.... rude management/ staff and there a ton of other better places to go.

It's a perfect spot to watch the games since they have multiple screens.   You have to stand in line to order, not like other bars where you can stand anywhere to order so just keep that in mind if you haven't been. Theres the rooftop view as well with some nice photo ops.   The music and vibe is spot on and the service is pretty good, well rounded spot you make have to wait a little longer on game days but that's everywhere."

They have inside and outside seating with a cool upstairs area where you have a good view of the tower.  The bartenders are fast. They have many drink options.  We rented an area for a birthday party and everything went as planned. FYI if you are bringing a gift, make sure it is not alcohol because they won't let you take it in.  Parking can be a pain. It is street parking."

                "description": "I really enjoy it here! Been twice.. once on a random night of the week. Decent crowd, super friendly bar staff both times. The second visit was on a Sunday for brunch and to watch football. Again. Super friendly bar staff, and they are super quick and efficient. Probably the fastest moving bar staff I've seen in a while, considering the amount of people they're serving.   My friend got me hooked onto their pickle and chamoy shots! Holy guacamole, my mouth is watering just thinking about them!   On Sunday's they open at noon, and they do have a brunch menu which includes wings, chicken and waffles, brisket migas, breakfast sandwich and my favorite the chorizo and cheese tots! The price point is excellent. The tots are big enough to share. There was 2 of us and we shared brisket migas and the tots. And it was plenty of food. The tots were LOADED with chorizo, and it was god quality chorizo, and the tots were fried crisp! Not soggy or soft at all! It was perfect!   They offer $10 mimosa set ups, too! A bottle of champs and either cranberry, orange or pineapple juice. There are a lot of drink specials offered daily, even during Sunday brunch. There is a patio, and a rooftop bar as well. Ample amounts of tables and bar stools all over the bar, plenty of TVs. And on Sunday, after the game, there was a DJ! So it's the perfect spot for a Sunday funday.   Parking can be hard, but you can park right down, less than a 5 minute walk in the school district parking lot, behind Batallion.   Definitely going to have to come back for their brunch!!"

I'm moderately tattooed but that specific one didn't pass their judgment. For an establishment that sells lone star and lone star light this is completely ridiculous. Do y'all know what state y'all are located in? Take your money and beer drinking elsewhere. Skip this lame place.  Brian, you must have me confused with another patron. My wife was not with me, or has posted a review (she's not even on yelp) my mom hasn't contacted you and I do not have a 210 tattoo anywhere on my body. Y'all should try and adjust your 'dress code' y'all sell Texas beer for crying out loud."

                "description": "Went here on Sunday to watch the Brazil vs. Switzerland game.  Got there just as they opened (shocked they didn't open for the earlier Mexico vs. Germany game, which would have been a better view of the TV over Francis Bogside).  We got 4 chairs at the bar and enjoyed the food selection and the $2 Modelo drafts and $3 well tequila shots.   Atmosphere - Relaxed open space that has a number of tables and benches with tons of TV's around the outside wall.  DJ Tony Phoenix (https://www.facebook.com/DJTonyPhx/) was spinning some great tunes as the crowd enjoyed their Sunday afternoon.  Place was packed and I was told it was like that most Sundays.    Food/Drinks - The drink specials are great here as I saw a number of Mimosa sets going out of the bar.  Our party got the fish tacos and the chorizo with taters that was plenty of food.  Next time I am going with the chicken and waffle option that seemed to be the most popular item ordered.    Service -All food and drinks are ordered at the bar, so they are attentive and make sure everyone has food and drinks.  Kept the bar clean and highly enjoyed our bartenders that were nice and spent time chatting with us.  They work really hard.  Overall - Check this place out.  Good food and drinks, great service, and perfect location off the River Walk."

                "description": "***Delete if not allowed*** I know this place serves food, but we have never been there for it. After last night it is doubtful we ever will be.   We took a Lyft from the Pearl, 9 of us, to go to Bar America last night. Previously we have had a lot of fun and the DJ was good when we were there. We arrived before half our party and paid $20 for 4 of is to get in. Apparently they have a cover charge now, no big deal we are used to that in Chicago.   We go order drinks and wait for the rest to arrive. They are immediately turned away at the door, not because they are busy, but because one friend is 24. Yes, twenty four. We asked to speak with a manager and are told that just last night they started implementing a 25 and up rule. Why? Because of the shooting they had outside the bar in September? I'm sorry but you are just now implementing this????  We decided we werent staying and maybe had been there all of 10 minutes, including the time spent talking to the manager. Because of this new found rule we asked for our cover charge back. I didn't think it was too much to ask given we had just arrived. The manager refused. We paid $20 to hear a crappy DJ play one song.  Now, I get that the shooting most definitely had a negative impact on their business. But if you are going to alienate your biggest clientele (21-24) you probably shouldn't be operating as a bar. Stick to food and close at 11 like other restaurants. Don't advertise that you have a DJ and turn people away at the door. People who are of legal drinking age. As you can see the place was dead at 10:30 last night.   But good came out of it. We went right down the road to Jokesters. Never heard of the place before but after taking a Lyft across town we wanted something close. The doorman laughed when we asked if we were too young, apparently they were aware of the new rule and were getting all the clientele Bar America wouldn't let in. They were packed, service was fast and the DJ was awesome. He played current and all of the 80s and 90s favorites. We definitely will go back there."

Newly renovated exposed brick and finished hardwood interior and rooftop deck are classy and awesome, and a good selection of reasonably-priced spirits, beers, and cocktails to choose from.  Haven't tried the food, but I heard it's pretty good.  There was a hip DJ there last night, and they brought back the pool table thank God!  It's just about the only pool table in Southtown when you're looking to satisfy the need for a clean break, some neat clicks, and feel the gratification of a fine shot dropping into the pocket.  Back patio is currently being finished up at the time of posting (Feb '20) in conjunction with another welcomed coffee shop establishment.  Undoubtedly will be fantastic once it's fully open to everyone's enjoyment.  View from the rooftop to the downtown skyline should be spectacular!"

By the time you find the bottom, you're problems will seem further away. The pickle chips are crisp, well battered, and savory. The pretzel was a little heavy on the salt, but the beer cheese is perfectly balanced to bring out the creaminess of the cheese and the sweet malt of the beer.   Dog friendly patio is a nice touch. The service was good and I get the prices were fair for the massive drink portion size you receive."

Now I have not been into this establishment yet but I plan on it since I am new to the area and it looks super cute, I often browse Yelp to find great places to try out. I stumbled upon this place and went to read my first review. Someone made a review about this place regarding a bartender touching her hair in the bathroom, and how another waiter was talking over there food on their table. I just want to say *because I'm totally irked by those comments* if you choose to dine out at a public establishment - that is your choice. Confronting someone in the bathroom about them adjusting their features (which is definitely \"an invasion of space\" but lets talk about social distancing, right? LOL) These workers are working to provide a great experience for you as the customer. If you are scared of being out in public and someone coming to close of contact with your food (even though you're out in public ordering food at a public restaurant that has to be cooked by other people, assorted by other people, and served by other people) then you should order takeout! If your main goal is to go out to eat and criticize normal human beings for being themselves and trying their best to show up everyday, then hit the road, JACK!   Anyway, I can't wait to stop by this place as it looks very cool. Peace!"

We got there and the parking lot was full so naturally being social butterfly that I am I'm like shit!  So we walk in and it's dead should have taken that as a red flag. So we sat down had some pretty decent service at first my kid ordered the kids burger and she barely touched so I took a bite after while of her not touching it and figured out why it was flavorless so no more mystery there. The wife and I ordered some beers we wanted to try and everything we wanted was out which was a bummer but we settled on one and it was cold and did the trick for the time being, and then we decided to order the cheese and sausage board and when it showed up we weren't impressed it looked like the cheese had been sitting out for a few hours and the sausage was cold, and from one peace to the other it tasted all the same they just tried to present it nicely, I wished I had taken a picture but my bad. So to make a long story endless the good was the beer was cold the bad was everything else. We won't be back."

It has a spacy outside area; the drinks and food are favorable, and the service was excellent. The location also can't be beat. It is across from the Quarry and a couple of blocks away from pretty Alamo Heights, which is definite plus. All in all, a perfect place to sit and enjoy, especially with the cooler weather upon us.  We all ordered the Wurst plate which comes with three types of sausage, a bit of sauerkraut, and two choices of sides. In my case, I ordered the sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. Everything on the plate was well-prepared and the portion was large enough for a second meal of leftovers. Our young waitress was new but handled the service like a pro and was very attentive.  This is a place that I could visit and have, over and over. It is not too pricy, comfortable atmosphere, tasty food/drinks and awesome service. It hits all marks. Really, there isn't much not to like in this place. Absolutely recommend it for an after-Quarry visit."

It really deserves a 2 star rating but here's why I gave it 3... they still have the best variety and best Dos-A-Ritas in San Antonio.  One of the best outdoor beer gardens in SA.  But, last night was our first visit since the renovation (If I remember right I had given them a 4 star review prior to their Reno).  Here is why it was a 2: Boiled down to customer service.  The hostess was not even close to being pleasant.  We were on a date night and I asked to be seated outside so we can enjoy the music and some drinks near the stage.  So she tries to sit me as a far away as possible in the corner area with a peekaboo view of life.  I did tell her [again] I would prefer to be seated near the stage and pointed out all the empty tables.    Our waiter was great, friendly, and his bright personality made up for the poor experience we had received so far.  The margaritas were still as amazing as I remembered them.  We ordered appetizers.  My wife loves the fried pickles from here and they didn't disappoint.  I normally would order their Cheese and Sausage board but I ordered the Wurtzel by mistake.  When the Wurtzel came it actually Looked really good so I kept it.  First bite in and the middle of the pretzel was cold as was the sausage (so gross).  Not to mention the lady who brought them over plopped them on the table and left (another grumpy employee).  Here's the thing, it wasn't even that busy.  Makes you wonder why... since they have one of the nicest outdoor seating areas with a stage and live music in that area.  The weather was beautiful and not as hot as it typically gets during this time of year.  Back to my point, it wasn't busy so why was the overall service so poor?   Even though the band sounded great, a couple of mosquito bites into the evening we decided to leave and try somewhere else.  Shout out to the Nathan Lugo Band! We only stayed as long as we did because y'all sounded great.  After their renovation it offers much more of a family vibe with an outdoor play area for kids, relaxed seating areas, and just gorgeous patio and beer garden.   We used to absolutely love coming here it was one of our favorite spots for a date night and to bring friends/family for large groups.  Hopefully the owners select a competent manager and take a hard look at their customer service."

The bratwurst sausage was tasty, the pretzel had great flavor. My daughter said the brisket enchiladas were good and the beer garden was very nice as well as the patio.  The grilled asparagus with butter were superb. I recommend this restaurant. Social distancing was in place and staff wore masks."

Our server Johnny was awesome taking care of business.  Also shout out to Meagan one of the bussers , she was doing her thing bussing a table but made sure we were getting taken care of.  Stopped by our table to see if we needed anything.  Afterwards met with Joe the manager and felt like a VIP.  Stop by and visit.  I highly recommend it.  We look forward to going back."

The Irish Drop Shot and the Reverse Irish Drop Shot. The Irish Drop Shot was a delicious drink with some sweetness to it. It's the perfect amount of sweetnes. The Reverse Irish Drop Shot wasn't as sweet. I will recommend the Irish Drop Shot. The service was great. I never felt neglected. I will be back again."

                "description": "Their Brisket Nachos are great. Some of their BBQ is solid. The potato salad was unacceptable. I don't think they make their potato salad in house. It tasted like something pre-packaged from a grocery store. We waited over an hour to get our food and the waiter wasn't very apologetic about that. Their drinks are fantastic. The staff needs to step up their game, they weren't very friendly. I would go there again based on a couple of the dishes and drinks. I felt like the staff just happened to be having a bad day the day we were there."

                "description": "This was my first post-quarantine venture into the dining world. All things considered, I think Hofbrau was a good choice. There was a good atmosphere to relax in with good company. Sure, the food took over an hour to arrive, but had I awoken from a 3 month coma when I sat out in the beer garten, the only variation on normality would be the waitstaff's masks.  I felt kinda bad for the harried servers. The joint was jumping. There were very few empty tables, but the live band appeared to have all patrons in good spirits. Speaking of spirits, they took a long time too, but the drinks were strong, so I didn't make a fuss. Food was good quality and hearty,  but a NOTE TO THE TECH-CHALLENGED: At this time you will need a smart phone that reads a QR code to get a menu."

They were great about maintaining social distancing and keeping us safe. Their menu had a wonderful mix of southern, Mexican and German delicacies such as wurtzel (gorgeous large pretzel with dips), cheese and German sausage board, brisket nachos and queso blanco with brisket, salads, sandwiches, and Tex-Mex plates. They have an extensive bar, signature margaritas, good wine selection, and a great selection of local, national and Mexican beers. The patio is absolutely gorgeous, and the service professionals could not have been more helpful, warm, and kind. When we return to San Antonio, which is often, we will have to return to Quarry Hofbrau!"

Tex-Mex and German don't make for very logical fusions.   The mix drinks arnt even well made. Just pre-mixed.   2 stars because if you don't want to wait to have a table you are at the right"

                "description": "I chose to dine alone this evening. I used the Yelp app to help me decide, and Mako's ended up being the perfect location. I made a reservation; it wasn't needed, but I wanted to be on the safe side. I was seated quickly at a high top near the bar where I could still enjoy the peace of dining alone, with the background noise of quiet conversation from others and ESPN playing above the bar.   I'd made it just in time for the Happy Hour specials and decided on a $5 old fashioned and the $5 Gouda ranch wedge ($1 with grilled shrimp1). I added the butternut squash bisque after placing my initial order, and it was the right choice. The funny thing is I can't quite describe what made it tasty, but I cleaned the bowl! The salad was pure perfection...seriously...you canNOT go wrong. I'm not sure if it was the tangy pickled onion, the smoky lardon bacon,  or the perfectly grilled shrimp that made the salad so scrumptious, but I'm already planning my next visit for that one item alone.   Since I wasn't stuffed from my satisfying meal, I decided to indulge in dessert. I chose the poached pear with the Portofino wine reduction and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious, but SUPER sweet. So, if you're not into that, pass on this dessert. Even though it's a small dessert, it's perfect to share because it's probably too rich for one person (except me!).   This will not be my last time enjoying happy hour here; I've already text a friend to suggest this as a new monthly get together spot! Next time I'll sit outside!   Side Note: I definitely recommend the \"Smoked\" old fashioned made with star of anise, juniper berry, and mesquite chips. Ask to see a demonstration to add to the overall experience. It was a pure delight. It somehow took a simple $5 cocktail to the next level."

                "description": "I don't usually leave bad reviews, but unfortunately I feel compelled to in this case.  We ordered the butternut squash bisque, scallops, and paella.  Butternut squash bisque was basically flavored oil with some seeds... there was literally a layer of oil on the top when it came out... I still pressed on and gave it a chance though... it tasted ok at best... In general I'm a human vacuum cleaner so I ate the entire thing, but I would not recommend it if you're looking for an actual bisque/soup.  The scallops were tiny and it only came with 3.... The bed of risotto that the scallops were on had a very odd taste... not like an old taste, or like the food was rotten, it was just seasoned horribly. Again I stomached the entire thing, but the portion size was so small that I was done with the entire plate in literally 3-4 bites.... Total rip-off for the $34 price point.   The Paella.... my mom sent it back.. i tried it before she did though and I wouldn't have been able to stomach it. It was absolutely horrible. Terrible flavor, overcooked seafood, odd tasting sausage, and about 1/4 cup of rice... we couldn't even see the rice when the plate first came out because there was so little. Is this shrinkflation or just normal for this place? I have no idea...   I would not normally have even posted this review but.... After we told the server we'd be sending the Paella back, she stopped by the table that the owner was sitting at and let him know... He never came over to talk to us about it.... and when the server came back, she said the kitchen agreed that it was bad LOL. What?   They were nice enough to comp that dish, but again, the owner/manager/whoever never came by to talk to us about it, apologize, ask how everything else was, nothing.... On our way out we walked past the table the owner was sitting at... he said \"sorry about that, have a good one.\" LOL  Never again"

                "description": "\"delusions of grandeur\" is the title of my review. Do NOT go here! Here are the reasons why...  1) There was a $100 steak on the menu and plastic picnic tables to sit on outside.  2) Service was slow with minimal customer. There was an item requested (pirouline) that was never delivered by the wait staff.  3) The kids cheeseburger was the same size as the adult cheeseburger.  4) They provided a \"side salad\" composed of iceberg lettuce.  5) The \"vegetables\" provided on the steak (of which you no explanation was provided on the menu as to identify the cut of meat other than noting that it was an \"angus steak\") were RAW and by my count our table (of which THREE of these dishes were ordered) had 1.5 baby's carrots on average on each plate. When I asked the waitress for more carrots... it took her 20min to let me know that the chef said it would require the chef SO much work to blanch the carrots... At this point my steak was pretty much done and I informed her we would simply NEVER RETURN.  6) The menu was limited.  We will never go back."

We celebrated our anniversary and wanted to experience a place we hadn't been to.  Walking in we were immediately seated.  Wait staff was jovial and attentive.   Our appetizers were very good and filling (we should have only ordered one but couldn't decide between the two) fried Brussels and Levantine trio. Our entrees were equally difficult to choose but ultimately my husband ordered the 1855 beef coulotte, medium rare.  It was cooked exactly how he wanted with red on the center and juices running in every bite.  You could even taste the hint of coffee spice.  The turnips and carrots were prepared in a Marchand de vin sauce, complimented it nicely.  My entree was the chickpea crusted salmon.  I loved every bite!  It had a slight char on the outside but very moist on the inside.  The tomato and eggplant stew it came with also delicious.   Easily a five star restaurant that I'd recommend and plan on returning to."

                "description": "We found this new trendy spot in Cibolo, Texas. The host was very accommodating when we arrived, if you wanted to wear a mask then they wore mask and if you were comfortable and not wearing a mask then they would not wear a mask.  He sat us all down as we were still waiting for three people from our party. Once our full party had arrived, we had to wait. Unfortunately the waitress took over 10 minutes to come to our table to at least offer some water.  Overall our experience was very great! Unfortunately I did not take a lot of pictures because it was my sisters birthday. But I did manage to sneak in a picture of my cheeseburger which was very light. And I don't mean light in a bad way I mean it as in a satisfying way. Must try!   Their cocktails are also very delicious. I had the cucumber margarita cocktail if I'm not mistaken, and it was very light and subtle at the same time. But boozy!   The only part that I was not super happy with was that the waitress mentioned to us that she had ordered a special surprise for my sister which was their almond cake. As a gift from her. So to me that means that the dessert is on them. But surprisingly when I received the ticket the almond cake was on there. I did not feel like I really wanted to argue over the almond cake but as I stated the way she mentioned it to me is that she was covering the cake. So for that reason I did remove one star.  Something that I really liked about this place was the bathroom. As a first time Mama i've noticed that many restaurants don't have a baby changing table. Or if they have a baby changing table it's very dirty. This place had a very awesome baby changing station. They had diapers, they had wipes, they had waste bags. You think of it and they had it!  Thanks To their management for this!   Great place to eat! Enjoy!"

                "description": "Mako's is a really nice restaurant! The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was nicely decorated and had great ambiance. The food and drinks we ordered were delicious. One of the previous reviews mentioned the Aunt Bees Knees being delicious so I decided to try it and it was really good. My wife got the salmon and I ordered the Pork Shoulder. The salmon was delicious (probably not worth $30 but it did taste very good) and the pork shoulder was also very good as well. One thing I will caution in regards to the pork shoulder is that it is very fatty. There was a lot of fat on the sides of the lean pork that added flavor for sure but wasn't very healthy. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were delicious. A lot of good flavor.   We enjoyed our time at Mako especially since the staff was so nice. However, the price was really not worth it. I'm going to give it 5 stars bc there isn't a 4.5 star option and the experience was worth more than a 4 but I don't think I'd be coming back mainly because of the price of the food. It was good though; so if you don't mind paying extra then this is a good spot for date night or to enjoy a nice evening dinner.   Overall: 4.5 stars"

Delicious and creative dishes are always on the menu whether for dinner, lunch, or brunch! I cannot wait for the Bloody Mary Bar to reopen for weekend brunch. If you're lucky, you will get Paul as your server and get to chat with the owner too. Highly recommend this for great dining in the Cibolo/Schertz area!!!!"

                "description": "A three star review is not a bad review, it means it's okay.  This is definitely a nice restaurant and addition to Cibolo.    The customer service was excellent.  Their outdoor seating and live music makes this a great choice for a date night or night out with friends.  The owner met us at the door on our way out to get feedback of our experience.    This could be because of COVID-19 but the seating outdoors consisted mostly of picnic style benches which is not my preference.  It is nice to be able to lean back in your chair, relax and enjoy the environment and live music.    I ordered their steak and it was not what I was expecting, especially for the price.  My steak came already cut and very lightly seasoned.  I did not like it.  I saw pictures on Yelp reviews of their Tomahawk steak and that is what I was expecting.  We did enjoy their wine and craft beer selection.    I might give this another try once restrictions are lifted and will update this review.  But for now it's a 3/5.  Would I recommend it yes but would I rave about it? No."

                "description": "Amazing Food! Mako's is named for the co-owner's call sign in the Airforce as a pilot, how cool is that?   First and foremost, let's talk about the food, it is phenomenal! Chef Kyronn Cordner knows his stuff. We started with salads...my Greek salad was prepared so beautifully and the ingredients handled so delicately, it was a perfect blend of fresh and tasty, and I couldn't eat it fast enough. The wedge salad was inspiring with its blend of ingredients with a perfect combination of savory my husband absolutely loved. For entrees we had the Easter Special of Salmon over eggplant and tomato moussaka and the 44 farms Tri-tip spiced by Ky. Each dish was a perfect blend of flavors and textures. The food here was truly some of the best we have ever been served and all in our backyard of Cibolo!  Let's talk service!   Paul was our server and we were smitten upon meeting him, he took care of us and was on top of our needs the entire night. We were lucky to meet one of the owners, Jackie Peterson. She was delightful and truly grateful for our feedback and patronage. She told us all about her family's journey through the Airforce and settling here, as well as the local resources they use for the food they serve in the restaurant.   We are delighted to have found such a culinary gem in the heart of Cibolo and will be returning very soon!"

Everything from a full serviced bar to barbecue, turkey legs, burgers, gyros, falafels, taquitos, and everything in between.  I got a delicious (huge) chicken gyro; my husband a burger a fries.  Food was prepared quickly and was delicious.  Loved the setting.  Plenty of food.  Not cheap.  With tip I paid $35 for two of us and we only had a can of soda with the food.  Can't wait to bring my son here when he visits me."

We took a look at the food trucks and we weren't craving anything there and not to mention we literally had gyros for lunch. Not knowing you can't bring outside food or drinks we brought seafood. The manger came up to us rudely while we were eating saying \"you guys can't bring outside food or drinks we're trying to make a living here but I will let y'all finish\" but our family members literally spent 200$ dollars here on food and drinks from the food trucks. I understand if we all would of brought it but it was literally just 2 of us and there was 6 of us at the table.I just thought it was very unprofessional how rude the manager came off.Sorry you guys don't offer more varieties. She could of told us in a more polite way but instead ruined the good time we were having. First and last time here."

Don't make the same mistake if you still haven't been here. The collection of food trucks and shops is purely awesome! @thepointpark consists of @holysmokesa @justthedripsatx @cilantromfft @nygrillexpress @thebackporchbar hosted by @beardxican (Noel Rocks). But I became a fan boy when I was able to chat with owner Denise @eclecticsatx. This boss works her butt off to build something very special on Boerne Stage Rd just minutes from @therimsa. I've been meaning to come by but it was a recent post she made that brought me here. The post has since been taken down (I hope she puts it back up) because of worries that it could offend some patrons but I applauded her for expressing herself and the message in general. See, it seems some people don't understand that this is PRIVATE PROPERTY! It's an operational business like any other establishment yet some folks stroll right in with outside food and drinks and then take a table. Like, what?People, these food trucks and businesses on premises are there to serve you, not watch you support other businesses. This should be common sense, but it's not, and Denise is trying to make sure folks know just remember this. Well, I have no problem saying it, \"STOP THAT SHIT!\".  Support these local businesses and come to eat, drink and enjoy what this spot has to offer. That's what what we did. I When you go you MUST try the Texas Twinkies from holysmokesa...like, holy wow! And make sure to chat with Noel when you grab your drink. You can't miss him@and won't forget him. To all my fellow #YelpElite, GET HERE ASAP!"

                "description": "Maybe you know - why is food truck food typically so expensive? There's no overheard like buildings, leases, servers, bussers, Albanian mobsters...what gives???  A few misses here this day! Patroned around 4 PM on a 95 degree Saturday. Not many folks there and that's likely due to the heat and it being between peak dining times. Lots of shady seating though and thankful that the music they play isn't ear-piercingly loud.   The first truck (Gus' Colombian Cuisine) we wanted to order from was closed. Lights were on, window was open, but no one was home. We stood there for a minute like doofuses since there wasn't a sign saying he was gone or when he'd be back. Strike 1.   So, we decided to try a shrimp and lobster roll from Curb. Informed out of brioche rolls so cannot make that item. Strike 2. Settled on a shrimp and lobster club sandwich or whatever it's called. It was good but $19 good? I don't know about that. Plus, there's no discount for paying with cash instead of cc. The other trucks offer that.  Got an order of 5 egg rolls from the Pho truck for $6. That guy gets around and never disappoints. Rolls were hot and crispy! Great value!  Checked in on Yelp and got a free non-alcoholic drink at the bar - a big glass bottle Coke! There's a cooler on the bar for free water, which was nice. Those were pluses. They have some fans blowing and skeeter spray on some of the tables. The kids liked the play structure and basketball hoop. $4 small lime snocones hurt the wallet, but the kids liked them.   Since they didn't earn a third strike, we'll probably revisit when the weather is cooler and closer to lunch or dinner when all the trucks are open and hopefully fully stocked. If it's sold out, then please indicate that on the menu with a sticker or a magnet. If you're closed, then please put out a sign and say when you'll be back. Easy fixes that keep people informed (and happy) before they try to order."

I had the soft shell crab BLT. The boyfriend thought it was a tad bit fishy, but enjoyed it and felt it was pretty filling.   The bar has a good selection of beers. The bartenders are fast and friendly. In the opposite direction of the bar, you will find a playground for those with children. On a Saturday night, they had live music which added to the laid back atmosphere. For those that have dogs, they are welcomed. Onsite parking is available, but it can get crowded."

Those empanadas are legit delicious. Local artwork adorns the eclectic walls. It's simply a place I would love to spend time in.   Don't be fooled by the low key exterior or the industrial neighbors, this place is legit and we will be returning to see it take on its night time persona. Super excited to return to introduce the hubby to Yuengling now that it's finally available outside the Northeast. This place is exactly what we needed today."

As far as I know,  Tandem is the only place in town that brews espresso with Dark Matter, or that you can find DM beans to purchase. Happy happy happy!!  In addition to just destination coffee,, Tandem is right on the Mission Reach of the Greenway, near Confluence Park. Convenient stop-off from a bike ride or hound walk for a beer (they have 12ish really nice taps, and a selection of cans too). Huge dog-friendly yard with giant beer pong set up. Across the street from an art school - awesome works for sale on Tandem's walls. Great periodic events listed on their socials.  A half-mile from South BBQ - picking up to-go lunch at South and a coffee at Tandem is my favourite Sunday brunch!"

Each time I've gone, in recent time, there's been a different employee working the counter but each experience has been great!!  Coffee brand is delicious and I couldn't wait to take my wife; did so this past weekend finally.   Inside decor is cool and hip.  Outside patio and garden are spacious, various seating and colorful. There's also a few fire pits throughout the grassy area, trash can beer pong and the WiFi reaches the entire patio without an issue.    Haven't tried the food yet and the beer selection is okay. Hope the rotate the taps frequently.   Really hope this COVID doesn't claim this spot!!!"

Their signature coffee drinks are delicious and potent. Try the \"Jefa\", it's stellar! The service is great, very clean and you feel safe as cdc protocols are followed closely. Their beer selection is impressive. The patio is great, there is plenty of seating. My 4 year old loves to grab a hot chocolate and run around the outdoor seating area. Dogs are welcome! Feels like home."

The snack selection is great and the beer and wine menu is as well but I don't drink so I like that there is coffee there too a lot. The bartenders/baristas are also the best!

If you're local, what a great date to ride along the trail, stop for a beer and a snack or bring your kids and enjoy a Texas cola in the afternoon and warm cozy drinks in the morning.   They've spaced out their outdoor seating, offering a variety of picnic tables, chairs, and ready to-go fire pits for enjoying your beer or coffee.  We had the vegan frito pie, with a little spice, sliced avocado and queso, empanadas and a couple of local beers.  Come support this local business as capitalism allows the ingenuity of the independent business owner to give us all a unique experience."

Then played the giant beer pong game with my son which he had a blast. The outdoor lights the cool art themed interior makes you feel relaxed to slow life down just a bit to enjoy the the little things in life and watch your family smile! Especially at these not so pleasant times. Ask for Balde he is great brista/ bartender/ musician!"

Every hour the drinks increase by a dollar, so it pays to duck out of work before the 5pm whistle. The food is great too, if you're into that sorta thing."

We're usually the 4-5PM crowd, and it's just as good. The grilled cheese bites are the most bang for your buck, HUGE servings for the price and really gooey cheese. Loaded tots are my second go to, and easy to share with a friend. Ranch water a light, but the HH margs here are tall and strong. I have nothing but good words for this place!"

They have happy hour everyday of the week, from 3-6. We went yesterday, on. Saturday, and we were able to be seated on the patio right away. Our waiter yesterday, Tommy, was so nice, helpful, and genuine. The drinks and apps were on point, again, they have always been a favorite of mine for this reason. The sliders were delicious. Their patio heaters made it enjoyable to sit on the patio while it was chilly outside and we had a nice view of the sunset. Even the music was on point and the bathrooms were clean. I can't say that I've ever tried an entree but I'm sure they are up to par with everything else."

The hushpuppies and the grilled cheese bites. Happy hour is from 3-6 and is half priced drinks and apps and if you show up at 3 it's only $3 for each app. I recommend this spot for sure!   Overall: 4.7"

We did not have a good experience. The food was mediocre and the service was lacking. I think they were short staffed but it seemed that a worker or two were standing around not helping much. Our server was being used at the restaurant next door at least that is what we were told.  Anyway the shrimp and grits were a smaller than expected portion with some very skinny looking shrimp. The flavor was bland. The salads looked like a better option. Not sure I would give this place another try as I was less than impressed with the food."

I truly appreciate it when employees know their product and are confident when discussing it with their clients. She made drink and food recommendations based on what we like. The pretzel is so delicious and soft. Mmmmm with the cheese. The honey fried chicken wings are also outstanding. The bacon wrapped shrimp was good, but overpriced considering you are only getting 3 whole shrimp.all food arrived at our table promptly.   Truly great service and food."

Started our food tour with a mimo with pineapple juice and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was ehhhh but the champs saved the brunch!   The smoked salmon and sun-dried tomato relish was AMAZING! Noshed on the chicken and frites. The frites, the F R I T E S- wow! Great flavor and crispy the chicken was moist and delish.   When you are at GP, you have to get the birthday cake! A sweet concoction that leaves an instant smile on your face!    The service was attentive and energetic for a Sunday brunch. Social distancing was observed with table settings until the end of our meal when a party was sat right next to us. We decided to have our last sip and leave!   If you are looking for a fun brunch spot, definitely check this place out and have some cake!"

Lulu greeted us as soon as we sat the bar, told us where to find the menu, specials, and was very accommodating throughout the meal, even with a busy turnout.  We got the Shrimp and Avocado Salad, Avocado Toast, and Crab Hushpuppies. Crab Hushpuppies are killer - crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside! A fave dish.  Ally brought us the drinks - she was quick and was very welcoming! Everyone seemed to be busy but genuinely enjoyed tending to customers and let me be honest, I'm a sucker for good service.   Will be dining here again next time we come to San Antonio."

We came at 3 like if we were Steph Curry in an NBA game!! It was raining $3 on our check like the hurricane that hit NOLA in 2005.   P.S.   Food was amazing. $3 sliders tasted like $12."

We ordered mimosas and bloody mary.   Both were good, but again, it took forever for the server to come back after delivering our drinks to take a food order.  We also asked for waters with our drinks, which never came.   I finally had to walk over to the bar and ask the bartender for 2 glasses of water.  We ordered appetizers and a shrimp salad.  The salad was REALLY small for the price.  Appetizers (chicken balls and stuffed mushrooms) were lukewarm when served.    Not a fan of this place.   Will not recommend and will not go back........for food........maybe for drinks."

Decided to sit at the bar and that was the second best decision I made that day. Lulu was our bartender and honestly, one of the best I've had in San Antonio. She had great recommendations on drinks and food. Ended up getting the fish and chips and burrata on pistachio toast. Y'all, it was perfect. Don't sleep on that toast! Now for the drinks.... We had a tequila old fashion and it might be my new favorite tequila drink. So incredibly tasty! It was my birthday, so she spoiled us with some tequila shots with fresh cucumber and raspberry juice. Honestly, a solid experience and we will be back! Highly recommend!"

                "description": "The Pig Pen is my neighborhood joint. I have been here many times. I would make it my regular hangout but it doesn't carry any beer that my husband likes so we tend to go where he can get a good stout.   They usually have at least one or two IPA's on tap and that makes me happy.  As a hamburger lover, I have to give their hamburger just an average score. It's good but not amazing. Fries are good too.   My favorite menu item is the BBQ brisket nachos. They are OUTSTANDING and HUGE. You can share these for sure.  The BBQ Brisket grilled cheese is yummy too. The wings are pretty good. The tacos are okay. My son enjoys the hot wings and fried pickles.  We have only gone for brunch once before COVID and the brunch selection was pretty massive and everything was pretty tasty. I was pleased with the fried chicken and the brisket. I wasn't pleased with the price. It is expensive.   If you have little ones they have a great outdoor area for seating and a little playscape for the kiddos. And on Tuesday nights they have open mic nite. They have so much to offer.  Service has always been good and everyone is always friendly. I think you will be pleased if you visit The Pig-Pen. I think it is a perfect place during COVID b/c you can order everything outside and eat outside as well. Pay them a visit, please."

The tacos were large and filled with stuff so I left feeling full. I also got an IPA and that was solid too.  Experience: I went on a Friday around early evening and it wasn't too busy. They have an outdoor space that has a playground and the food truck (where the food comes from) and an inside space with lots of tables and benches. You can order everything at the bar and they'll give you a number so your food can be delivered to you. Service was fast and friendly.  Value: The tacos were $3 per, which is a bit pricey, but worth it given the size. The booze is cheap too! I highly recommend as a spot to get drinks and some good drunchies."

I want to chill at a bar and enjoy people watching and that doesn't include watching other people's children.   Food is available - brisket tends to be over smoked for my taste. The frozen margaritas are a bit too sweet. They do have a brunch buffet on sundays. Live music at times. Parking is a bit limited on site so you have to park across the streets or in the neighborhood.   Felt that the bar was a little understaffed - took a while to get our order even though we were sitting at the bar and even though it wasn't very busy.   But stop by and check it out to see what you think."

                "description": "Ok, first of all I would have never guessed this place would have turned into what it has. It is nestled back behind the smoke shack off broadway in the Alamo heights area. It's a little neighborhood bar that has a pretty interesting souther brunch on sundays. All of their food is catered by the smoke shake and it looks like that have some pretty awesome drinks to pair.   You walk in and buy your plate (buffet at $16 per person) and I'm sure you can take it from there. They have a very southern variety of foods such as collard creams, pinto beans, biscuits and gravy and grits. They also have pancakes, eggs, bacon, brisket Mac n cheese and sausage. But not just any sausage, they have a link STUFFED WITH BLUEBERRY PRESERVES. It was very good and I loved how unique it was. The service was really great and friendly and really just had a great small community vibe to it. Definitely a local hit spot.   I would probably return. The price is high but the food really was good. The only thing I'd change is since it's buffet style, it's hard to keep the food hot or even warm. Other than that though super solid southern take on brunch!"

Have never been to their brunch which i hear is amazing but the line to get in is usually wrapped around the building.  Whats good?  Brisket nachos - very good. Brisket cheese sandwich - awesome. Frozen moscow mule - fiance loves them. Lots of texas beer. There really isnt anything on their food menu that is not good. Would i say this place is better tham Alamo BBQ Co on grayson?  Unfortunately, yes. Even though both places are good. I think the organization of Pig Pen/Smoke Shack is much better. I also believe the quality of the food is WAY better. Price is much better too. If you have never been. Go check them out. Guaranteed a good time."

                "description": "What a gem! Came today for the Sunday brunch and what a treat!  Primarily a bar with indoor picnic seating inside. Outdoor sports another bar, with a large play scape for the kids. More picnic tables and some smaller tables around. Food truck sits in the back and opens after the brunch closes at 2. No kiddos after 9 at night.  So, the buffet....just about any southern classic breakfast item you can imagine. Biscuits, sausage, pancakes, blueberry sausage, eggs, bacon, black eye peas, collard greens, fried catfish, fried chicken, cheesy grits, brisket, blueberry cobbler, etc etc. Everything is outstanding. Delicious well priced mimosas and bloody Mary's.   Since there are instruction signs on what to do when you walk in, here's a hint. As you enter the doors, head to the left to the end of the bar to grab your disposable plate and your choice of beverage. Coffee and juices are included in your buffet price16 pp and 8 for kids.stake out a place to sit(make friends since you will sitting with others). Buffet is to the back wall. Make sure you get a new plate each time you go back for more.   Live blues music was also such a great surprise and really could have sat there mush longer listening to the acoustic music and song. Really will be back!"

                "description": "Had a friend visiting from out of town and all he'd eaten was Mexican or Tex-Mex since he got here on Friday. We definitely had to switch it up today. So we decided to try out Pigpen and omg we were not disappointed. The food was freaking awesome.  When we walked in they were absolutely packed, it was a little chaotic and for being my first time it was slightly overwhelming for a bit since we didn't know where to go or what to do. We stood in a line that was apparently for the food, but we needed to be in the line to pay first, so I slipped out from one line and into the other leaving my dude in the food line so we wouldn't lose our spot.  I paid the bartender, then slipped back in line for the food. It is set up buffet style on Sunday's, hence the line to get food. When we finally got to the food, it looked so good! Eggs, hash brown, silver dollar pancakes, biscuits, tortillas, breakfast sausage links, breakfast sausage patties, grits, Mac and cheese, collard greens, black eyed peas, pulled pork, bacon, brisket, blueberry cobbler, peach cobbler and then all the fixings, coffee, juice, fresh fruit... and everything was freaking amazing! Literally amazing!  The brisket was tender, and had a great flavor. It wasn't the best brisket I've ever had but it was super super good. For a quick comparison, Augie's down the street has better brisket overall. But, this being what it was, a buffet, the brisket was better than expected, so hats off to the cook on that.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because there is no direction as far as when you arrive. For someone who had never been, It was super Overwhelming and my anxiety level was through the roof. I literally started sweating. I know it sounds crazy but for someone who deals with social anxiety it was almost enough to make me walk out the door. To be fair, there was a sign, telling you \"seat yourself, pay for food and order drinks at the bar\" but the long lines that were literally to the door were a bit perplexing until I was able to figure out what was going on. A host or a quick explanation of the process by an employee would have been welcome. Overall this place was super good but the inside seating can be a bit snug and be prepared to be friendly because it is set up kind of picnic style. Oh and they had live music! You can't beat that.

The quantity is a bit overwhelming, but I suppose it matches the price. The brisket grilled cheese was okay, a little over salted. The fries were like grease sponges that seemed like they had been sitting out for awhile and then flash fried them again. There was very little potato and a whole lot of grease. This used to be a good spot. Will not be rushing  back anytime soon."

The brunch is about $16 and has a nice assortment of breakfast foods and barbecue. I tried a bit of everything and I have to say the mac n cheese and collard greens really stood out! The brisket and pulled pork were pretty good for a buffet. There was live music inside and the bar was open to order drinks/buckets. Overall, solid food and a great atmosphere. Looking forward to coming back for another Sunday brunch!"

                "description": "Solid food, but foodtruck-slow service.  Dropped into The Pigpen at a Monday noon start due to the Smoke Shack's being closed for a Food Network shoot.  No worries, as The Pigpen still offered the transcendental brisket grilled cheese.  Unfortunately, it's only life-changing if you can get the sandwich before your lunch hour is up.  Brisket grilled cheese was surprisingly light for a sandwich made of meat, cheese, and an unhealthy helping of fried butter.  The bread gave way with a light crunch, and the cheese must have been detuned/desalted as to not overpower the soft, juicy brisket that retained a subtle smoky punch - though not as smoke rich as the burnt ends of the artist formerly known as Oklahoma Joe's in KCMO.  Fried onion rings similarly featured a light batter, not the breaded mummification found at lesser joints.  Unfortunately, the grilled cheese took a half hour to reach the table despite my being the second table to order for lunch service.  By 12:30, quoted food times stretched to an hour, and out-of-town guests looking for Smoke Shack offerings began to trickle out the door, unsatisfied.  Next time, will visit the Smoke Shack for Smoke Shack meats."

Before the food was so good it was worth the bad setup they have for their Sunday brunch. This place can get so packed, and the way the seating and buffet is setup there's no room to enjoy the food. Today wasn't bad probably b/c we arrived early. For the $16 price I expect a better setup, seating, and the food to stay warm. The food is still good but seems to have fallen a little since the last time I was here. I have always loved these owners food since they were a food truck. I will definitely come back another time to see how things are!"

                "description": "This is an amazing brunch!   After seeing so many good reviews about this place for brunch I was finally able to come here with some out of town friends and my husband. Everyone loved it! (That includes my husband who doesn't love brunch the way that I do.) The bbq (brisket and pulled pork) was definitely the unanimous favorites by everyone.   My first round, I took a little of everything that looked good to me to try a bite of each. My favorites that I got a bigger portion of on round 2 was the pulled pork, brisket, bacon, mac and cheese and biscuit/gravy (the fresh biscuits had just come out). Even saying that, everything else I had round 1 was good (sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, fried catfish).  I'd say for first timers, if you want to try something and it's low, just wait for your 2nd time through the line. They are constantly replenishing the food.  Great food and a relaxing way to do brunch with some friends. Our friends stayed for 2+ hours, we were there for just over an hour."

I tried both of their sours and they were some of the better sours I've had in Texas so far. Unfortunately, when I asked for a taster it was brought out to me in those little paper cups that you put ketchups in at McDonald's.   What kind of brewery gives out tasters like that? I would hope that there would be a little more pride in their product than to present it like pills at a nursing home.   Similarly, service was...questionable. Our server didn't just seem new but discombobulated. He couldn't answer questions about their beers but I had to point out what I was talking about on the menu.   Their beers are good, they are but it doesn't reflect it in so many ways."

Congealed cheese spread. Brisket is dry but tasted. Nope. Not worth it.   On a brighter note the IPA and sour were very good.   Come for the beers but seriously skip the food. Nope.  Not worth it!   We have had such better food at other breweries. I'm so disappointed.  If I were giving stars foe the food they would barely get a 1. The beer would get a 4. I'm being generous with a 3 for both the stuff they call food and the beer together."

We walked in, received a hello and water immediately! Great start! We then sat for OVER a half an hour before ANYONE acknowledged us again and that was after we went to the bar and inquired if we could order any time soon. So... 45 minutes in we were asked what we would like to order... two burgers, fries, one with garlic fries, prickly pear margarita and ice for our water.   15 minutes later we got the margarita and we again asked for ice.   15 minutes later we got our burgers.   His burger was great! The bacon was crispy and thick and the burger was tasty. I know because I took a bite (or 2!!) My burger not only had a rancid smell it tasted bad. I could not eat it. They took off the price of the burger, however, said it was fresh today. I was trained in quality control for the HEB meat plant years ago. I know this meat was not good. I don't know why- it just wasn't.   Garlic fries meant two tablespoons of minced garlic dumped on top of fries. I think my breath still stinks a day later even though I tried to scrape it off.  The margaritas were okay. No alcohol because nothing registered!!   Food was served by the same people who cleared the tables. It was just all around a crummy experience. What I do know is restaurants are now all under staffed and going out to eat is a gamble at best. I would not say not to go to Blue Star, maybe we were there on a super bad day, bad moment in time for them.   We won't go back, but if you're into beer and enjoy their atmosphere... enjoy!"

There was nothing too exciting about it: tomato, lettuce, and some sort of falafel like thing. No sauce, seasoning, pickles or anything. I had to ask for ranch.   The french fries were good though! They are 4 star fries.   Service was good.   Outdoor spacing for Covid was okay... not great, but not terrible. Some tables were definitely not 6 feet apart, the guy sitting behind me was probably only about 3.5 feet away. Some tables were 6 feet though.  Take out box is styrofoam, which is really unfortunate since they never decompose and can't be recycled."

What used to be a source of great food and decent craft beer is sadly only a ghost of its former self. Tasted beers thst are from their standard line up thst across the board were mere suggestions of the quality ales they used to produce. The food also was really sad, US Foods Frozen Products reheated... should have noted the poor state of affairs in the kitchen on our way in... pretty shabby and disorganized - I ha e t seen a kitchen in this much disarray since the last time I watched Jon Tapper on TV. Having been a Craft Beer Connisseur for over 30 years now. This place has all the signs of a dying brewery struggling to gasp its last breath. Good Brewhouse and some great fixtures soon to be bought cheap at auction unless a miracle in the form of an investor with a great chef and a great brewer shows up soon. Save your money - San Antonio has a lot of WONDERFUL Independent Craft Beer and exceptional food out there, why waste it here. Very Sad."

The bacon cheddar burger I ordered was cold and raw in the middle, my wife's turkey BLT was bland and literally just two slices of toast with freezer cold turkey, avocado and bacon in the middle. The cup of chili soup we ordered had the look and texture of dog food.  The only good part about our food were the fries.   I went to the bathroom at one point and the floor was sticky, urinals were filthy, there was no toilet paper, and no soap to wash your hands. And this was on at Monday at about noon.. how do y'all not even have the proper standards to even clean the bathrooms?

Blue star brewing has a lot or space and is in a great location in Southtown, so we decided to try them out.   I got the Turkey BLT and Southtown Mule. I specifically asked for no bacon and asked if I could have extra avacado, but the server forgot and he never came back after we ordered our food. Also the sandwich itself was two buttered pieces of bread with deli chicken, lettuce, avacado, and tomatoes and lacked a lot of flavor. The Southtown mule was okay, but I could mostly taste the ice and ginger beer.   Positives: great location, indoor and outdoor seating  Negatives: food lacking flavor, okay service, watered down drinks"

If you'd like to take some of their beer home, you can do so by purchasing one of their growlers. Their growlers are pretty affordable and definitely worth it.   Food: This is where things get a little 3-star ish for me. I've been coming here multiple times, and their food is never consistent. Sometimes it can be excellent and other times way below average. I also think their food prices can be a bit overpriced to what they are actually serving.  Service: If you sit in the bar, you'll definitely get a 5-star service, but outside of the bar gets a little flaky. I've had some pretty horrible service at Blue Star, but it seems that they staff is always changing and every time I come back I see someone new."

Finally, I saw a server and asked. It's self seating. She said take a picture of the bar menu then sit wherever . I asked for a sample of beer but it was warm so that didn't work. I thought for sure I'd be offered some suggestions for beer/drinks since this is a \"brewery\" but nope. I randomly guessed (server wasn't helpful). to snack on, I ordered the garlic and parsley fries. Absolutely the worst. No flavor what so ever. I had to ask for salt. Soggy too.   The atmosphere is nice. I sat outside. If I do come back, I'll just keep my expectations low so I won't be disappointed again. The food isn't pricey at all but I guess it really shouldn't be based on my dry experience â€"

Good food from a varied menu that has generous portions--and the taste that will knock your socks off (even if you wear sandals).

You have refreshing and traditional, the raspberry geyser and the King William Ale that are San Antonio's best.   Go now!"

They only have the outside seating area available for customers. I think that that is a big mistake. The chips and salsa was okay. The drinks never have disappointed me. The raspberry margarita was delicious. I highly recommend it. The service is slow and I hope that things improve soon because people will become less patient as things open up more. Some people left the line because it was taking so long. I enjoy the place when I'm walking downtown on the weekends. If you are in the Blue Star area you should grab a drink and/or food if you are so inclined."

                "description": "We stop in whenever we visit the area, which is every couple of years.  I originally loved them because they had some amazing sour beers.  The sours have disappeared over the years and have gotten less sour.  I still go back because I have good memories, but I'm not as impressed as I once was.  The food is a little on the expensive side, and they don't have great vegetarian offerings.  We skipped eating there on this trip because of that. This time they only had two sours on the menu.  One was a raspberry, which I didn't even try.  I'm not a fan of sweet and fruity beer, I want a strong sour.  I got the Southtown sour.  It was OK. It was a little weak on the sour.  My kids were with me and they got sodas.  One of them had the root beer and he loved it.  The other one got the ginger ale.  It was so strong on the ginger that it was undrinkable.  I tried it, it was awful.    This was my fourth or fifth visit to Blue Star over the past five years.  After this experience, I think I'll probably skip going there on my next trip."

                "description": "The Texas Rangers: Facts you may not know     It's the oldest law enforcement agency in North America. Stephen F. Austin organized the 1st group of 10 Texas Rangers in 1823. They were farmers and ranchers.   They became known as \"Los Diablos Tejanos,\" meaning Texas Devils.  In the early days, Rangers would have to dismount their horses to reload their muzzleloaders. In an effort to be more efficient, they began using the 5-shot revolver (invented by Samuel Colt).  There are honorary Texas Rangers: John Wayne, Will Rogers, President George H.W. Bush and Chuck Norris.   In honor of the department's 180th anniversary in 2004, a Texas Ranger badge was carried into space on the Endeavor Space Shuttle Mission by Col. Paul Lockhart.  The first badges came from cutting a star into a Mexican silver coin. This was a way of showing dominance over Mexico. The nickname for the Texas Ranger badge is Cinco Peso.  Ranger Frank Hamer teamed up with local law enforcement from Texas and Louisiana and is responsible for ambushing and killing Bonnie and Clyde.   Texas Rangers Have Prevented at Least One Presidential Assassination, in 1909, when US President William Howard Taft met with Mexican President Porfirio Diaz in El Paso, Texas.   In World War II, the German press mistakenly reported that the Army Rangers were Texas Rangers. This caused some panic among German civilians, due to the fearsome reputation of the Texas Rangers. Finally, the public was told the invaders were \"only\" Army Rangers. The average age of a Texas Ranger is 44."

There is a big bar here, but it was pretty early and we headed to the museum  right of the bat.  There are like 1,000 stuffed taxidermy animals here. It was crazy, but pretty cool I don't know if I would be happy if I paid more than $10 here, but they also have a place of circus freaks and some fun circus oddities, like ledges you can stand on, while they look like they are on diagonal planes, you can still stand straight on them.  Fun little place to spend a half hour walking through and pretty close to the Alamo."

I repeat, I can say NOTHING about the saloon.   I received a free admission to the museum with my 3 day hop on hop off bus tour... that's a whole other review.....  Ok... here goes.... My two cents on the museum.....  I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it.....  While there is an amazing amount taxidermy displays... that's all it is... and while they are impressive. That's all it is. Maybe it's just me but.... Umm no thank you. It's just not what I want to see room after room of stuffed bears and lions and snakes.   As I said just my opinion, not my thing, but the taxidermy was impressive."

                "description": "I visited April 2 with a 6 year old. We initially came and ate lunch after getting off the Hop off Hop on bus tour. You have to order food at the counter and then find a spot. The food was descent. I had BBQ Brisket which I really enjoyed and my son had a burger which he did not eat. But, it didn't look bad. The restaurant area has a ton of charm, a lot of history and a cool long bar. Bathrooms in the back with some arcade games and good old fashion shooting game.  We were not certain about doing the museum as I did not think my son would like it if it was a bunch of stuffed dead animals. I asked the guy the guy that worked at the restaurant and he said a lot of kids liked it, so why not? We were there. It was a bit pricey, but ended up being worth the cost. It was a pretty large place and doesn't even appear to be that big from the outside. We spent a ton of time inside and didn't even really see anyone else.  They do have a LOT of dead stuffed animals lol. But they also have a lot of interesting historical items such as furniture, guns, etc. It is actually two levels too. Our favorite area was this area of \"show freaks\" as they had shrunken heads, mermaid fish, two headed animals, fleas with clothes, etc. I'm pretty sure one of those shrunken heads looked like my ex-husband, or at least in my dreams it did.  It was really fun. They also have some interactive type exhibits that you can walk in, like tilted rooms. Interesting stuff."

Stepping inside, you're immediately welcomed by a huge high-ceiling room with walls covered in taxidermy. As a hunter myself, I thought it was very awesome to see that collection. I couldn't not sit at the bar and grab a delicious local brew (lots of options) while I admired the art. I didn't go into the actually museum but it looked worthwhile.  Yes, the big elephant (which seems to be the centerpiece) is real and is from the 1960's."

                "description": "2019 Yelp 120 Challenge - #100  On our Hop on Hop off tour the Buckhorn Saloon was one of the stops. It said that shortly after opening The Buckhorn Saloon, Albert learned that many folks traveling off the dusty trail didn't have much money. The owner Albert had the great idea to accept horns and antlers in exchange for a free beer or a shot of whiskey from his saloon.   Now the Buckhorn collection has grew to become one of the world's most unique and largest collections of horns and antlers. The impressive horn and antler collection lined every wall and ceiling, which is why it is known as the Buckhorn Hall of Horns. Now different antlers are hung above the entry way to different exhibits.   Cost: You will receive $3 off with a Yelp check-in.  Each ticket is roughly $20 each and you get two exhibits for the price of one.   My husband and I opted out of going into the exhibits and grabbed to cold beers from the bar. It would have been cool if they still accepted antlers or horns in exchange for a local drink from the bar."

Everything was kid friendly, and it was nice to bring out-of-town guests to learn a bit about Texas history and wildlife.  Lunch in the saloon was a great idea in between museums, and that ran ~$10/person for simple bar type burgers and fare. FYI- You get a discount on lunch if you've paid for tickets!"

They don't take care of the lanes like a real bowling ally so the ball catches grip which is not helpful if you bowl spin. Otherwise great environment to come and chill at an excellent location with all the surrounding restaurants and shops."

You're paying for the atmosphere and the \"experience.\" The problem is the experience, while good, does not live up to the hefty prices. Overall fun spot, but you'll definitely pay."

Honestly I think I would just prefer to go to a regular bowling alley...I feel like this is upscale bowling (and I just noticed in other reviews it actually is upscale bowling-nahhhh, yall can have that). Service was slow and the food wasn't that tasty either. Just meh for me *shoulder shrug*"

This is supposed to be upscale bowling, cocktails and dinning. I'm happy that they brought bowling/an activity to The RIM. My main complaint would be it is not as upscale as other locations, and that it is not true bowling due to the strings attached to the pins."

We were greeted at the front promptly and escorted to our lane by Sal who introduced us to our server Anthony. Anthony was very attentive and had great suggestions for food and drinks. We enjoyed the pizza I highly recommend it if you like Grimaldis this pizza is way better ! We started with spinach dip and fries that were tasty ! Burgers in a bag were a hit with the kids bacon Mayo is delish. Anthony suggested ranch water for a refreshing drink and it did not disappoint. I highly recommend Bowl And Barrel for the food and service !  Not to mention we had the managers come by twice to check on us we were very pleased. We can't wait to go back !"

I placed a food order at the beginning of my 1.5h reservation with my waitress who failed to write my order down after attempting to write my order on her hand but her pen didn't work, she had a pocket full of other pens, mind you. I never received my food. I was with a group of people and instead of splitting our bill as requested, the waitress decided to split the tab however the computer did it, not giving anyone an itemized receipt after charging our cards. I had one drink at the bar prior to starting to bowl and was charged $7. I ordered 2 of the same drink while bowling and some how my bill was $27. I'm no math genius but that clearly just doesn't add up. If you want to be charged correctly and to receive good service, this isn't the place for you."

Pizza took 2 hours before it was serviced, missing foods from our order.  The worst part is that they bowl by the hours and does not tell you.  They lied and told me I had to pay for an addition hour with the kids bowl promo but then also told us we timed up.  At the end we didn't get to bowl our 2nd game.  What a gimmick! If you want to run a business based one lies, then so be it.  Every dog has its days."

                "description": "We've been here several times both before and during COVID and every time the service is terrible - it's unfortunate because there aren't very many decent places to bowl in San Antonio.   This whole place is run by high school and college kids, always running around frantically, not a single competent adult to speak to about your food/drink order which is ALWAYS incorrect. Twice they've \"run out of wine\" and can't tell the difference between wine and champagne/Prosecco yet they serve mimosas. Also, doesn't matter what pizza you order, you'll most definitely end up with a Margherita pizza EVERY time but you'll be too hungry and pissed to send it back because then you'll wait an additional 30 minutes for another incorrect order. It's also likely you'll wait a good 10 minutes after your food arrives  for plates and utensils.  This is not a once or twice occurrence, we have issues every time we've been to this establishment and we will not be coming back again."

Yesterday when I went the only thing I can say is the drinks were good and that's it. The music was lame. I tried to order food but the server said the kitchen was closed. Why would you close the kitchen when your open for another 2 1/2 hours? It doesn't make sense. Very disappointed!!! I don't know if I'd go back."

Honestly, my favorite time to come is for brunch, especially when it's nice enough to sit outside. The ambiance is amazing: brews, live music, and great brunch! Our first time here was for a Mother's Day brunch, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy wonderful weather and got to sit outside and hear some live music! Their avocado toast is delicious: kale, sprouts, and eggs however you like them. It's perfect if you like healthier fare. Some of the skillets and schnitzels are more popular, but I'd honestly get the avocado toast again as it was THAT good.   We most recently came here for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner and really enjoyed it! For starters, the service is amazing. We showed up with cakes, cupcakes, and an ice chest full of ice cream. The wait was an hour long, but they sat us quickly when they realized how much stuff we had brought. They kept the cake in the fridge for us and provided candles and a lighter, which was super nice and helpful! The service alone is reason enough to come back: they truly go above and beyond. For dinner, I ordered the grilled salmon and my husband had the TX BBQ shrimp. My salmon was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the potatoes! The shrimp was amazing - I wish I'd ordered it! It had a good amount of heat to it as it also has andouille sausage. It's definitely worth ordering!  As a side note, this place can get PACKED on any given weekend and doesn't take reservations. Something to keep in mind during peak hours if you're coming starving. Overall, can't recommend this place enough if you're stopping in New Braunfels. It's truly a must-do!"

Definitely very popular. The outdoor seating is ginormous! You could tell they were busy but still Emilia, the manager , who was acting as hostess and all around hands on, was very sweet accommodating all who came to her. She was very quick to meet everyone's needs.   I sat at the bar, thanks to Emilia (the first waitress I encountered at the bar was very rude and actually told me there was a wait for the bar and I needed to se Emilia... she was wrong, bar's open seating as in all places). Cynthia ended up being my server. She was wonderful and quick to take my order and check on me for drinks, etc.   They were out of the Wiener schnitzel, which was the reason I originally went, so it was very disappointing. While the ambiance and space and food were great, I was a bit disappointed at the fact that they didn't have such a signature dish so early in the day (noon). I ended up getting a jager schnitzel which felt a bit dry / over fried, but the mushroom sauce was delicious! It was tasty but I'll have to go back and see if it was just bad luck. The fingerling potatoes were well seasoned and delicious. I don't eat boiled cabbage or sauerkraut, but I tasted it and seemed pretty authentic.   They did have quite a varied menu of both food and drinks and most of the waiters and waitresses seemed to be very on top of service. I'll definitely be back in hopes of getting a Wiener schnitzel and maybe try a few other items."

They brought out a cast iron pan with cubed raisin bread swimming in a puddle of butter and sugar. I'm sorry, but in my opinion bread pudding should hold together when removed from the baking pan.  This rendition seemed like cubed bread slathered in sauce.  Where is the cream or milk?  Where were the eggs?  I don't know what it was, but I can't call it bread pudding.  The hot cocoa was hot but not much else."

They have a huge outdoor Biergarten and even the \"indoor\" Bierhalle is essentially outdoor, with mesh walls and sky high ceilings. Dogs are not only allowed, but encouraged, both in the Biergarten and the Bierhalle. There were several there when we visited and they were all very well behaved.   We ordered a ton of food here, and liked all of it. I'm not usually a fan of shoestring fries, but the ones here were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The broccoli was also prepared perfectly, not over or under cooked. The red cabbage was pickled, making for a unique but very good dish. The Apple fritters were the highlight of the evening. More closely resembling a corn fritter than the Apple fritters you would get at a donut shop, they were crispy on the outside, soft inside and came with a delectable dipping sauce.   A couple of complaints. The live music (a Biergarten staple) was WAY too loud. We had to lean right up to each other's ears to talk to one another. Also, although our main course came surprisingly fast, we had to wait forever for the dessert."

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this restaurant and the rating it has on here fits it well. It is not horrible but not overly fantastic. I can see this as a place to hang out with friends for a beer and finger foods.   The day we went there was a farmer's market so we were occupied while we waited the 45 minutes it took to get a table. I am guessing COVID restrictions play part in this, which is fine. The beers are good! I lived in Germany (Heidelberg, Ketch, and Kaiserslautern) for over 12 years and my husband is French and German, born and raised in Schweinfurt, Germany. Going to German restaurants are a treat for us because we like to compare American German restuarnt to the originals. All American German restuarnat cater to the Bavaria region of Germany and this one does a great job mixing both American and German style foods.   I had the Texas schnitel, which I did not care that much for. My husband had the German meatball which was amazing. The brussel sprouts are some of the best I've tasted since moving here.   In all, this is a fun place to hang out with friends and family. They have live music, which I would have hoped was traditional German, but hey! I do see myself visiting a third time."

The schnitzel was fantastic and the beer cheese sauce was delicious as an appetizer! They have plenty of great German beer options and I would love to come back here again! The brown mushroom gravy was delicious and they have a cool outdoor seating area and bar as well."

Unfortunate for a $30 entry."

Menu is not updated at all. All the beers I tried to order were not available. We ordered the large pretzel with the mustard sauces and cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was fantastic and I enjoyed the honey mustard as well. My son and I split the German meatball with spatzle. The meatball wasn't very hot but it was good. Nothing spectacular but it was good. Good size portions. My boyfriend ordered the Texas schnitzel and it was ok, a bit dry and over cooked. The green beans were ok and the mashed potatoes were way too salty. They would've been great with less salt. The beers we had were the liters abd they were served in a huge mug. Those were perfect."

Still hit or miss on the table service, but overall they have it down. Being very cautious about distancing and masks.  New and updated menu which has some great items on it.

My favorite things to eat here: rueben with chips (so so good), soft pretzel with beer cheese, and the kartoffel poppers!  They have a ton of beers on tap, you're likely going to find something that you enjoy. They even had an Apple Pie Mimosa today and it was delicious. There is tons of space outside, and the beer garden area. (Only downside is that when they have music it is LOUD) I've never eaten on the real inside before, it's never been an option so I'm not sure how to get a seat in there?  The only reason for 4 stars is because service is consistently poor. I also tried 2 desserts today and was disappointed in both. (Bread pudding and chocolate cake, no ice cream because the machine was down)"

Just a great place to come and hang out and have fun.  It can be busy on the weekends so be prepared to get on the list and wait for 30 minutes or so. They will text you when they have a table. There are tables to use while waiting so you can get some pre-meal drinks if you like.  The food is just good here. My wife had the carrot cake and she absolutely loved it. I had a pretzel and we both had some drinks. This was just a fun Saturday afternoon!"

We waited for 15 minutes later and had to flag down a server. For the third time in a row we were told that there's a limited menu for no good reason other than the \"kitchen is slow.\" So no kartoffel poppers.....the best item on the menu. After bringing appetizers we waited 40 minutes and were told by server that she forgot to put in our order.  The manager (Sabrina) was unapologetic and asked if everything else was timely. What else?? No entrees came out and nobody asked if we wanted more drinks.  Don't waste your time here...and it is a waste.   Last few visits have been bad. Its a shame. This place used to be good. Lots of room to make something better in New Braunfels. Owner needs to wake up. Great spot but going down hill."

However, I have been to a few fairly respected German Restaurants here in Central TX and this was the best meal of that particular faire I have had.  We drove 1-1/2 hrs down to New Braunfels from Williamson County and it was worth it. I had the Sausage Plate, Weisswurst (veal) and Bratwurst (pork).  It comes with sauerkraut and the German Potato Salad.  The Potato Salad was awesome.  This potato salad is room temp and vinegary (you know if you have had German Potato Salad before).  It's not the creamy cold type you might get at a BBQ Joint.  Before the entree was served we had a cup of Cream of Mushroom Soup, very delicious. The menu is not huge but it seems to cover the range of faire you expect at a German Restaurant.  There is no children's menu or any Non-German dishes i.e. hamburgers, chicken tenders, etc. So everybody in your group needs to like German Food or be open to trying it.  We'll be back for sure."

Restaurant is adorable - love the location right by everything - super easy to walk to a bakery or around downtown   3. The food is DELICIOUS. From the rye bread, the schnitzels and sausages, and ESPECIALLY the black forest cake. Seriously, the best I've ever had.    Cons:   1. They run out of the Black Forest cake. Seriously. I went here on my birthday, and they run out of it at the beginning of the week usually. And it's REALLY the best. I hope they start making MOOOOREEE!   2. It's a little pricey, but the portions are huge and sharing is definitely easy."

Picked this place and really enjoyed the service and selection of items!  The rye bread was really great! Then I had garlic soup that was good. The Wife wanted to try the sausage sampler. They had the spicy mustard I like. The only problem I had is, I've never had jalapeÃ±o sausage in Germany!! Not my thing.  Then I had the Rinder Goulash that was really great, the Wife had Huhnerbrust Geschnetzeltes. Chicken breast with sautÃ©ed spinach with mushrooms that was good as well!  I really like the place. I wish Yelp allowed 3 1/2 stars. Would I go back, you bet!"

Firstly the series's great. The waitress was friendly and the place very clean. Beautiful ambiance perfect for a date or a couples dinner night. The food was good both my girls and husband agree it was yummy. All of our food came correct and hot. The beer was cold and the bread was fresh. Something to note while this is not a dress up place it's easy to feel under dressed. Also, this is a great place to try new things but the price is high and the options limited. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet dinner with good food. As far as the food it was a little salty but flavorful. The sausage mustard was to die for and the red cabbage was absolutely delicious. We left full and satisfied."

The decor in the restaurant was nice and reminded me of my grandparents house when I was a young man. The service here was exceptional. Very friendly, very professional and well mannered wait staff. If you want a kind of modern take on this cultural fare then maybe it's good, but old school authentic German food it is not. First of all the Kartoffel Knoedel were more of a grainy mashed potato that was scooped into a ball form. If you've had legit potato dumplings you'd know that these are not them.  Spatzel was meh. Beef goulash with Hungarian spicy paprika. Kudos for using the Hungarian spicy paprika. But why the hell is the sauce tomato based with bell peppers? If that's what you're looking for then maybe not too bad, but again, not traditional.   Jagerschnitzel was okay. Sauce wasn't the greatest.  I didn't hate the place, it's just it didn't excite the palate."

The restaurant was full throughout the evening, patrons being entertained by an accordion player that serenaded guests table side. A limited menu showing focus pays off, everything we have tried is delicious. Overall, a great neighborhood spot that we frequently visit!"

I have to get to go because my wife is paralyzed from waist down, I went one time to dine in at 7:30 and was told they were not taking customers on a Friday, call and was told they are not taking phone orders. For a industry that was in dire straits last year I find this a poor decision. I've eaten there a few time and it was fair, I miss friesen haus it was at least flavored unlike this place mushrooms gravy that elder eats raved about its bland and lack luster and small portions."

                "description": "This little cottage restaurant has the potential to be a absolutely great German restaurant. However, it has a little house work to do to get there. No doubt it has the charming ambience and Great German food of the best restaurants in the country.   Here is a list of minor items that needs to take care of first.  1. A vase of plastic flowers on the tables needs to have real flowers. 2. The bread needs to be changed to a better hearty German bread instead of the white bread with brown swirls. 3. Do not simply dump a small pile of foil-wrap butter pads, but have a real butter server with the bread. 4. The service on a Sunday afternoon was deplorable. The young man probably was a student from TSU in nearby San Marcos, working on weekends to make a little money for college. He did not repeat the orders from the four of us and therefore our food came all mixed up. He never thought to refill any of our drinks until we finally ask him to. He was a nice of guy  but just not trained to be a true sophisticated food server like this little restaurant deserves.  By the way, having a young singer with real lederhosen amble through the dining rooms singing German songs with his accordion was brilliant. This restaurant is truly a little gem that simply needs to be polished."

Atmosphere is really charming and we love the musician playing the accordion.  Some of my favorites here are the jager schnitzel with spaetzle. At lunch the schnitzel sandwich, which I add a side of jager gravy to pour over the schnitzel and then put the bread back on top. So yummy!"

I cannot pronounce or spell it but it had a spicy paprika sauce and it was spicy and delicious. My husband had Jaeger schnitzel  with dumplings that were out of this world. They had a young man playing accordion and it was great music to hear. We chatted with him a bit. The house is cozy and beautiful."

                "description": "I've been here a few times and every time has been delightful.  Unfortunately, I have only one picture of a Bloody Mary to memorialize or summarize all the great food I've had here.  more pictures needed  The chips and queso are always a winner in my book. The queso pairs well with chips, pizza, tots, and wedges.   The queso isn't super spicy so we like to add more jalapenos to the mix. The wedges were super addictive. Nicely fried and seasoned. I'm sure the tots would have been the same, but I couldn't eat any more potatoes.   The habanero ranch lime wings. Those are amazing. So yummy, I'm practically drooling as I think about them. Again, not too spicy, so if you want the heat you might need to ask them to increase it for you. I also really like the garlic parmesan wings, this is actually my favorite flavor, but I'm fairly certain that the HRL has taken the top spot.   Last night we tried a roast beef sandwich. It was ok. The bread was super salty, almost to the point that I couldn't eat it. However, I noticed it was primarily on top of the bread so I just took it off the bread. I probably wouldn't order that again. I'll stick to the queso, wings, and pizza.   I had the pizza back in January. It was fabulous, especially the next day. I loved the crust and I'm not usually a fan of bready crusts.   For dessert, we took caramel churros back home for later. I can only imagine the bliss of eating them warm on site. Those were some damn good churros. Overflowing with caramel and served with vanilla ice cream and an additional drizzle of caramel. It was dreamy!  Oh yeah and so the Bloody Mary. I never knew I liked pickled green beans until last weekend. Maybe I can get a bowl of them as an appetizer next time I'm there.  Omg I'm a jerk for not mentioning the amazing service. Table service and bar service has always been on point. Everyone there is attentive and honestly they have always gotten our order right. This is important because I've been there with a picky....*ahem* specific orderer. Thank you for being patient and pleasant!"

                "description": "Thought we would check out local food.  Actual date was Saturday was a very place.  College football was on almost every tv. You could feel the energy in the establishment. All good, very jovial vibe.    If you find yourself in the area, decide to drop in! You must try the Anchor Bar Dip! Like a mix of queso with blue cheese. Don't try to understand just eat and enjoy.    Drinks were cold and blended with the right amount of alcohol.  So good we had 2 each.     I had the lemon pepper wings. Wow! Loved the crispy lemon pepper wings. Hot and spiced perfectly.  The fries were hot right out of the fryer! I feet compelled to eat all the fries.   Spouse had the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich. Fresh baked bread, and tasty meat with fresh bell peppers.    The only issue we had was the lack of service. May have been due to the busy night.   Waited awhile for water refills, drinks  and bill.    Overall great place. May return during a slow night."

                "description": "Considering I've eaten at the original location in Buffalo (#1), it admittedly feels strange (yet exciting) to have the option to do so in San Antonio. It is a very different feel but is still a very solid choice for some serious comfort food.  First off, this place is massive. It really doesn't look that big from the outside but there is ample seating and different party rooms. The parking is also abundant and they have a playground right out front for the youngins. This is a place where I would definitely consider hosting a large gathering (#2).  I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Everything I ate was a gut bomb, but in the best way. Everything from the burgers, mac and cheese, tater tots, loaded appetizers, and the wings were quite tasty. The portions are excellent and this would be an ideal spot for a very big eater.  The real unfortunate thing is there is a wing shortage, and as a result the prices were a bit on the high side. Nothing's cheap during the pandemic but the quality of the food doesn't necessarily always coincide with the price.  Service is ok but not phenomenal. In dining service seems to be the way to go, even if I'm not entirely sure if the staff is fully masked up. Phone manners were a little suspect in the wait for my take out was a lot longer than I anticipated. In the end, I'm still happy I found this place and look forward to trying it again.  __________ (#1) Where I learned the origin of a \"buffalo wing.\"  (#2) Once the pandemic is over, naturally."

The flavor choices are plentiful and I no longer have to wait forever at Pluckers for a table and the wings here are not dry!  The pizza is huge and feeds my teens and 2 adults easily!  Wings are really good especially the Ranch rub and garlic parm with blue cheese which isn't the best but the wings make up for that. If you request celery and carrots, just know you only get 2 small carrot pieces and 2 teeny celery pieces The waitress on our last visit was not real good at keeping our drinks filled, we had to ask for refills, boxes but she was very quick to bring the check and cone back to cash it out.  Also, we were asked to sit at the end of the long bar table top instead of an actual table and there were 5 of us. We enjoyed the NBA final game 4 though with 360Â° views all around! It was awesome My patty melt was perfect too."

It looked like they have added a ton of outdoor seating, but it was a bit cold tonight. I don't know how authentic this location is to the original, but we went their a few years ago and have an affinity to the brand. Get the blue cheese!  I got a single order(10) hot and my wife got a snack size(5) medium. Both had a good mix of drumettes and flats. I added wedges, she got tots. The wings and potatoes were all nice and crispy and came with carrots and celery with no up charge.   They have a full bar and the beer is either big brand or local craft, with a good selection of draft and bottles/cans. They also had a lot of specialty mixed drinks, but we like beer with wings. The beers were all around $5 or less from what I looked at.   The booths all had extra plexiglass dividers between them, the tables had plastic sheets on plastic stands, and there was a self service temperature scanner by the door, but we didn't see that until on the way out. Each table had a placard with QR codes for the drink and food menus."

No less than 8 employees walking in and out of the office, door kept opening and closing, staff knocking on the door asking if they could come in too, as we sat there with no service...finally a young man asked if we wanted a drink..ordered 2 beers..never got them...a few minutes later a different young man came up and apologized for out wait, gave us menus explained a few things and left. We watched 6 employees gather behind a counter in a high energy conversation..including the two who came to our table...they all talked for a while!! No beers were ever delivered, no order was ever taken..we watched others come in, given water and napkins..not us...so we left...on our way out the group of 6 waiters and waitresses started moving...we stopped at the hostess stand which had 3 girls behind it now and told them the service was horrible and we left. Now we sit at Buffalo Wild Wings on Dezavala..drinking a beer and waiting for our order of wings! Never again Anchor Bar...never again"

The service was inattentive and slow, the nachos and pizza came out ice cold like there wasn't even a heat lamp and the pizza was so soggy and made incorrectly. And then I was overcharged. Asked who the manager was and the server said he didn't know. I used to order wings here, but now they're charging $18 for a 10 piece. How disappointing."

The parking lot is so crammed with cars and yelling, sketchy ass people so watch out or you might get run over or assaulted. The swings at the bar are a cute touch but the questionable patrons make this place a hard pass. $99 for some baby ass shots of Patron and a margarita flight? So not worth it. If you like having to flag down a bartender and like to be patted down and have your bag searched and be stared down by a wanna-be Sheriff, cowboy hat wearing, weird ass security guard, then this place will be heaven for you. Did I mention that the clientele is not the friendliest? No thanks."

We were dancing with these random Haitian girls and this RUDE security guard, Foran, walked up and said control your friend or get out. I was trying to understand what was going on. I don't know the girls or what happened before we got there. So I asked him \"what was going on\" and \"what are you talking about?\" All he kept saying was \"control your friend or leave.\" And he told her she had to sit down or get out. There was no explanation or anything. The more I tried to understand the meaner and more aggressive he got.  On my way out, I walked up to him and said \"hey we were just having a good time dancing. I don't know those girls or what happened before I got there but you were very mean and aggressive. You don't have to be a that mean. I was just trying to figure out what was going on and why we couldn't dance\" he said \"I don't go to your job telling you how to work, don't come to mine to tell me.\" And then he told the other guys near him \"don't let them back in.\" Referring to me and my friend I went there with.  I definitely won't return. Foran didn't say a word to the white girls that were also dancing."

It can get crowded, depending on which day you go, which is mainly Saturday night, and that wasn't very pleasant. They do have issues with keeping the soap and paper towels stocked. They have a food truck that usually serves chicken wings, pork chops, and sometimes tacos and egg rolls and sides like green beans, mac and cheese, etc. Overall it is a good time and a nice place to go."

                "description": "This is a pretty dirty looking bar. The Crawfish boils they put on are ridiculous. There were about 80 people here last Sunday for the $15 AYCE deal. Each time you get in line there are no less than 30 people in line. This went on for 3 hrs from the open at 2. By the way they were 45 mins late from the advertised start serving time.  Anyway, they give you one little french fry tray at a time (about 1/2 a lb of actual crawfish). The average grown Louisianan or hungry Texan can eat 5 lbs. That would be 10 trips at this rate.  After 4 trips, I gave up. I actually ate about 2 lbs for the $15. No difference than going to one of the local restaurants. I heard the day before for the Saturday boil, one man ate 23 trays.  I was also mad at the size of the Crawfish they were known as field runs, the tiniest ones with absolute zero tail meat. Besides my very first tray which was hot and delicious all the rest or cold to lukewarm.   I won't be back to this place. This place just seems like an overhyped sloppily run Place with music and DJs. The restrooms were filthy."

                "description": "This is a Crawfish Boil only review. We visited for All You Can Eat Crawfish on Sunday. We got there just before 1:30 PM and it's supposed to start at 2 PM, but it didn't get rolling until after 2:30 PM. It's $15/person (you pick up your wristband at the bar). It's supposed to include sausage, mini corn cobs, and potatoes. The sausage was in 1\" pieces and the potatoes were sliced (not the little whole red potatoes you might expect). There were also bits of pineapple in it, for some reason. It can catch you off guard if you think it's an onion and you're not expecting something sweet. It was really dark inside the bar, so it was hard to tell at first, but there weren't actually any onions, so we figured it out pretty quickly. There isn't any shaded seating outside, which is why we ate inside. The owner indicated that he would be installing a shade awning, so there will be improvement there shortly.  The crawfish was very spicy, which we liked. Every portion I got came out hot, so no issues there. Each person with a wristband has to stand in line. They'll only give you 1 little tray at a time, which you can eat in about a minute, so it was a little annoying to hardly get any crawfish and then have to go stand in line again for 10 minutes to get another little dish of it. They need to get the bigger trays and hand it out in at least 1-2# portions plus the sides.  After our second tray each, they were already out of sausage and they hadn't been serving for very long. I didn't get any potatoes in trays 5-6, but I'm not sure if that's because they were out or I was just unlucky. After our 2nd ear of corn each, we were saying \"no corn,\" so I'm not sure how long those lasted.  We stood in line for what felt like forever on our last trip - they had stopped serving at one point (presumably to take a break). I left my fiance at the front of the line and I went back to the table. I got 2 new cups of water, and I peeled the heads off a tray of crawfish. They weren't providing anything to put your trash in, so it was just piled up in the middle of the tiny table. I had to find a trash can to toss all the trash, then went to the restroom. While I was in there for a whole 2 minutes, someone decided to bus the table - trashing the 2 new cups of water, the tray of crawfish tails, and a tray of corn and potatoes. Who tf does that?? Super frustrating.  After that BS and standing in lines longer than eating crawfish, we decided to leave. We'd been there for 3 hours (half of that was waiting for the thing to start though). We only ended up eating 12 trays total, which was probably 5-6# of crawfish. I got 2 little ears of corn, and the equivalent of about 1 large potato, and maybe 0.25# of sausage. We felt like we at least got what we paid for, but we probably won't go back there. There are places that are better organized for the crowd and they don't run out of sides in the first half hour.  Note: you can also get chicken-on-a-stick for $6, but it's just frozen, breaded chicken fingers that they skewer and cook.They have remoulade for dipping (tastes ok) and Slap Ya Mama seasoning to dump on everything. The Revolver draught beer we were picking was $5 each, but it wasn't as cold as it should have been. We still got 3 of those though!"

                "description": "Beer and Crawfish!  I've never really heard of a crawfish bar, but this place has it going on! With a name like Bentley's, it's not as fancy and pretentious as you'd think it'd be. A name like Bentley's made me picture a place covered in marble serving Grey Poupon and caviar. This place is quite the opposite.  It's a dark bar with loud music inside. Sometimes, they bring in a band to play on a little stage that they have set up. They have a bunch of craft beers, many of which are somewhat hard to find. I don't think they have a single beer on draft- only bottles and cans.  The best feature of this bar is that they are usually serving up crawfish outside on the patio. They've taken over part of the parking lot, and are building permanent shade structures with picnic tables and a crawfish cooker and a large BBQ grill. They serve up all you can eat crawfish on the weekends. I know I can eat a ton of crawfish, especially ones like the ones they serve here- they're small, but spicy. To be honest, I've never signed up for the crawfish deal, but I do enjoy coming here to watch people stuff their faces with them, and then stand in line for some more. Everything on the outdoor patio is slightly sticky and smells like old crustaceans and hot sauce. The place could use an occasional good hosing down after all that crawfish juice.  It's a nice bar, especially on the outside. It's a great place to kick back outdoors with plenty of seating, and good beers."

They have an indoor stage where they have live music throughout the week. Reasonable drink specials and events such as the crawfish broil on Thursdays and Sundays, and Ribeye on Wednesday's. All in all this is a pretty small local bar that has plenty of potential. Main reason I come here is because of their customer service. Jessie always welcomes his guest with open arms."

Walked in and were greeted by Heidi (one of the owners), she told us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we saddled up to the bar.  Yes, small bar, but very adequate, plenty of tables to sit inside, and outside.   Craving a burger, but not wanting the bun, started reviewing the wraps.  My husband and I both ordered wraps and a order of onion rings.   My Santa Fe with ground beef was wonderful, the cheese was creamy, the beef tender with just a hint of spice.  My husband enjoyed the Alamo wrap and it disappeared.  OH, don't let me forget the salsa she gives you with the wrap, I don't remember what it was but it was super with kick!  The onion rings we shared (small order), was the perfect amount for two people, they were fresh and hot!  We are not dippers, so we did not take Heidi up on the sauces she offered for the rings. If ever back in this neck of the woods, we WILL be back!"

                "description": "Found this gem while treating a Veteran to a lunch on Veterans Day. It's a nice small indoor/large outdoor restaurant. Upon arrival parking was easy and they have plenty of room. You can see a lot of picnic tables and small playground set.   I'm giving 3 stars because the lady who took our order was super rude. I would ask a question and it was met with so much attitude and unwillingness to help. If it wasn't for me treating a friend to lunch I would have completely walked away from this place.   The bright side was that the food turned out really good. We split an order of sweet potato fries bc it's a huge serving. I ordered the Santa Fe wrap which is Pepper Jack, black beans, corn, rice, chipotle spread with avocado (vegetarian option). It was really pleasing, wrap done right. They also have a nice selection room of craft beers."

To me, once they change the buns on the burgers, I want a burger now. I didn't like the buns before, so I started getting the wraps, which are delicious, now I'm hooked on the BLT. Plus this place has a friendly staff, they do get busy, so the wait for food may be awhile, but the beer selection is pretty decent.   One draw back is the bathroom, just one."

They weren't wearing masks or gloves, so keep that in mine when going.  The had a little park thing and a bunch of outside seating, so it's great if you have a family!  We didn't get to try any of the beers.  The Cali club was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The maverick was good but again, there was nothing special about it.  The loaded fries were good, but it wasn't as presentable as I could make it myself at home. It also felt like it had waited out for a while before it got to us.  There was nothing really special about this place, but the food was ok."

It was ok. The sauce tasted like thousand island. Nothing made it special. The menu stated it came with fries, but he didn't get any. I ordered the Hollywood taco. The shredded chicken was GREAT. The price for what I got was high. Just a normal sized taco you would make at home. The tortilla tasted like an Hâ€‘Eâ€‘B tortilla, not bad just ok. The meat was topped with a few kernels of corn and fresh diced jalapeÃ±o. The verde sauce was mediocre. Again nothing special. I added fries to my order and they were good, Very crispy. They were out of fried pickles which was a huge let down since it was one of the reasons we chose to give this place a shot, but I'm not holding it against them with the supply shortages going on right now.  Overall everything was ok, but didn't seem worth the drive or the price."

                "description": "Came here with the family after doing Natural Bridge Caverns. First, be prepared to sit outside, there's not much room inside, especially during the social distancing times. However, even though it was over 90 degrees outside the shade and breeze kept it cool enough to be pleasant. Kids had a playground to okay on - though it was a bit past it's prime.   The ordering seemed a bit haphazzard, which seemed to be due to only have one employee working front of house despite it being rush hour lunch time. This caused me to have to stand at the bar for considerable amounts of time waiting to order or when I went to get a beer. Hopefully this was just someone not showing up for a shift and not a perpetual issue.   Now for the food. I had a Santa Fe wrap. Standard Mexican ingredients, but all together tasty. My wife's burger wrap with fries in the wrap looked quite good. Kids chicken strips were solid quality. The fries had good flavor and crunchy outsides. Beer selection was surprisingly good (Blood and Honey automatically  means I'm happy).   Solid, if not spectacular experience."

The entire wrap was rice, it was so hard to eat because of the amount of rice made the wrap so dry. It hardly had any chicken, mine had maybe a 3 little pieces of chicken bits and about 6 black beans. Just a drop of sauce and no cheese or corn. I should have taken a pic but I had to open mine up to remove the big glob of rice. Same with my friends. Our sons loved their burger and grilled cheese. Next time I will try a burger but for being called wraptitude, I was expecting a good wrap."

The food was really tasty and fries were delicious. The main issue here was that they seemed to be understaffed and weren't set up very well for social distancing. They have a very small seating area and bar inside and several picnic tables and outdoor seating options. While you can spread out just fine outside, you have to go inside of the crowded small building to place your order. It was a very small space with too many people inside close together. Also, the fountain drinks and cups were self-serve set up right next to where everyone was standing. If they had online or outside ordering so that you could avoid going inside, it would really improve things."

                "description": "This was the 1st meal while in Texas, and we dare say it was superb. The guy running the restaurant was super chill and energetic. The atmosphere was relaxing with the eclectic decor.  The hubs had the burger wrap while I had 3 tacos (pork, asada, and avutarian). We also shared the half-loaded fries.  The fries were amazing! Usually with these types of dishes, the fries become soggy or aren't even crispy to begin with. These had a crunch even to the last few pieces. And not to mention, it was loaded with a lot of beef and bacon pieces. What a value for the amount of meat that's in it.  His burger wrap was seriously da bomb. All the 46 sauce and ingredients stuffed inside the wrap was just oozing outwards. The wrap consisted of beef, bacon bits, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions -- pretty much what a burger is. Biting into this was a wowing moment. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My tacos were okay. They weren't superb (standard lettuce, cheese, lime, and tomatillo salsa). I wouldn't rec it as this place isn't known for their tacos:  * Asada: The avocados were creamy. This was prob the freshest and tastiest of the 3 tacos. * Avutarian: The flavors were faint at most. There wasn't much wow or anything that made this taco look nor taste diff. * Pork: The flavors were lacking, and the pork looked super bland (see the only close-up pic worth taking).  Everything about this experience was 5 stars minus my taco choices. The loaded fries and burger wrap were just mind-blowing delicious and at a great price.  Though there were limited parking spaces in the front, the back had plenty of nooks and crannies you could squeeze your car into."

So far I've had the maverick and the big kahuna burgers... both options were delicious and  were cooked just right every time (I hate when burgers are over cooked). I wish I would have taken a picture before I devoured them lol. They have some of the best onion rings out of most places we've tried and fresh crispy fries. Live music line up during spring, summer, and I think into fall on Friday's and Saturday's. The cornhole and play area keep the kiddos busy which is awesome because the kids can work up an appetite while waiting for the food to come out. We love bringing our out of state visitors here because the employees are also so darn nice! Y'all must try it!!!!"

The atmosphere at Grayson is nice and has a trendy feel.   I ordered the crispy fish and a spicy margarita.  I will say the title of the crispy fish dish doesn't do it justice.  It was an amazing pan fried snapper that had a very unique flavor.

Once we were seated, it took a while for food to come out.   Crispy Brussels: really good! Super crispy and comes with a yummy sauce. Great savory app for sharing.  Lavender lemonade: pretty solid cocktail. It tasted more like lemonade than lavender but it's sweet and refreshing.  Chicken and kale salad: heavy on the kale. The chicken, avocado, and cashews are chopped up and mixed in and the kale is also chopped and marinated in the dressing so it's not tough to chew. The dressing is light, which I appreciate. The chicken pieces are small but kind of tough and dry. It's a pretty big salad and very filling.  Everyone agreed their food was pretty average and nothing to rave about, plus it's kind of pricey as expected of the location. The restaurant itself has a nice vibe with a cool bar and TVs. But the average food combined with such a long wait only warrants 3 stars from me."

                "description": "Such a cute place.  Such a great location.  Such incredible potential. Such a missed opportunity.  Having visited Down on Grayson several times I have always found myself feeling underwhemled when all is said and done.   There is plenty of parking to be found in the area so we've never had an issue getting to Down on Grayson.  They do have a beautiful outdoor space, which we've sat at as well as ample indoor seating, which we've also sat at.  Indoor is fine but outdoor is where ya wanna be....weather permitting.  Service has always been acceptable.  Nothing stand-out or to praise but also nothing terrible or warranting any sort of negative attention.  I guess, for me, where Down on Grayson falls short is the food.  The onion rings are good but greasy and a little goes a long way with those.  The Crispy Brussels are fine and the salads I've tried, acceptable.  The \"El Moderno\" Nachos claim to be an \"authentic version of this south of the border favorite\" but if that's autÃ©ntico then gimmie the cheap, knock-off version any day.  Meh. At. Best.    Now look-obviously, I am in the minority here and maybe where they shine is their meat-based menu offerings that this vegetarian doesn't eat, so take my opinion with a grain of salt if you're more on the carnivore end of the spectrum. For me, this isn't a place I suggest nor is it a place I must take people.  It's mostly a really pretty patio to grab a drink and then head elsewhere for dinner.  That's my ideal Down on Grayson experience."

                "description": "I've passed Down on Grayson many times while at the Pearl and was finally able to dine here for a late lunch/early dinner. Covered reserved parking (for this restaurant only) is available just a few steps away from the entrance. Since it was an off hour (3:30pm), there was no wait for a table. We chose to sit inside, but there is seating outdoors as well. They are also dog-friendly (outdoor seating only).  I started off with a Ranch Water, which has dulce vida blanco tequila, fresh lime juice, and topo chico. The Topo Chico was a bit flat, but the drink aesthetics was on point. Not really worth the $12 price tag in my opinion, but I had to try it since I've never officially tried ranch water before.  The Shishito Peppers ($12) appetizer was definitely a great surprise. The portion size of the peppers was way bigger than I expected, and the peppers themselves were cooked very nicely with a slightly blistered skin. The accompanying sriracha mayo balanced the heat of the peppers.  For the main, I got Fish Tacos ($16). They were one of the best fish tacos I've ever had! The large filets of fish were perfectly cooked and juicy, and the spiciness of the seasoning paired well with the fixin's (i.e. cole slaw, avocado, tomato, red onion, salsa, lime juice, cilantro) on top. It's a must-try item!  Service was also great from beginning to end. Our waitress was prompt and very friendly but didn't overdo it with checking up on us. Even the hostess seated us with a smile, which many restaurant hosts/hostesses fail to do.  Definitely a great place to grab delicious food and drinks!  [An added bonus is the decor in the women's restroom--cute, framed paintings of dogs!]"

                "description": "Decided to stop by for an early dinner after returning some golf shorts that were SEE THROUGH at Nike. Was not expecting much even though it has pretty solid reviews but to my surprise everything was great!   I started off with the Grayhound cocktail which was basically grapefruit juice and vodka. If you like grapefruit, you have got to get this drink. Super refreshing after a nice walk from the parking lot in the 100 degree weather!   For the appetizer I decided to try out the Shishito peppers and they were pretty good. Perfectly charred and it also came with a light dipping sauce that did not take away from the natural flavors of the pepper.   The main attraction for me was the fire roasted chicken. Tuesday afternoon means we must choose healthier options so of course I had to go with a chicken breast. The chicken breast was huge and was attached to the bone with a nice fire roasted skin on top. The breast itself was nice and tender but not too tender. I'd say it was a perfectly grilled/fire roasted chicken breast. It was also lightly sauced with a honey sauce which complimented the corn well because the corn had just a little heat to it. The corn was sweet and fresh and you could tell that it comes from the cob instead of a frozen bag.   Our waitress was cool too and was very friendly and the service was great. Overall this is a great spot to hang out at because they have good food and a wide variety of drinks!"

We only had starter plates and it was enough. The drink where amazing!! You definitely get what you pay for and you don't feel like they are cheating you either.  There was a wait so we decided to sit at the bar. The bar tenders are on point when it comes to memorizing the specials of the day and making bom ass drink!!!  Definitely a 10/10 experience and I will definitely be back!!!"

                "description": "Meh. Food was good enough, but going to what i thought was mid scale or better, i was surprised to find being treated like it is a ghetto sports bar in a bad neighborhood.   Go there with your wife on an after church jaunt and sit at the bar. You will be greeted with the need of a credit card to \"open a tab\" or you cant sit and eat.   Weird policy for a non low end sports bar. Made the experience seem low scale, even though prices say they aren't .   Burger was good, salad was fine. If i sat at a table i would haven't been treated like a 'thief in waiting', but i won't be back to try that experience.  Edit: vindicated already.  Guy and wife sat next to me, they ordered and got the official ask for your card line and looked he at bartender awkwardly.  It not normal and makes high end customers off put to have it happen"

I'm not even a vegetarian but this sandwich is so fresh and so good, I simply have to get it.  Love their outdoor patio dining- both kid and dog friendly.  The vibe here is very relaxed and there is something on the menu for everyone.  The one thing I will say is don't come here if you are in a hurry as the service and food tend to take their time...which I'm fine with but just know going into this experience it's gonna be a while.    Every plate that walks by looks more delicious than the next.  I have not tried the desserts but today I saw another table get the strawberry cake and it looked delicious- one slice was about a 1/4 of a whole cake, very shareable.    Love dining here on Sundays for lunch then walking around the Pearl Farmers Market."

                "description": "I have to say. I was torn between writing this review and just waiting to see if I could give them one more shot. Sadly tho, I went with the review for a number of reasons. The main one being the fact that I was so excited to finally try this supposed gem tucked away near the Pearl District. I have been to the the Pearl several times but always with my kiddos so I chose the food places near the water area each time. Today I was child free and it was just my oldest daughter and myself so we happily walked on over after running errands in the area.  Went inside. Greeted by a very friendly host at the stand by the door. (He gets the mandatory 1*) Good little wait, so we went to the bar to grab a cold water to cool us down before our table was ready.  Got our table quicker than they anticipated, so we were stoked. Unfortunately, it was a huge LET-DOWN. Our server seemed upset. We had to say the first hello. She never smiled. Never said a word other than to ask about drink choices, if we were ready to order, or to answer a question we may have had. Ordered our food. Food was delivered and... that's the last we saw of her. She literally set the plates down and immediately walked away.  My daughter needed a couple more things and we wanted to place a to-go order for my parents, but alas. We never saw her a single time we were eating. As I looked around I saw all these other servers going to their tables and asking how everything was, could they get them anything else, etc. and there I was wondering to myself 'why couldn't that be my server'...  We sat after finishing our food and pushed our plates aside as to kind of give an indication we were finished, but still. Nothing. Finally I made eye contact with another server and she came over. We asked for a couple boxes and the check. The manager comes a couple minutes later with them and we pay. We obviously didn't order the to-go.  I was so disappointed. Sad actually. This place gets so much business and they have wonderful food. There is zero reason anyone who comes thru their doors should receive anything close to the service we got.  I am going to have to assume most of the reviews are from regulars that frequent often and are pampered because I cannot imagine them making it the way they have and having the reputation they have based on what I experienced today. Just a big NO from me."

                "description": "This place is a delight. We came on Halloween evening after an adventurous weekend. Charming neighborhood and SUCH a beautiful building. We got a little lost exiting after dinner, and ended up inadvertently exploring the various dining areas. It's really impressive and spacious and each room is interesting with its own style. It's startlingly cool - but do I belong here? Do you? We both do! How? It's welcoming in addition to the impressive physical environment. Really lovely staff. FANTASTIC music. Somebody's got exquisite taste in there. I was frustrated for a millisecond when a table of empty-nesters sat down nearby and their chatter drowned out the playlist, but then the eavesdropping was great too. So I'm going to go ahead and credit Liberty Bar with that portion of my experience as well: I appreciate the acoustics! - Perfect for fun conversation with your table companion OR listening in on another group of people trying not to insult their own children too much. Ach. Those children - they were so lazy... but had the biggest hearts!  So you don't care about this? What? Okay - the food: DELICIOUS. We had the fish taco appetizer, a salad with asparagus and portobello mushrooms, and a really, really fabulous lamb burger (medium: perfection). The fries were crispy-perfect. Oh yeah - some chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert. So good. I never get dessert at restaurants, but if you do or if you don't - consider getting it here.  We came to San Antonio for a little birthday / long-weekend getaway and had a blast. The Liberty Bar was one of the highlights. If I move[d] here, I'd want to find a place as close as possible to the Liberty Bar so I could become a regular. Good gawd, it's life-affirming."

There were seating availabilities and a staff to get us seated right away.  It did take a little extra time for us to get our drink orders in, but no complaints. Food came out in a timely manner compared to time to order and everything was delicious.  I recommend the eggs Benedict which comes with extra thin and crunchy fries that are my favorite!  Also, can't go wrong with the french toast that was soaked for 48 hours!  We felt like fatties, but well worth it.  I definitely recommend brunch here with the quiet ambience and great food."

Watch the address close because it's not obvious this is the right location, as it looks like an old Convent which is exactly what it is. Painted bright pink concrete walls will greet you. Being a Sunday at late lunch only the upstairs was open but there is ample seating downstairs for busier times. Nice long bar with just about any kind of alcohol you can imagine and a very fun creative menu. Grab a book and sit down to read if you liked as there are plenty in book shelves on the walls. The only reason why I didn't rate it a perfect five was due to the service. It really wasn't very busy but we had a hard time finding our waiter when we needed him. He seemed to be tired and didn't make any suggestions about the menu or seemed excited to be there. Other than that it was a great experience and we definitely will be back."

                "description": "I had a great overall experience at the Liberty Bar. Currently, they are only offering outdoor dining but they have a great outdoor area with numerous tables, palm trees, and string lights which makes for a nice ambiance. While the service was a bit slow on a Saturday night, the waiters were friendly and kept us updated. We started with the bread assortment which must have had 4 or 5 different types of bread, all of which were good. I had the falafel sandwich as my main and it was a very large portion. I really enjoyed the dish and came with an option of a side salad or fries."

                "description": "Where to eat on a busy Saturday night out during the peak in the pandemic? Outside! In the cold! We stumbled into Liberty Bar because we were specifically looking to eat in South Town and eat outside. Unfortunately for us, Liberty Bar's owner has refused to buy outdoor heating- we were told outdoor dining is only because of the pandemic. Well, we decided to eat and run- bad decision, here's why: the cost is exorbitant for the food!  My burger was small and the sourdough bun was greasy as hell. The side salad had a dressing that also tasted like oil. The good news was the plate suggested by the waiter- beef tips, was a hit. Our margaritas had tequila but were served in super small glasses. I was floored by the cost of our meal- 90 dollars. Bank robbery for the food- with the cost so high... buy a few outdoor heaters! Two stars for the amazing waitstaff but the food, atmosphere and price results in  'Stay Away!!'"

                "description": "I have always loved the vibes at liberty bar. Such a fun spot in Southtown, picture worthy!   They are currently open during COVID with outside seating only. It seems as though they are still figuring that all out. We went over this past weekend and got on the waitlist but their systems are off as they don't seem to have a host/hostess and their waitstaff are left to figure out who gets seated, when and where. Of course, we will always be patient with wait staff these days as they are figuring out how to work in this new environment.   There drinks are phenomenal, we got the mimosas and bloody Maria's. I highly recommend the bloody Maria's!"

Kick back and chat or watch the guys knock it out in the open kitchen. Josh was our tender of the bar. He is outstanding!! Very knowledgeable and friendly. He recommended several things and was spot on. More people like Josh please, straight forward and makes it simple. Great place to stop in for a quick bite and a drink. The pizza is solid btw."

The sign says to sit yourself and when we did, a waiter made us get up for a couple. We ended up getting shoved into a small table for our party.   The drinks were decent price and heavy poured which was ok for the setting.  Garlic aioli was lacking flavor and the kale chips were disappointing. It was the consistency of smashed and broken up kale.   Wouldn't recommend for apps. Better places nearby to get drinks if you want food too."

                "description": "I am furious right now and deeply upset that I wasted gas to drive here and $100 on what is one of the worst dining experiences of my life!!  Years ago we visited Liberty Bar and always loved it so to celebrate my new job we decided to revisit this place but it was a poor decision!!  Service was ABYSMAL!!! 10 minutes to even get acknowledged, had to ask for silverware and never did get a glass for my beer! My husband just pounded his water and gave me his glass!  We began with the roast garlic and bread and that was good, just as I remembered it!! The kale chips were okay - a little greasy and in need of salt. The mains were bad. My daughter got a grilled cheese which was just solid chucks of unmelted cheese - if the waitress had bothered to come anywhere near our table I would have sent it back! The fries were overcooked and my husbands lamb burger was certainly not medium.  We had always liked the Geranium cream so ordered that for dessert - it was HORRIBLE!! I told my husband we should send it back but for some reason he appeared to like it! It was warm which is not good for a dairy item and just appeared to be a stodgy mass of cream cheese with a hint of flavor!!  Add lukewarm beer, warm to the touch root beer and the fact that we sat the entire  meal with empty appetizer plates on our table - we were not offered drink refills until the end when clearly she did not really want to get drinks as she already had the receipt in her hand !  I feel sick from the one bite of the nasty warm dessert right now and sick to my stomach that I wasted money and gas to drive to this meal! A quick peak at my Yelp will show that I mostly give out 4/5 stars.... so yes it was that bad!! Will not return!"

                "description": "Went for brunch on Saturday. Attentive and genial service from Alejandro.   As a matter of fact, all the employees were so friendly and welcoming.   The manager Craig replied to my yelp question about parking within minutes. That responsiveness is very rare and was a strong show of hospitality that made us decide to come.  Parking is on the side of building, and also on the gravel across the street.  I have to say there was alot that I instantly loved and that is original. The venue and vibe, for example, is uptown casual, a mixed crowd but a good helping of the smart set. The staff keeps it comfy so you can come as you are.   I had the omelette luego. It had zuchinni, onions, tomato, and gruyere. They cook the egg then fold it around the veggies. I prefer my omelette integrated but it was still good. I opted for no black beans, and requested double \"ranchero\" potatoes.  The sourdough toast with apricot marmelaide was a nice compliment!  The \"ranchero\" potatoes are sort of saucy or stewey, not roasted. I did not like. However, my companion, who ordered the \"simple breakfast,\" eggs, sausage, potatoes, and toast, traded me. I ate his roasted taters and he ate my saucy ones. So it worked out!  We shared a thick slice of French toast for \"dessert.\" It was delicious!  When Alejandro mentioned that all the breads and desserts were made in house, I wanted more. So I ordered a slice of apple pie and coconut pineapple cake to go.   I haven't eaten them yet but they look so delicious and based on today's experience I know they are!"

                "description": "The place is small and intimate inside with a nice open patio outside. The atmosphere and its patrons were very chill and fun. People were laughing and enjoying each others company. There aren't servers so you have to go to the bar to order food and drinks. The menu is small for food (bar food) but there was a wealth of beers on tap. Bonus: two different types of Yuengling but no Black and Tan. Texas may have to wait a while longer for that one to get here.   The female bartender was a little (a lot) lost. Each time I said an item I wanted she said, \"is that it?\" which made me think that she wasn't taught the art up upselling yet but that's another story. I ordered food and my drink and then my husband ordered his food and drink. He offered a card and she said she \"didn't think she needed that\" but then put our order as to-go. ??? We went back to our table and realized that other tables had table tents so I went back and asked if I needed a number and they were like, oh yea! How about this number? And handed me a table tent. We waited about 40 minutes for wings and meatballs.   The Yuengling on tap - not warm but not cold. Meh.  The wine - La Crema Pinot noir. I ask the female bartender if they had Pinot Noir and she said, \"oh this?\" with a very confused look on her face and showed me a bottle of Chardonnay. Um, no.   Anyway, our food was finally brought out. The wings had a decent flavor but they weren't hot and they were slimy and gummy. Yuck. He asked for blue cheese and he got ranch and one empty and dirty ramekin??? The meatballs were previously frozen, in my opinion, but weren't too bad. But they weren't hot either.  In the middle of waiting on our food, the female bartender came up and tried to had us a very watered down drink I had noticed at the bar when ordering twenty minutes prior. She asked if we ordered this drink and when we said no, she continued to ask around to find the right person.   The piece de resistance was our bill. Everything was of a normal price but my glass of wine...was TEN DOLLARS. La Crema normally sells for about 12-15 for a bottle. I get a mark up to make a profit, but dude. That's just rude.    This place truly has potential but they need to step it up a notch on hot food and maybe a once around from the bartender to check on patrons and to bus some tables. I say this because a gentleman next to us very jokingly but vocally said, \"pardon me while I bus my table\" as he went back and forth 3 times to empty his table of empty glasses and dishes from the people at his table.   On the pulse side, everyone was very cordial and had great attitudes.  Over all, I give it a 6.1."

                "description": "My all women's volunteer organization hosted a fund raiser trivia night at this bar.  When I got there, I was worried we wouldn't have enough room or tables for the group, but we ended up being fine. It's a small place for a large group, but they were attentive and accommodating. There seemed to be a limited staff working (maybe 3?) but the service was good.   Food menu is small but has some good looking options. It's not on the overhead electronic screens (drinks only) but there are laminated menus around. And pictures posted on the business' Yelp page.  They also have a water cooler (like the kind you have at football games) so you can get water whenever you want.   This is a fun little bar in a strip of other businesses. It may get looked over but if you are in the area, it would be a good place to check out.   The fun: Lots of drink choices with a wide variety of IPAs. All 4 people at our table enjoyed what they had. The Purple Haze was a hit with another at our table. I enjoyed the Crackberry cider. It was a little more tart than I usualoy like, but I thought it was a decent cider. Also some canned and bottled beverages. Max was behind the bar for our event, and he was very friendly. He also handled our large group well.   The less than ideal: The electronic menu keeps changing what is shown on the screen. There are 2 screens. There are 2 pages for the drink menu. However, the part of the menu displayed on each screen changes when the circle at the bottom fills up. It's not really enough time to read everything on one screen before it changes and you have to try to find your place again on the other screen. And some of the drink listed online aren't on the screen (specifically the 1 of 2 tap ciders I saw online). Oh, and there is only 1 women's restroom."

Claude Hoppers is pretty far out of my way but it's still a grand time when I get to go. They have a nice selection of beer, on par with your local Big Hops, and a mix of high and low seating, as well as a nice outdoor patio.  I had a first date here and when he went to the bathroom, the bartender was eavesdropping a bit and excitedly ran up to me to squeal, \"Is this a first date!? He's SO hot, where did you find him!?\" So that was pretty adorable.  Pub Trivia is always a blast here, too. It's hosted by Geeks Who Drink, whose format I absolutely love. Build up a team, have a pint, and spend an evening at Claude Hoppers!"

They play primarily reggae music and have about 50 beers on tap that is listed on a screen with the price and alcohol percentage.   The downside of this place is their cleanliness, service, and beer knowledge. We went there and everyone ordered the Ballast Point Grunion Pale Ale. When we drank it though, we knew it wasn't the actual beer and the bartender insisted that it was. Lucky for us, we were with a Ballast Point distributor so he looked at the tap and confirmed that it in fact wasn't the beer we had requested.   The service was highly lacking. There was one lady working and maybe 10 at most people in the place. But it was fairly calm, yet she didn't walk around to ask us if we need more after our empty glasses sat there for over 15 minutes. As for cleanliness, the toilet paper and paper towels were empty in the restroom. Also, there was a pile of looks like swept up trash just sitting on the ground near a table. Sadly, I wish this place was better, but I don't see myself coming back."

Dustin cared more about socializing with his friends at the bar than trying to help anyone. There were only 6 people here and I see why. Will not be returning."

                "description": "Before I dig into this review, I'd like to say I've been to numerous growler stations and think I've developed a pretty good basis of comparison/ expectations.   This place is super far from San Antonio.  Okay I got that out the way.  There's plenty of parking and indoor/outdoor seating.  The outdoor patio is set up kind of like a beer garden, but there's no walk-up window service.  There is wait staff though, so that's cool.  Immediately I was impressed with the selection of beers.  Not sure how often they change them, but for a first timer it was a change for sure.  The indoor area has booths, high-tops, bar seating and a little cove in the back.  Liking that.  The staff was cool too.  The food is better than bar food.  I mean they offer humus and pulled pork tacos.  Whaaaaaat?!   Some things I really didn't care for were no  1/2 pours, flights and condiment taster cups.  If I'm willing to commit to paying a little extra for craft beer, then I'm definitely not okay with plastic taster cups.  Every other craft beer spot offers glass tasters.   I understand they offer flights now, since my visit about 3 weeks ago.  Pros: Beer selection FOOD (Most growler spots don't have food) Parking Growler prices Drink growlers on premises   Cons: No Flights No  1/2 pours (must commit to full 16oz) Distance Plastic taster cups No designated tap handles"

                "description": "So, I was able to score a Groupon for this particular place awhile back and wanted to get a really good deal on a growler fill. First off could this place be any further from the city?!! It was like I could see the Eiffel Tower on the next block! Secondly I was anticipating a much bigger space, as all the pictures I saw of it gave me that impression. However, what I've learned as I Yelp is that the disparity between perception and actual experience can be great.  As you enter here a really cool iron fence with ornate lighting opens up the patio, with ample seating and tables to match. By comparison the taproom is relatively small. The interior itself is both sleek and cozy. A small bar area with a few high chairs/ tables gives me the impression the intent of the owner was to create an intimate experience. In contrast it is a refreshing departure from the noise and bustle of other tap rooms. But then again there are people that gravitate toward a busy, crowded bar.  The growler/tap station itself is a small counter space with a healthy beer selection alongside a wall. In addition a small screen displays beers by name, price and alcohol content. Since this location is in Stone Oak prices are in fitting with this area. For example a simple pour of the Real Ale's, \"Mysterium Verum Kraken\" a rare tap, will set you back $12. Definitely expect to pay a little more than the typical taproom you might frequent, if you choose to come here.  In terms of service the tapmaster was very professional. I like how she moved from patron to patron, able to take orders and fill pours. She knew customers on a first name basis but more importantly knew their drink of choice; which speaks volumes of this establishment. In my tattered slip-on Vans I collected my growler of Karbach's \"Krunkin Pumkin\" and headed on out.   My only critiques of this spot would be I wish they would post on their page the prices for their beers. And the distance. If this was in the Deco District area I would probably hit this place up more frequently. Still Claude Hopper's is a really cool tap/growler station with a sleek layout. The vibe is laid back, the beer selection is good, the patio is perfect for conversation and the service is excellent. And I think a Friday night after work is the optimal time to get \"Krunkin!\""

                "description": "Cute little spot nestled in the heart of \"downtown\" Bulverde. It's very spacious spot with a vibe to suit everyone from a beer garden with a large screen tv, to a relaxing porch, bar seating, lounge area with couches, or a more traditional restaurant seating style area. If you happen to be there on a Friday or Saturday evening you'll be in luck for live music as well.  The wine menu is very extensive but I was little bummed to see they only offer wine flights during the week and not the weekend :( . We had several different waitresses checking on our table and unfortunately none were very well versed In wine recommendations so be advised that you may have to just choose blindly and hope for the best.   No wine drinking outing is complete without having a variety of meats and cheeses to accompany your beverage so my friend and I split the meat and cheese board. Their is a short menu of reasonably priced tapas and pizzas that you can choose from as well. The waitress delivered the meat and cheese board with no explanation of what was on the board-so again just kind of jumped in blindly and figured it out as we went.  All in all, I enjoyed a pleasant evening drinking wine on the porch of Wine 101 but I'm not sure I'd make the drive from San Antonio to Bulverde just to go this place alone. If you're already in the area it's worth stopping in for a glass or two."

                "description": "Well if your team has to play Pieper Ranch, then I think this is a must stop before the game. :) it's 8 minutes away and it is absolutely adorable.  I wanted to sit everywhere! They have a fabulous bar, a cool chill biergarten, some covered patio tables (my choice), a living roomish area, and some nice tables in the back back that could be used for a restaurant area or a party or a tasting menu.  And lining the walls of the back room are the personalized glasses of the regular patrons.  I even saw some glasses with paper in them, which makes me think they leave each other notes (or free drinks). SO CUTE!   I ordered a fight of wine and the meat and cheese tray.  Let me start by saying that I love Cru. The flight was fine, but all tastings were the same vineyard.  None were particularly fantastic. The meat and cheese tray was HUGE, but... quantity over quality. Also, I have no idea if the selections were local or from the HEB, bc they didn't provide a card or any info about the choices.  This would be a great chance to pair with some local cheese or sausage makers (IMO) but none (except what I think may have been capicollo) were particularly amazing.  Not judging, but it seems more geared toward some \"manly men\" that come in with their gals, than a \"wine\" board.  I would definitely choose from their hot menu, when I return.  It was good. Just not fancy-pants.  (No stinky cheese! Lol). My bill was 45$ for the flight, the board and one more glass of wine.  I felt like that was a little high for the quality, but the experience (and quantity of food) made up for it. They def have some cheaper options (especially during happy hour) that I didn't take advantage of.  Everyone that worked there was super polite, I didn't ask many questions so idk if they were particularly knowledgeable, but they sure have a bunch of different wines!  Regardless of my criticisms, I really enjoyed myself, and my experience and I would absolutely return when I'm in the area again."

The wines were pretty good and the cheese plate was huge. It had several different types of cheese, each of which came in several chunks. While we did enjoy the amount of food, we thought slight improvements could be made. The plate came with hummus, pita, and crackers. There was a ton of pita for the hummus, but only a few crackers for a ton of cheese. It would have been better if the ratios were switched.   The staff was friendly and they have several rooms for indoor and outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend this spot of a date night or girl's night, especially when the weather is nice."

The wine bar is in a old house that was built sometime in the early 1900's, very rustic and quaint.   We walked into the bar area and were greeted by friendly staff. We told them it was our first time there. We were told to look around and sit anywhere we liked. My friend and I sat in the back part of the house where they had comfortable couches and tables here and there and the walls were lined with hundreds of different kinds of wine. Our waitress was awesome very knowledgeable about the wine. Lucky for us it was happy hour. Happy hour is 4pm to 6:30 daily. Choice wines are $5.00 per glass.   They also serve tapas , appetizers and their version of pizza. We tried their meat and cheese board and their chocolate truffles. Great food to drink with while sipping wine and chatting.   I will definitely be back to try other wines and bring back some of our friends and neighbors. Would highly recommend checking it out, get there early so you can get a good spot to sit, chat and drink wine."

This type of service is nonexistent anymore.   They have an amazing wine selection, but the secret here is the Wine Club.  For $50 per month, you get your choice ow 2 white, 2 red, of 1 of each, along with a storage cubby to hold your bottles in (can't always make it out here every month), and 2 personal engraved wine glasses.  They charge your card around the 1 week of each month, put your bottles in your own personal cubby, and you walk in, grab your choice, and they open it and pour it.  It's almost like drinking for free! Not really, it's more like pre-paying for your drinking, but still...  They have a small menu, flatbread pizza, wings, etc... The food is good, but you are really here for the wine so grab your bottle and enjoy."

                "description": "This in my opinion was one of the better meals I have had in a long time. We were a large party of 8 and all had different meals. They were all so unique and different packed full of flavor and fun. Our waitress Carson was extra sweet and seemed to make it a priority to make great small talk.   I had the Diablo burger and paid extra for a premium side. They make their own tater tots and they were filled with jalapeÃ±os, cheddar cheese and cream cheese. They had a little extra crunch to them but were like nothing I had before.   We shared the apple pie cheesecake which was also good. I would not call it great and a must have but I also think that is because I may have overeaten my meal because it was so divine."

That's why we are continuing to take precautionary measures to ensure proper sanitization and minimal contact for all your orders.\"  Given this statement it seemed odd that no one in the place (except for me) was wearing masks, and the tables weren't spaced far apart. I would be very uncomfortable dining in here. But my order was for pickup.   I ordered a Caesar salad. The online menu says there's a balsamic reduction, but it was nowhere to be found. That's unfortunate. The salad was a decent size. The dressing was good. It seemed like it was yogurt based. It needed something. Maybe more garlic, or some salt.  The Parmesan crisps were a nice touch, and weren't mentioned on the menu, so maybe they took the place of the balsamic reduction. It's a fair trade off.   I'm on a low fat diet due to some recent health issues, so I think the rest of their menu is off limits for me."

They definitely have different things that make you explore and try new things! I was iffy with my Diablo burger but man it was the best combination of sweet, spicy, and meaty! The chips with queso was ok, the chips were a little stale and queso was clumpy. The service was amazing, friendly, and swift. Everyone was happy to help and knew their menus pretty well. Our server was also very experienced when it came to draft and crafted beers along with spirits and fund drinks! I would most definitely come back! My mouth is watering just thinking about this place"

Wait staff was friendly and efficient.   We stopped here on our way up to Austin to celebrate our anniversary. I went with the Mexican Street Food Burger, I think that was the name? â€ Anyways it was a burger that had a bunch of things on it including Mexican Street Corn. It came with fries which I upgraded to Poutine Fries because why wouldn't I on our anniversary it's time to celebrate. Wifey got Shrimp Tacos with pickled onions on top and I believe some kind of Asian style seasoning. Her meal came with fries as well which she said were good but once she tried my poutine fries she quickly wished she upgraded. We shared my fries because hey it was our anniversary and I'm a nice guy (sometimes).   Overall a good dinning experience. Would reccomend and would return."

                "description": "Stopped by tonight because I saw the Spicy Juicy Lucy listed as one of the best burgers in San Antonio/New Braunfels. Arrived right at five and seated very quickly on the cute patio. Service was quick, and my mouthwatering burger arrived promptly. Definitely lived up to the hype, stuffed with creamy pimiento cheese and stacked high with all the good, non-healthy stuff. Just the right amount of spice too, more about flavor than intense heat. I devoured it quickly because the bun could barely hold it all and I just couldn't resist. So tasty.  Also, the service here was so amazing. My sweet waitress came out to tell me they were fixing my order to get me the sweet potato fries I ordered instead of regular fries. I hadn't even noticed the mistake! I ended up with both sets of fries, and then they didn't charge me for either to make up for their mistake. Superb customer service that sealed the deal for me. Going to recommend this place highly to everyone I know. Hoping to try another burger here soon!"

Great outdoor space, but it was thunderstorming while we were there.   $17 for a burger and fries is pretty steep though. I got the Scape Goat and the thin beef patty didn't even come close to covering the bottom bun. Disappointing for a burger at that price point. It was flavorful though. Parmesan aioli fries were an up charge; they were pretty delicious.   Basic cheeseburger was deliciously messy and the side salad was beautiful!   We tried the Muck Mule, Peach Sangria, and I had a sample of the Flamingo Fruit beer. All were very good.   Give this New Braunfels gem a try when you're visiting or just passing through!"

The wait was kind of nuts but you are welcome to walk on over to the bar and find some outdoor seating while you wait for a table. It did rain all over us because they don't have a legit cover for outdoor seats but all of that was forgotten when the food came out.   Their fried green tomatoes and onion rings are phenomenal. The burgers were HUGE and they did not shy away from any toppings or condiments. One of our burgers came with an entire bowl of queso to dip or pour. I got a burg with jalapenos and it was so spicy, I had to take some off lol. Delicious meal and very kind service."

Every burger we ate was specialized and the buns and burgers seemed handcrafted! The Buffalo was watchful. There was outdoor and indoor seating available.  The waitress Kristin was super awesome and amazing and she gave super recommendations!  The menu had different options available. This is also very close to the main circle and river in New Braunfels. The wait can be long in the tourist season. The last day Schlitterbahn was open, we walked right in and got a table at about 645 pm, so it might be slowing down a bit so locals can stop by. We live in Converse and will be back!  We were so full and could not even try the amazing desserts!  Next time..."

The employees are nice and they're good at their jobs. It's close to the Comal river. Now, the food!  Muck and Fuss (don't say it too fast or you'll end up throwing an f-bomb) has SUCH good food!  They have a nice variety of dishes like; appetizers and gourmet burgers, sandwiches and tacos, \"boozy shakes\" or not boozy shakes, and cheesecake for dessert  (unless you want a cocktail for dessert).  Speaking of cocktails, their cocktails and craft beer are SO tasty (and strong) and will get you in trouble if you're not careful. The only complaint I have is the prices.  A couple can easily develop a $50 tab for lunch.  In south Texas, that's kinda pricey. The hub's and I have eaten at MandF a number of times and the meals are consistently yummy and the employees are consistently great.  We just don't eat there as much as we'd like because of the cost. Even with the high prices, I recommend Muck and Fuss!"

We were told we would have to wait an hour for a table of 5 but ended up waiting only 30 minutes or so. We were seated on the patio but had shade and a breeze, so it was pleasant until it threatened to rain, and the host very politely let us know and set a table for us inside. After we moved, it downpoured, so that was very thoughtful!  Our server was very sweet and attentive. We never had empty drinks, and our food was all delivered timely and was hot. I ordered the Scapegoat burger with a side salad. I shared some poutine with my sister. And we got some chips and queso for the table, which was delish. All the food was really good. The Scapegoat with its gooey and melty goat cheese paired with pepper jelly was excellent, great flavor. I should have tried the Asian slaw. The side salad and dressing were good (and fresh), but there isn't much to write about it. The poutine was amazing. It has a mushroom gravy, and my sister hates mushrooms, but she actually loved the poutine.   I didn't get any alcoholic beverages, but it did look like they had a good tap list and some fun cocktails. Note they have Maine Root sodas, so if you are a die-hard Coke or Pepsi lover, the soft drinks are a little different. Two members of my party didn't really care for them. The iced tea was good.   Overall, prices are fair, service is top notch, and the food is worth whatever long wait time they may have!"

It was a margarita, a mule, sangria and the prince solms sipper.  For food, I ordered the special of the week. It was a sandwich with pimento cheese stuffed fried avocado and a side salad. It truly was perfection. I did also try their Mac and cheese and it was super good. I guess I love cheese and everything I ate had it.  On a Sunday for brunch, it was busy, but we only waited about 20 minutes. We did get seated at the bar. It can get tight, but so worth it.   They have inside and outside seating."

Either way, this is a cool, low key joint. Best part is that they serve both wine AND coffee! They are the same company as Wicked Voodoo Coffee, and its super interesting that they have a wine and coffee bar. I love it! The concept and the place is so unique. They also have legit charcuterie boards. The staff here is also extremely sweet and nice. Great customer service, amazing ambience, and a great place to bring friends. They also have a private seating area if you wanted to reserve for a large party. If wine and coffee are your jam, this is a perfect place for you!"

I really can't explain how detail oriented they are towards picking the right blend of foods that go so well with their wine offerings.  The bartender/host Stuart was AMAZING. She helped us navigate our flight of wines and has almost perfect recommendations.  I would come here everyday if I could. Being right next to I-35 makes it a short drive for me when commuting, and there was plenty of spots to park even though it was busy."

Then there is Melinda, who was primarily taking care of us.  She was subbing in from one of their drive-thru locations due to being short-staffed, and she was flat-out nails!  Great personality, extremely helpful, and just a lot of fun to talk with. My wife did have the munchies and ordered the bacon donuts, not really reading the description...obviously missing the 'mountain' in the title.  This is enough to feed Joey Chestnut...a huge pile of freshly made rings, topped with bacon and a sticky-sweet glaze...with a side of healthy fresh berries.  My wife has breakfast for the next few days. Great wine selection...coffee smelled great, but did not have any (got a bag of beans to go), and truly outstanding people... We will go out of our way to visit again, for these experiences, even in today's climate, are rare. You will not be disappointed."

The bartender, Cesar was great to chat with and offered some excellent suggestions for food and drink. He makes a really good Old Fashioned too! Their spicy fried Â¼ chicken was pretty good and came with a really nice and hot hot sauce! Their side of mac and cheese that came with it was really cheesy, gooey and yummy! There was also a huge amount that came with it! They have an interesting and large menu loaded with some pretty nice southern favs. I would definitely return!"

We could tell the biscuits were from a can and then tossed in a fryer and yet things from the fryer weren't even hot. We had a reservation for 10:15 but you didn't really need it. There were plenty of tables for brunch which should have been a hint. The coffee was very bitter, if you're into that then you'll like it. The appetizer, sausage corn pups or something like that came out really quick and luke warm. It seemed they were sitting there for a while. I probably won't come back for brunch."

Not sure if tonight was an off night, but it seemed that they couldn't get orders correct and there was a lack of urgency for all of the patrons eating. There was a common trend of tables requesting for items that they ordered and flagging down waitstaff to be helped. I waited 48 minutes for my rotisserie chicken and side salad because the \"ticket was lost\". The table next me had parts of their order missing and I overheard them ask for their missing food as well.   Over all the food that we received was great."

                "description": "Came here with girlfriends to celebrate friendships and girls night out!   This location is perfect as you get to enjoy dinner, drinks and a lot of entertainment around you or just sit and people watch.  Reservations were a breeze on open table and we were seated right on time.   What I - the menu, the prices, the choices, clean restaurant. The TVs at the bar and the patio seating just makes this a restaurant with a lot of potential to be a favorite.  Our food experience however was not the best. I think the branding dish here is the fried chicken and we all hit the spicy chicken. The girls added Mac and cheese and I chose the greens as a side. The honey biscuit was of course delicious as you can't go around with fried dipped in honey ...yummy!  The chicken was  nothing special at all. I was expecting this incredible memorable bite full of crunch and flavor...meh. Max wine dive restaurant chicken left me with this response not this place. I also wasn't spicy not very hot in temp.  The greens also were luke warm and loaded with bacon. I love the southern touch but I personally would ask for a little more green than meat. I'm glad I didn't get the Mac n cheese as this was not very creamy, hot or impressive either. Pretty much it was a lackluster eating experience.  I don't now how my gumbo went to terribly wrong but it did leading to 3 failed tries. All I asked for was gumbo (super hot) with no rice. 1st cup comes out borderline cold. 2nd cup comes out thick warmed up full of sticky rice. Last cup was what I presume kitchen making a quick roux and throwing in sausages and that's what I got. I gave up after this. The manager was available, attentive and at least listened to my issue and resolved my taking off the gumbo. But Southerleigh all I needed you to do was just warm up the first cup. Throw it in a sauce pot or microwave and heat it up. I would have been a happy customer. I really wanted to experience the gumbo.  Drinks were superbly made. At least we did enjoy this and had wonderful toast to the night.   Overall there is a lot of things to try on this menu to come back but in my two visits the Luke warm food is one of the biggest opportunities."

Try a different side, hopefully it will live up to the reputation of the chicken.  Fishbowl cocktail was also a mistake. It was an intense amount of sugar. Struggled so hard to finish it. Honestly I would have left it there after a few sips, but I'm not a quitter. It would have been a better tasting drink if I had ordered it in a smaller size. Gluttony got me that afternoon.  The restaurant itself is very large.. Seems so small from the outside. Super clean. Friendly staff. They have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. TVs surrounded the bar, so no need to skip the sports games."

The Bad: the Chicken and Shrimp gumbo WASN'T...there were NO SHRIMP and we got Chicken skin...if they relabeled it Sausage and Okra Gumbo then you would have something!!! We had to request our Honey Biscuits that were included with our meals...we asked the manager if the Biscuits were made from scratch and he said they are, but they look and taste suspiciously like the were popped from a can.  We both had the 1/4 Chicken w/ Fries...the Chicken didn't standout good or bad...the fries...naw  The Ugly: We noticed the couple behind us get up and leave because they were seated and forgotten...afterwards a Server walked by their table and saluted the table to \"the Customers gone forever\"!!!  This isn't a bad place, but I didn't have pleasurable dining experience and nothing to compel me back...I hope they tighten up because they have potential...just too many stumbles for me...Good Luck!!!"

I must say my first impression of this place was impressive, but it kind of went south after that.  To get someone to initially greet us and even bring us water was well over 10 minutes, which kind of started me off on the wrong foot.    Lets start out with the fried biscuits.  Um...for all the Hype, I really didn't find them all that good.  They are super greasy and really not that flavorful.  I suppose I could have had a bad batch, but I sure won't order them again.    My friend ordered the chicken fried sandwich which he really didn't care for.  Again not a lot of flavor and kind of greasy.  I had the gumbo which I thought was pretty tasty, and would be worth having again.    The service did get better, but I'm leaving a 3 because of what I ordered at this visit.  I have had their shrimp at their other locations and long with their wings which are all home runs!"

The food was pretty good though my burger was juicy and had great flavor with the pimento beer cheese. The fried Mac and cheese balls had great flavor and a good crunch along with some pretty good dipping sauces. The Mac and cheese on the other hand was lacking something in flavor maybe the bread crumbs from the fried Mac and cheese balls. Not sure if we will go back but only time will tell."

The  apologetic hostess said there was a 30 to 40 minute wait for a table. I was a 'walk-in' and don't even know if they take reservations ; by the time I left,  lots of people were waiting in a small area.  So you Might want to come at an ' off time'   The bartenders were attentive and friendly and obviously enjoyed their what they were doing.     I had a reasonably priced cocktail, watched the game and My food arrived : I had the 1/4 fried chicken , macaroni and cheese side with that big delicious honey biscuit : talk about comfort food !  ( and Bill under $17) I used my napkin as a bib and unashamedly sucked those bones clean  I'm no connoisseur and admit I have eaten Churches fried;  but this was all soo very tasty.     No place is perfect these days with all the pandemic issues . Being a single female , I'm often   \" blown off\" so I appreciate their  good service.     If you've never Been to that area before: HAVE to  use the  public parking : was a short walk as I was lucky enough to find a spot there at the uncovered lot: drive down the R side of the restaurant across from the apartments.    afterwards I walked around  being so full : a Beautiful sitting area with lights!  Enjoyed my leftovers this AM for breakfast; Would like to return for brunch."

                "description": "So, I wasn't expecting to love their food so much, but I did. I do have to admit, we ordered everything fried, but it was all super flavorful and the portions were humongous.   Seating was easy on a weekend night,  but I expect this is due to the weather and the pandemic.   We started with drinks. I had the punch rouge. It was like a sangria with a dry wine. I liked it. I also tried the hurricane. Tasted just like I expected.   For my meal, I ordered the gulf coast seafood basket. It came with two sides. I chose the Mac and cheese and coleslaw. It was all perfect and just so much. I was able to take half home and enjoy it the next day. The breading on all the seafood was perfect. Tasty and crispy. I love hush puppies and theirs were super yummy. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy. That's not a bad thing. I did try one of their fried biscuits. They should really be called donuts. :-) It really made for a good dessert. They weren't super sweet, but they did have a hint of it.   I didn't try the chicken, but my table companions did and were impressed.   The only issue we had was the time it took for the food to come out. It seemed like forever.   Parking is available on site, but shared with the other businesses."

                "description": "@southerleighhautesouth is a must when looking for delicious food in a sleek, modern, casual setting in @therimsa area.   Southern comfort food is the cuisine, and it's done to perfection as the fried chicken is juicy and coated in a crunchy breading and the fresh tasting seafood (fish, shrimp, and oysters) is coated in a fantastic cornbread crust.   The mac n cheese and honey coated biscuits alone are worthy of a visit!"

The Makers Mark old fashioned was so good, I got up and complimented the Barman! The Mac n cheese was almost as good as my wife makes! Having Maddie taking care of us was  essential-ask for her! Enjoy some great Southern comfort food in a pleasant environment"

                "description": "I think it's hard to dislike any food tour, even if the food is OK, and not that special.  I think they have kind of a \"built-in\" advantage over other types of tours for that reason.   I'm speaking from experience as we've taken one now each place we travel to (if they have one) for the last 6 years, which is when it seems many good ones began to get started (US).  I noticed the reviews so far are all from people in San Antonio. Nothing wrong with that - I live here too.  However, none mention having taken other food tours they've taken so as to compare it.  When you do, I find this tour a bit pricey and not balanced. I know it's a about the food for the most part and was the main reason we took it despite the cost.  Yet, I was hoping for a true overall cultural experience like the best food tours we've done.  That way you walk away satisfied gastronomically but also feel like you'd received a real \"taste\" of the city's culture you're visiting while allow your palate to rest while \"digesting\" things other than food.  As I stated above, most food tours get good reviews, so I believe this is what helps separate the stand-outs from the average."

It is such a great idea for tourists that do not  have enough time to try all the hot spots or for locals that want to try something different. Our guide was knowledgable about the places we went and the ingredients used in our food. We had a food and beverage sampling at several popular restaurants. Every place we went had our table ready for us and hot food out within minutes. I am a vegetarian and each place had something for me. At the end of the evening  we were stuffed. The next day we made reservations to return to our favorite place on the tour (Bliss). If you are visiting San Antonio this tour should not be missed."

It is a divey place right on the Riverwalk north of downtown and the beer prices are cheap but it wasn't as funky or cool as I had hoped.  They were holding their Halloween party so some of the patrons were in costume which added to the \"atmosphere\".  The band had one of the worst sound systems I have ever heard - it makes those PA systems on subway systems sound clear.  Overall it is worth the trip out here but not sure it is the five star experience that many claim."

Well maybe they don't have the cheapest beer here as this is a little more of a tourist stop being right on the River Walk Museum Reach... but you do get a discount if you are a VFW member, which I am a Lifetimer thanks to my mother signing me up while she was actively involved with the original VFW at Canyon Lake in Satller.  Post 76 is open to the general public and they welcome everyone with a smile... just note, many VFWs are member only posts just to serve our Veterans of Foreign Wars. Please thank them for their service. Freedom is not Free! This post host several events during the year, including Fiesta San Antonio, so keep your eyes and ears open for something in the future. It does get crowed during events tho so just a warning They have a big band stand and beer garden outside along the river. It's really cool place to just hang out. I like it a whole lot better when it's a slow regular night.   VFW Post 76 is the oldest post in Texas, chartered June 26, 1917, by veterans of the Spanish American War. In 1946, They moved their post to this beautiful Victorian house located on the banks of the San Antonio River... and just in this past decade, the River Walk was expanded to what is now known as Museum Reach which makes this such an amazing location.   According to their website: \"There are rumors of two ghosts, which also adds to the houses mystic. Members attest to seeing a girl running up and down the stairs and an old man who likes to move furniture. They both share the name of \"Charley\".\"  This is a MUST DO when seeing Puro San Antonio!"

My husband and I are both lifetime members and self professed VFW experts. This-location is open to the public. We came by early on a Saturday afternoon with our kids. Drinks are SO cheap. They have karaoke and snacks but no food. Members were friendly which isn't always the case at lots of VFWs unfortunately. My husband is a seasoned combat Veteran from OIF and still has felt unwelcomed at several backwards locations which didn't seem to enjoy or welcome members under 50. I'm female so I rarely feel welcome at Veterans nonprofits. This one was different.  Texas seems to treat female Veterans pretty well. Seems to be cultural. We loved the history and canal view. The yard outside was packed with tourists. We were inside because Texas is HOT! I think they have fun events and concerts here. Too bad they didn't have food though. My kids will enjoy the big yard when weathers better. They have free concerts outside on the weekends."

It's huge and has a lot of great people that are regulars.  Yes, it is for veterans but it is open to the general public.  With that said, drink prices do vary for general public vs if you are active duty or a member.  Some days there are live music which is pretty cool because they perform outside.  Some days they have food for sale..  that may be tacos or something.  I can say, there have been plenty times we have been able to come and just hang out...  for hours... sit and laugh with friends, watch a game or come and dance.

The truth is veterans have lived a certain life that people outside the military simply don't understand. This is the perfect place for them to find the support and camaraderie they often need after they get out.  That being said, not being a veteran myself I love this place. It's often calm with good music on the jukebox, and friendly regulars and members. And did I mention the beer is CHEAP?  They often have events going on with live music, and they are right along a part of the Riverwalk.   If you haven't been here yet it is definitely worth checking out!"

                "description": "At this point there is no part of The River walk that hasn't been touched by expansion in some way. But as you walk closer toward the area near The Ten-Eleven or The Luxury you will see one particular spot, untouched by time. The VFW Post 76 is a historic place with a lore all its own. It is a place on any given night, especially on weekends where cold beers, jukebox music is blaring and people are having a good time.        It is an old building reminiscent of the one you will find in the King William area. Outside there are chairs and depending on the event the place is either packed or lightly inhabited. There is ample space on the grounds to walk with your drinks. It serves as a good intermediary between some fancy watering hole and an icehouse.       But mainly the VFW is known when it hosts certain events like the various food truck competitions and the numerous festivals it has here. Patrons that frequent this place can run the gamut from Pearl Brewery Apartment dwellers, bicyclists, hipsters, parents, lounge lizards, professionals, seniors looking for cheap Lone star beer etc. Whenever you go you are never sure what crowd to expect.       There is a very laid back vibe intermixed with a quirkiness to it. On one end of the floor you might see a couple straight out of an Urban Outfitters Catalog and just across the way you will see seniors sporting Lite beers, like it was some dance. At night the VFW takes on a romantic quality accompanied by the lights that guide The Riverwalk way.       In addition the servers and patrons alike are usually a friendly crowd. The beers are cheap and the Selena cover bands are even louder. Contrary to what people have said finding a parking spot can be hairy since The Luxury and The Ten Eleven people park in the same area as well. The later you go the less you are inclined to find a space. It's best to car pool with friends, especially when they have events like The Taco Truck Showdown. Either way there is fun to be had by all here.      The VFW Post 76 is a unique spot. It feels like a place untouched by time but relevant to any generation that goes here. The beers are cheap but it is rich in history and charm.    ps. If you are so inclined check out a video of a local band called, \"Pillow Talk ~ Slip of the Pen\" It was filmed at the VFW and captures the spirit of this place."

Called the \"White House\" the Victorian architecture is a shining example of what's being lost all along the San Antonio river as new buildings begin to become common.  As a veteran I'm proud of my fellow compatriots and here we can share stories and create new memories together.   Currently VFW #76 is going under some maintenance and construction to rehabilitate this old beauty.  Come down and enjoy a few pints and meet the San Antonio veterans."

There are lots of seating outside and everyone was friendly. It looked pretty full the day we visited but after asking a few tables for available seats, we found our spot. The beer is cold, music is upbeat and everyone rocks late into the night. Great place to unwind after work with friends. I'll visit again soon!!"

                "description": "VFW post 76 in San Antonio Texas is the oldest functioning post in our state. It's equally great regardless of if you are a veteran or not. All are welcome.  In the hustle and bustle of the Riverwalk it's a great place to stop in, relax, have a cold beverage and enjoy the conversation with any veterans that you are lucky enough to encounter. My husband happens to be a veteran and served in Vietnam. I find that it's very good for him to be around other veterans when we have the opportunity. He doesn't ever share stories about his time overseas. Sadly, it was not only unpopular because of the military aspects of war, but many in our great nation were downright disrespectful to the men and women who served there. Sometimes as they were returning home or being dispatched, drafted or not..... Anyway- This VFW post is in a very well-kept older home and reminds me of a plantation style residence. All beverages are icy cold, and it's a beautiful environment. You can sit and watch barges go by on the river and during the holidays the river is lit with thousands of lights and barges full of caroling children! They also frequently have live music.  It's definitely worth a stop."

                "description": "After a morning of fall festivities at the pumpkin patch and corn maze, kiddo and I were looking for something to fill our tummies - so, while we didn't eat there, we did finally grab some Dog Haus to try at home, and the establishment is so funky and pleasant, we definitely want to come back and done in eventually.  I was planning on reviewing four stars and holding off on a rave review until we actually ate inside, but I have to bump up to five right off the bat because my little dude, who can be notoriously picky and outright refuse to eat if someplace is unfamiliar, inhaled his food from here and dipped into mine. And he ate the grilled onions on our food - I don't know if you realize how hard it is to get any vegetable into my four-year-old's mouth without a war breaking out.   We started with the corn dog sliders, and we knew we were in for a good experience because the batter was great and had a perfect crunch to the outside, and was just thick enough. And the actual dog itself? EXCELLENT. Back in California, there was a giant corn dog at a market/fair I used to attend that I loved with a passion, and this made me think of that. In and of itself, the dog really shines in the corn dog.  Moving on the to actual hot dog with toppings, the Cowboy - I have to say I barely got a nibble in of this one, because my son loved it and made sure our plans of splitting everything and making sure he, myself, and grandma got an equal taste of everything went out the window. I sometimes get nervous when I hear \"bacon-wrapped\" about a hot dog because I worry it will be a thick, gross, undercooked bandage of bacon around a hot dog. Not the case here! No squishy bacon here! Great texture especially with the crispy onions and my son was a huge fan of the cheese sauce.  And the Holy Aioli burger on the Hawaiian rolls? Those rolls are a staple in our house and these were nicely toasted through with a great crunch to them that kept the bread from getting soggy. I wish the meat patty were a little meatier but the toppings were so delicious, I can forgive anything. They could've forgotten the meat and served me a sandwich with just the toppings and I would have no qualms paying full price for that, it was so good.  Overall, I am really happy with this place and can't wait until kiddo and I finally make time to eat there! So good!"

The dogs are great. They have many creative options so don't be shy and order a couple. I love their hot chick sandwich. I wish they gave you heat options because sometimes the sandwich is perfect in heat but sometimes it lacks heat. The burgers are good but they aren't thick n juicy yet more smashed and thin. I always go with the chicken and side it with a dog I haven't tried yet.  Add the fries! All options are great. The beer is where it's at! They have so many options and always in stock! Full liquor bar too so stay late. I wish they were open 24/7. Lol. Enjoy!"

Our fries tasted at first of old oil, but found the employees more than willing to completely replace them with fresh ones that tasted good. We tried 1 corn dog, and 3 hot dogs in our group. We find all but one to be pretty lackluster, and lukewarm. I suppose to sum up, it was good but we wouldn't be back. For management, please note, the customer service here is excellent! Saw another customer give the cashier some lip, not her fault at all you all were busy."

This is a cool spot with plenty of TVs to watch sports, a ton of cold beer, and good food, too!   I tried the Big Kahuna Burger which seems to be a limited time offering, but I am  hoping they keep it on the menu.   Served on Hawaiian rolls with onion rings, bacon, peppers, cheese, and sauces, this is a tasty burger! The flavors and textures combine very nicely.   They have fries, tots, and (my favorite) sweet potato fries to accompany the burgers and hot dogs.   A sports bar atmosphere yet very clean and well lit located at 281 and Stone Oak is just what the area needs.   I'll definitely be back.   Check it out and then hit me up on Instagram and let me know what you thought! @CheatDay_SA"

They have an ample beer selection and great cocktails to try. The food is good, I don't think I can complain about it. However if you're expecting to be blown away, you will leave disappointed. They are hotdogs with cool toppings. I do think that the toppings get in the way of the quality of the meat and bread. I almost regret getting what I got because the sauces and toppings get in the way of the true quality ingredients. Next time I will try a more classic and basic hotdog."

I was disappointed that they couldn't do a wurst corn dog using Beyond brat. I was also disappointed that they didn't have the impossible sliders.  So, we ended up trying a regular mini corn dog, The old town dog, The beyond brat, chili cheese fries, onion rings, and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was lacking flavor. Of course, you can't mess up fries or onion rings. Those were good. The beyond brat was smaller than expected, but had good flavor. The old town dog was a lot of bread and a little bit of dog.   For drinks, we had a lady in red and the blind melon. The lady in red reminded me of a sangria. The blind melon was sweet.   You order first and then sit down. Someone brings out your food and drinks.  They have inside and outside seating. The outside seating is under a covered patio. They also have a good list of beers. There's a small area where you can play corn hole. Parking is available on site and plentiful."

The menu linked to Yelp is not the same menu at this location. I was surprised to find this is a franchised establishment. Several items were the same, but some items were not offered at this location. I've included a picture of this location's food menu.  There was a \"special dog\" poster at the register, a bahn mi type, which will be offered for a limited time. We ordered the Old Town, chili dog, a side order of mini corn dog, and a side of onion rings.  The buns are King Hawaiian mini slider buns. They leave 3 together, slice in the middle, and fill. Made it very convenient to cut into thirds and share.   The beer part of this Biergarten is well stocked. Looked close to as many as the monk's....well, maybe not as many, but darn well had a large selection to choose from. We ordered the Save the World 2 offerings- AngusDei and Fructus Bonam.  I preferred the AD to be paired with the food.   They have a nice pub type menu with a variety of foods and beers. Nice to have a great new eatery so close to home!"

They nailed the vehicleÂ with a pillowy soft and subtlyÂ sweet hawaiianÂ bun.  They crushed the topping combos with all the sauces, slaws, and savory delights imaginable.  But...  The dang dogs just ain't worthy. The little meat tubes failed to assert themselves. Size queens beware: Sausages and Hotdogs alike were shamefully small in both the length and girth department. For likeÂ $6 each, this could haveÂ been forgiven, however the meat pipe's own flavors were barely perceptible.Â Even the sausage, which I personally expect to be much more robust, registered almost no spice and its texture was on par with theÂ hot dog, a huge let-down.  For those undeterredÂ by the aforementioned weiner problems:  Don't be shocked when you arrive, it looks just like a Taco Bell,Â but indeed, it is not.  When you enter, you will be confronted with a monochromatic Taco Bell-style counter. It will have the teenager, the dense menu on the wall behind him, and when he takes your order (again like theÂ Bell) don't expect enthusiasm, I didn't get any.Â   The dining area was comfortable and ultra clean. There was a full bar (which, had I gone there first and chugged a few, would have improved my experience dramatically).Â   Would I return?Â   Maybe, but not unless I was already under the influence."

After World of Beer and Brewers grill closed the only option was to head down to Hoppy Monk but finally we have a great new option here locally. No fuss, no frills and just great food!!  I don't typically hunt down a hot dog place as I am vegetarian but they have two REALLY GOOD plant based - Beyond Meat - hot dogs !! So, so good !  The onion rings are also awesome, the Tots ( cheese covered - why the heck not ) . The meat eaters in our party enjoyed the  Old Town because bacon apparently makes everything better and the Downtown!   Great beer selection - enjoyed the Electric Jellyfish IPA . They also have cocktails and milkshakes for the kids.   Great outside patio, cool inside space and fast service ! Perfect way to enter the weekend! Loved it"

                "description": "My wife and I have been frequent guests at Jazz TX since it opened, and the experience has always been outstanding!  From the speak easy vibe of going under the Food Hall to find the club through a small door and behind the curtains, through to the music, the drinks and now an outstanding food menu.  Jazz TX doesn't disappoint. The decor, the lighting, the backdrop and the intimacy of the low stage right in front of you - it is everything I wanted for jazz. We always enjoy relaxing with music from Doc Watkins and his band.  There is a never ending parade of quality jazz artists and ensembles that come through to perform, so check the calendar and make a reservation!  My only request is a little more room between the tables - add a foot in each direction around the table for servers, patrons walking and comfort, and maybe some padded chairs?  I can't complain - its jazz music at its very best in a setting that is every bit a cool jazz bar.  Thank you Doc Watkins for a great place!!"

I can't recall the martini i ordered but it has a great light pear taste that wasn't overly sweet. Doc Watkins band is brilliant. Christmas show sold out within 20 minutes of tickets release but I believe any show would be just as beautiful to see."

                "description": "In this review I will cover the GOOD, THE BAD, and THE UGLY.  For my wife's birthday, I took my family (6 adults) to the show and had dinner/drinks where I spent around $500 for the show and dinner.  THE GOOD- location, food, the band, service       Located in San Antonio's  Pearl District, with free parking.  Jazz TX is located in the basement under the Pearl's Food Court.  It was a cozy little venue that holds about 60 people.  All tables had great views of the band's stage.       No complaints on the TASTE of the food.       The singer, \"Doc\"  and his band were very entertaining.  Doc kept the audience laughing in between songs. They put on a great show.       The service-  a constant flow of people ensuring your every needs are met.  This was great but also added to THE BAD below.  THE BAD - I guess I was expecting a Dinner and a show.  The kind of place you pay for an over priced meal for a free show.  At Jazz TX you pay to watch the show and also pay for over priced dinner options.       Food Menu - Very limited menu.  They have four large dinner items.  If the large plates are the \"large\" portions, the \"small\"  must be tiny!  I remind you their food was tasty!       Music - Having visited Jazz venues in New Orleans my family's expectations were a little different.  The music at Jazz TX was more \"early Jazz,\" like the \"Big Band Music\" genre.  Not exactly what we wanted but we're willing to take in the show.  Thanks to Doc and the Band we were entertained.  THE UGLY - lack of management!  There was a patron who entered drunk, was constantly criticizing the singer and the band throughout the entire show.  He was so loud that people from three rows of tables away turned their heads.  This drunk even faced time somebody, holding his phone up over his head and yelled in order to communicate with the person he called.  I could not believe the employees totally ignored him.  This was quiet annoying and ruined a good night.  With all the servers constantly walking through the very small venue, why would they not do or say something?  So for the lack of management, and limited menu I give the venue an average score of three.  If you want to spend money and allow the management have drunks run the place, then I highly recommend Jazz TX.  Maybe in between the yelling you might be able to enjoy the show you paid to watch."

                "description": "Date night!!! Was so excited to take my GF out.  She loves their old fashion.  Food and drinks were great.  Except, I had to eat my tacos cold.    Faviola was our server.  She gave us time to look at the menu.  We ordered pasta, Bruschetta, shrimp tacos to start off. Later we ordered chips and queso, pecan pie and coffee.  Not to mention her three old fashions and my jack and coke.  Bruschetta came out (3 pieces of bread with shrimp).  Delicious!!!  Then my tacos came out and we waited for the pasta. And waited. And waited.  My tacos got cold as we waited for her pasta.  Finally Faviola comes around, we asked about the pasta and she said she didn't hear the order.  PAUSE: no apology or let me make this right, just I'll go place the order.  So now my tacos get colder waiting for the pasta.  Common sense  as a server is to ask to remake the other dish.    Just need to tighten up that customer service.  I even told my GF that it looked like she stereotyped us before  she came to the table.  Other than that the band was great, food tasted good minus the cold tacos. 3 stars for the food and band."

Friday night is a great time to come out and enjoy the music especially since they do get crowd interaction.   The food: a few different options to wet any palette but still bar food just a little bit more fancy and overpriced. We ordered the burger and shrimp dish which came out hot and picture worthy.   The burger tasted so good and was cooked to perfection. It was bursting with flavor and the onion jam really did set it off and I don't like onions.   The shrimp dish was very good also. Nothing too complicated or special but tasted really  Save your coin and dine somewhere else and then come and enjoy the music. The food is overpriced and you can enjoy great food somewhere else first. Plus the service was not very good at all. Our server was inattentive and only came back for the check."

                "description": "I've noticed every year more and more events are being planned specifically around, \"Dia De Los Muertos.\" There are food, drink and now the city's first river parade to celebrate it. So why not an event named after a local craft beer? Well the Freetail Brewing Co. has been doing one for a decade named after you guessed it, a seasonal beer. It's called \"La Muerta\", a much sought after stout in the craft beer circle.  I have been wanting to do this event for years but like Pat Benatar says, \"Life's what happens when you make other plans.\" Needless to say I bought general admission tickets for $30 bucks and some change. The price includes a sample glass, eight tickets for 8 small pours and a bottle of \"La Muerta.\" Initially when I came I was anticipating a full house. Instead the crowd was at a manageable level, you could freely maneuver through. In keeping with the theme there were artisan's booths, mariachis and people dressed in elaborate costumes.  In the main area where the brewing tanks are stationed a sample pouring table is set up. They had different variants of \"La Muerta\" alongside beers pulled from their cellar. Looking at the sample glass and the size of the pours one assumes if the price merits what's served. However the samples are deceptively strong and sneak up on you. By my fifth pour I was feeling as limber as a ghost. My only critique is in the seating arrangements. There were little to no available tables once it was in full swing. Even the usage of communal  benches limits the spacing of this event. Next year they need to increase possible seating or allow you to bring your own chairs.  In addition whole pours were not being sold if you enjoyed a specific variant. I thought this was kinda lame but not a dealbreaker. I know that a limited supply of barrels are created for the festival. I hope next year they will reconsider allowing you to buy limited snifter sized pours. Having said all these things this festival is still unique. The crowd are all stout- hounds who want to taste a beer that is here from a short time, then is gone. It almost seems like a metaphor for life. Ok I'll stop my Waldo Emerson stylings, at least for now.  If you wanna try something different and you love local craft beer like myself go seek this event. It happens only once a year. Don't forget to leave a drink for your loved ones. Hopefully one day someone will return the sentiment back."

                "description": "When you hear the word BUS one would normally think about a city bus or there like. This is not the case for the Crafty Thirst Beer Bus, no it's a VW van that is being used to serve beer. We were passing by and noticed a sign that said Grand Opening. We stopped to check out this Grand Opening. We were approached by this creepy guy smoking a cigarette as he said do you have ID, we showed our drivers licenses and instead of saying thank you, have a nice day anything he just stared at us. We were reading the list of beers that were offered. It was a little confusing as there was no direction on what the beers were are how much they were. We decided to order at the VW \"BUS\". We were asking what different types of beers were available and how much they were. The guy that was helping us (later found out was the one of the owners) passed us to someone else. We thought that was rude but the lady that served us made up for it. The beers were $7.00 dollars for a 9 ounce or you could get 4 -  7 ounces for $10.00 dollars to me that is extremely high. Most of the places in Canyon Lake have beers for $2.50. The beer we had, had more of a foam head on it and we were not offered to top it off. Another guy was serving mixed drinks one with Pecan Rum. The mixed drinks were $7.00 dollars, high for the area and the amount you get. I will confess that the rum was one of the best I have had. A few times I heard other people saying that the price's were too high. If you can get a beer for $2.50 then why would someone pay $7.00 dollars. The band was the only entertainment and they were amazing. There was suppose to be a raffle for the VW BUS but when I asked about it I was told that it was not going to take place. This was troubling being that I was told by the owner that it was the main giveaway."

ICONIC. kristi waters, kendoll, mehgan dlux, natasha capri, i would die for any of them. honestly  it was my favorite drag brunch of all time. i told kendoll i would die for her and that i'm in love with her and she said it back and gave me a peck. and on the subject of her, my god y'all she's SO GORGEOUS and her outfits... they make me drool. i need her closet. after the show, i was going to the restroom and ran into kendoll and mehgan at the elevator. we actually had an emotional conversation and i absolutely adore them.  i also went to a peep show here and they had an aerial dancer, dessany, and she is beyond beautiful and incredibly talented. so sweet, too! i spoke with her after the show and took a picture with her, and then spoke with kristi waters, also very kind, and got a picture with her as well.  the queens and other performers here are so lively and fun, the drinks are good, the atmosphere is amazing. the whole place is \"instagram worthy\" lol. they make you feel included and they're very interactive. hands down my favorite spot in sa and i recommend it to everyone!"

The drinks were super strong and everyone looked to be having a swell time.   The ambiance is really \"instagrammable\" and I love how all the decorative pillows are mismatched. Be sure to check out the bathroom and the champagne vending machine!!!"

                "description": "Bought tickets for Sunday drag brunch. Got an email that said seating started at 10 when really it started at 11 - conflicting reservation / event messages. Got there and the seating process was extremely disjointed. Since we were early as a party, we expected good seating as it is \"first come first serve\" and they tried to sit our group of 6 on a bench along the wall without any tables. We had to ask to be seated at a table where our group could actually see one another and hang out.   Once we got settled, it was obvious the drinks were ridiculously overpriced. $14 for a mimosa. And they don't have coffee for brunch? Kinda wild. On top of that the menu was extremely limited and for a place that claims they want to emulate luxury and have a dress code, they really don't serve nice food. The avocado toast is basically packaged guac on plain un toasted bread.   The area is nice on the rooftop but honestly not really conducive to a drag show. Depending on where you get sat, you may only see half of the performance.   The queens were great, only good part about the drag brunch."

                "description": "The drag show is amazing! The entertainment is top notch for south Texas and you'll love Kristi Waters! Make sure to arrive early if you're planning on attending the drag brunch so you can sit inside under the industrial size fans otherwise you'll get to experience Texas hell size heat outside.  Bring your friends for an amazing time with the drag show.  Make sure to pre-eat and pre-drink because the food is by far the worst brunch food in SA (sorry not sorry) and the drinks were overpriced and ehhh (unimpressive).  I would have rated a 3 star but for the amazing time we had because of the AMAZING DRAG SHOW!   Come with a group and get there early!"

The drinks were just as beautiful and the cocktail servers were so friendly and fun to talk to! This place has a lot of photo ops so be super to snap some cute pics. I've heard a lot of hype about their drag brunch so will definitely be coming back soon."

                "description": "This was such a weird experience. I showed up and there's someone outside checking ID's. Then, you go to the bar on the 4th floor and you have to take the stairs all the way up. I was waiting for the dude to say he was kidding. But no... 3 flights of stairs. I got up and then the menu drinks were all about $20 each. The outside chairs were so uncomfortable. They also sit parties together. You and your friends could be sitting on a couch in a circle with chairs and if the chairs are open, a random party will join you. It was just ... strange.  I get the vibes they were trying to give off. The place was semi-cute. But the over priced drinks were killer to me. Upscale restaurants don't even charge that much. I recommend this as a place to stop for one drink during your nightly adventure. Not to stay all night."

You have to climb 4 flights of stairs! She made it to the top but couldn't breathe for a bit :( :(     2) under the FAQ section, it clearly says that there is a 15% service charge included in all prices... so \"tipping isn't necessary but welcomed\"..... okay so that justifies the $18 price tag on drinks... WRONG!! When I settled my tab, the waitress asked for a tip?!?! Saying prices don't include tip?!?! Are you kidding me?? 3) not real brunch. There is only like 5 food items :( so get tipsy and walk down 4 flights of stairs!!!   I wish it was better!"

                "description": "Let me start by saying, I've been to many Drag Shows and enjoyed them all....BUT!!!!! this place was the worse experience I've had this far. And friend and I went to their BDSM show the Nighy before Halloween expecting to have a great time..NO MA'AM!. I purchased VIP tickets to the show expecting to have a memorable night only to be denied a seat in the main area. We got there, and was told there were no seat available and were offered 2 lawn type chairs and a wooden bench for a table to sit at, outside. After inquiring about the seating that was open ( mind you, this place is a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE SEATING place), those seat were reserved for larger parties. Of this place is first come first serve we should get the semi-comfortable couches in the building. No, they told us we couldn't sit in these areas. After having a somewhat heated conversation with a so-called manager our night was ruined. Upon asking about a refund since there was no \"seating\" available, we were told we could not get a refund but had to reschedule our visit. He were told we could not pick the night we wanted to reschedule for. WTF is that?!?!?  We asked to sit in a certain area and was told it was I safety hazard. Not 2 seconds later someone was seated exactly where we asked to sit. PLEASE DO BETTER PARAMOUR.  Those of us willing to spend our money should be treated better. Moreover, don't over book your shows and force your customers in uncomfortable positions. I will NOT be back despite the fact that I'm a Kristie Water's fan.. Please step up! To you potential customers, find another place to spend your  funds! Furthermore, spending hours to get into your best  threads to walk up 4 flights of stairs, outside,  just to sweat out your clothes, hair, makeup, lashes, brows hope and dreams to pay $18 for a watered down drink is just enough to wonder...Why Try?!?!????? Please do better."

Aside from the beer, the drinks are somewhat expensive, but I guess you're also paying for the view and the atmosphere. The waiters are very attentive, and the place is just as beautiful on the outside patio as it is in the inside bar/lounge area. We had some of their cocktails as well as beer, and all of it was great. This is definitely a cool place to go and splurge a bit for a date night, or a night out with friends!"

Did I mention there is a champagne vending machine?! They also have very neat neon signs everywhere- super photo worthy if you're into that stuff. Drinks were good too. We went 9/1/21 and the bartender said they had just rolled out a new menu that day. The staff was very friendly!

This rude waiter came turned the umbrella I said excuse me. He yelled you need to share don't be rude. Remind you he gave us no warning before turning the umbrella. After watching him serve drinks to everyone around us the group next to us would order water and give it to us. After one hour we left f the show this place sucks and he should be fired.

The staff members were very accommodating to members in the party with disabilities (very appreciative of that). I attended Paramour in the evening for a social event and for the drag show brunch event, which was great to see the change in ambience. The music, furniture, drinks, and staff set a relaxing atmosphere during the evening and exuberance during the drag show. They also have great customer service, so I will definitely return to Paramour in the future. Keep up the great work Paramour staff! :)"

                "description": "We went for the Drag brunch. On a Sunday. My friends ordered the Barbacoa tacos. They came out extremely cold everybody's order. A friend of mine ordered the avocado toast and the Chilaquiles. The Chilaquiles is basically HEB corn tortilla chips with an egg on top and some mediocre Ranchero sauce. Not worth as much money as it is on the menu. Also was very cold. Avocado toast wasn't even toasted and see photos. Secondly the performers parking situation is unreal they blocked us in they said it was their parking lot there's no sign that says it's there parking lot there could've been an extreme emergency and no one could get out. And lastly me at the elevator does not work so you have to climb up 5 to 6 flights of stairs just to get to the rooftop. Don't drink too much that could seriously be a traumatic situation quickly. This is supposed to be one of San Antonio's upscale places and I'm just not seeing it here and I'm not afraid to speak the truth. Beautiful atmosphere but need some work."

They have changed there business model to cater to a younger and more 'alternative' lifestyle clientele. I have no problem with that except that either since I'm just an old straight guy no one concerns themselves if I want anything or they just don't give a damn if anyone wants anything. We were the only people there so not sure what their lack of service was all about. More concerned about the late night drag and stripper crowd coming later. I would have thought my money was just as good. Female bartenders were friendly enough as long as I went to the bar. Some little dude who wanted to impress I guess was super rude to my wife. Was not a regular obviously but will never go back again."

Paramour has a prime location on the Riverwalk and after enduring 7 flights of stairs you will be rewarded with a fun, vibrant, and playful atmosphere. Five out of five stars for the atmosphere both interior and exterior. Absolutely stunning.   Taking off stars for the cocktails -- service, taste, timeliness. We were the only people there ordering at 2p on a Friday (there was another couple talking to a manager) and it took 15 minutes to get acknowledged by the other bartender. She then gave attitude when we asked about the menu and her recommendations but eventually we ordered and proceeded to wait for another 20 min to get our drinks. I understand they are specialty but this was extreme. When we finally got the drinks, I can't say they were worth the wait nor the price tag.  I also was a little disappointed in the bathroom area where you wash your hands. Not clean, soap was everywhere, there was melted wax in the sink, and lack of paper towels but the bathroom stalls were clean.   I recommend checking this place out but maybe go with a beer to speed up the process and enjoy the outdoor patio."

The food mediocre at best, is made up of quite a bit of prepackaged foods (the first time we went there Little Debbie cosmic brownies taken out of packaging and put on a plate), and costs $25. This last time we went the food was definitely better than the first time.   But cocktails are OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced. Simple cocktails that you'd normally pay $7-10 for elsewhere are $18. Sangria is $16. It is sort of unbelievable.   All that said, the drag show is worth it all. So organized with an amazing, talented, and witty host. She always has the best talent performing.

We had to be seated outside and didn't see the show. Our waitress, Kendra was amazing but she was tending to too many tables. Drinks way overpriced. Don't waste your time and money here. Too bad. It is a great idea in a great location, but executed very poorly."

The new owners put a bar, front patio and added some flare.  Love the plates on the ceiling and the choices of draft beer.  Last time we went, it was after Paintballing for a friend's 13 year old son.  So glad to stop in for a cold beer to help the aches and pain of shooting some teenagers!  Amanda was the bartender that day and was great.  She was friendly and talked with us at the bar.  She works weenends and I will be back for her smile.    This is a great bar near us and place every San Antonioian should try at least once."

I already felt safer because it's more of an outdoor setting and the tables are plenty spaced out. They also have heaters for the colder nights. The hookah worker they had was beyond nice and helpful. Their bartenders were super friendly going around asking if we needed anything so that we didn't need to go up to the bar. The food truck they have is delicious, I tried their Texas size cheese sticks and they were delicious! DJ had a great mix of music going. Overall the whole night was very enjoyable."

Tonight was my first day back to this bar since corona and it was really suffering from slow service but it was fine. I must admit the place was full but the bad thing was that an individual physical shoved me out of the bar order area because he wanted to order. I bucked back at him told him I was ordering and if he could just wait until I payed he claimed that that was his bar and next thing u know the bouncers kicked me out. All while he kept claiming and screaming this is my bar. I was respectful and calm while he was aggressive and loud yet I got kicked out. If it was the owner oh well, nice bar I used to love it but I will never be back happy 4th but this vet will find another place."

I'm presuming that your experience will be based on how packed it is and who is in charge that night. If it's really packed, I don't recommend going. However, if it looks like you can make a straight shot to the bar or restrooms, definitely plan on staying for a few hours. The DJ plays music that makes you want to get up and move. That's pretty much all I have to say."

When we got to the front we paid $5 each for cover and was escorted to the back outdoor area where we were told to wait for our bartender to come to us... we waited another 50 minutes and no one showed up. So eventually we got tired of waiting to be served and left to find our car broken into. I know that break-in's is not necessarily something that a business can control but I parked in their parking lot where they apparently have security and it still happened. As businesses have to adjust to the new operating expectations, many companies have changed their procedures of service. But in this case we had zero service. One of the guys that cleans tables told us to wait for our bartender after we had already been waiting there for 20 minutes. That's why we kept waiting as long as we did. As long as they continue to operate this way, it's honestly not worth going."

Mostly college students and 20 something year olds, but a chill relaxed atmosphere nonetheless.   Live music is on rotation, and the DJ keeps the mood energized with a good mix of 90s to Top 40 music.   Continued improvements to the plac e as a whole keep it a fun and lively environment. New signage makes great photo ops!   \"Giant\" beer pong played with trash cans and volleyballs is really fun, especially when you've taken advantage of the drink specials a couple times haha  The prices are fairly inexpensive even when not on HH, which adds to the appeal. So Please drink responsibly!"

Surprisingly all we did was socialize and hardly drank but it was still a great time, just goes to show that you dont always need booze to have fun. The gorgeous and awesome Barkeep Jordan was very nice and had great customer service skills, her and her mini-hers were working hard and looking good. Jordan made sure everyone at the bar was being tended to. They also have a BBQ Truck in the parking lot!!"

I ordered a double vodka drink, and was charge 1.25 per shot which was 2.50 total for one drink on top of the price of the actual drink. No other bar is doing this. Just raise your prices and be honest- and I would be more than willing to pay more since I know bars have struggled from covid.

Although I was not too close to the bar, a server noticed what happened and since my glass was mostly full, she kindly replaced it. What great service!   I always enjoy going to I-10 Icehouse and the great drink specials throughout the week. I haven't had food there but the wings always smell delicious. I also enjoy that they have many activities people can be entertained with such as ping pong, darts, billiards, giant connect four, a basketball game, a big screen projector. Good job, y'all! This is what keeps me coming back!"

                "description": "The staff is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because everyone who helped me and my party were so nice. The parking area is small and there was a big dip in the spot so I almost stepped in a puddle of water while getting out. It's a moderately clean place with plenty of seating and like I said, a lot of friendly staff. The food is so sub par. I ordered the sample platter of appetizers and it was really meh. Just grease and little actual flavor, yes I understand it's basic bar fare, but the fried mushrooms were not good. I'm not sure they even cleaned them first. Chips and salsa were fine and the cheese quesadilla was actually ok. I had some beer then switched to water which I drank until I realized (as I was leaving) that the glass wasn't all that clean. Bleh!"

They offer different drink specials everyday of the week some are actually really good such as 1.75 beers. Parking is easy during the week but weekends it gets very crowded. They show most MMA matches or boxing matches but they charge covers for those nights.   Service isn't that good here or the food but we usually just come to hang out and drink.  The inside is a little drab but very spacious and plenty of seating."

Every experience I've had with her has been so nice, especially after a long day at work.   Today, Vino, the food manager really made my day. I once had a bad experience with the food and never really wanted to risk ordering food again until today. I just so happened to ask Jen if the cook was in a good mood because of said bad experience and it just so happened that Vino over heard. He made sure my Cheese Burger was hot and exactly how I wanted it. It was SO good. It was also nice how considerate and humble he was. I couldn't have had a better service after a really tiring day. I will be back for my Burger and Micheladas soon!!"

We stopped in for an afternoon glass of wine and they did not disappoint.  The menu is pretty extensive with light snacks, charcuterie boards you can mix and match and flatbreads. I would say you will get totally full eating here if you're super hungry but it's a nice spot for brunch, light afternoon meal until dinner.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the wine flight where they pick wines based on you're taste. The waiter did a superb job picking 3 delicious choices for us! Well done.  We picked 4 on the charcuterie board and I added smoked salmon which was an up charge. We will come back as this was a great day date out."

                "description": "Part of the Pearl's charm, are the many great restaurants, coffee places and wine and beer businesses located in it. High Street Wine is one of these locales.   High Street is located on the street section of the Pearl. I came after dinner to meet some friends and loved this wine bar's huge wine selection. I ordered a glass of Garnet, which was very good. Their wine by the glass ranges from $11 upward, so it's definitely not cheap. Bottles can also be purchased and they had some good wine flights.   High Street is ideal as an after dinner hangout, or for a pre-dinner drink/ snack. I did not get to sample the snacks, but I intend to when I return.   I really loved the feel of this place and atmosphere. It's an advantage that it is located at the Pearl, which tends to be very active during summer evenings, especially Saturdays. I've already added High Street to the list of places to which I will return."

Just a great selection of wine including some unique finds and all very well priced. Comprehensive beer selection with a wide variety of great ( aka Untappd highly rated ) finds and great food  This time we tried two of their flatbreads which are a newer addition to the menu, their cheese and charcuterie plate , olives and nuts as well as as their champagne , IPAs and a wine flight !   We ended up leaving with a Portuguese bottle of red which as for hard Napa reds is new to us but was a great choice after trying on the wine flight !  Great service , cool vibe and one of my fave spots in SA"

Small eats like charcuterie boards are available as well. Staff members are very friendly and knowledgeable. We had amazing service from Matt on the day we went.  Love how the atmosphere is relaxing and away from the crowds of the yard and market areas. This is one of the very few places at the Pearl that has an  unpretentious vibe. Will definitely be back next time we're in the area!"

                "description": "Last week I visited High Street Wine Co. for the first time since the pandemic started and I had a fabulous experience!  High Street Wine has always been a more intimate wine bar, with only a limited number of sitting space. Due to the pandemic, they've moved most of their tables outdoors which I think is amazing, because their outdoor space is so beautiful and at night you can enjoy the new holiday lights. Another great thing about High Street is that they are located away from the madness of The Pearl's main yard, which made me feel more comfortable and safe. All of their tables have a QR code at the center which you can scan to view their wine and food menu. If you have any issues scanning the code, you can also find the menu on their website. Frankly, I was a little overwhelmed by their menu and decided to just ask our server for his recommendation. He asked us what kind of wine we were looking for and a price range, and his recommendation was on point! Never be afraid of asking for suggestions. The people working here are experts and they will be able to tell you everything you need to know about their selection.   Thank you High Street Wine Co. for a wonderful evening!"

The charcuterie board had a variety of meats and cheeses, along with honey, a fig jam, and a great spicy mustard for accompaniments.  The flatbreads might have been a bit crispier but they had great flavor l.  I will definitely be back!"

I loved the atmosphere and decor, especially with the Christmas lights and fires shining outside.   My date and I split a cheese board with the tam (the rind was quite earthy!), blue, and chÃ¨vre and it was amazing. Really beautiful. The mustard was delicious! So were the jam and honey. I personally love cornichons and enjoyed all of them myself. It was 3 for $15 and came with bread. We wished we would have tried the duck breast - next time! With different cheeses.   Date had an enjoyable glass of Chinon ($10) and an employee recommended a Beaujolais Nouveau to me, a Pinot Noir lover. It was surprisingly $7 a glass and I enjoyed it.   The selection is extensive as you can imagine.  I really love this gorgeous spot and can see it as the perfect spot for almost any occasion, day or night. We will be back soon for a Saturday tasting with friends!"

I also ordered the 'Rose all day' flight, while my friend ordered the 'it's all about me' flight. She mostly got red wines, which she allowed me to sample.

Of course like a nice wine bar they let you sample before you commit.   One thing I'll say, not as a criticism, but just so people are aware, the charcuterie boards have very small portions.   The only other thing is that a larger selection of wine by the glass would be nice, but it's by no means a small selection."

We walked over after dinner at Supper at Hotel Emma where a few in our group had a few glasses of wine. We had a DD and also a pregnant woman in our group. After sitting down the waiter, Kevin, checked our IDs and then left the table without asking for our order or providing any insight on the wine offerings for the table. Instead, we were awkwardly approached again and were told that we had clearly been drinking before and they did not feel comfortable serving us any bottles of wine. No one in our group was acting belligerent or inappropriately. It was incredibly rude. We brought this to the attention of the staff on our way out and were told that they felt it was the appropriate call due to two people in our group stumbling - one of which was 8 months pregnant and had ordered a non-alcoholic beverage. A complete lie.   It is a shame that a poor judgement call was made before we were even able to give this place a chance. I have never received such terrible service.   The waiter, Kevin, needs to be taught on how to read customers and approach them in the appropriate manner if there is a serious concern for excessive alcohol consumption."

                "description": "Walked into the Gristmill about 7:55 P.M. on New Year's Eve 2021, not really expecting to be seated.  Surprisingly, the hostesses were very accommodating, and promised us the outside seating we requested \"in about 20 minutes\".  We were seated in five. Our server, Morgan, a lovely  young woman, a college student at a Texas University,  was impeccable in carrying out her duties, she gave us much better service one might expect on such a busy night as this was.  Everything was perfect, from the seating, to the food - onion rings, tortilla soup, the bronze catfish and the baby back ribs were all excellent. It was an amazingly wonderful experience made so by a diligent and attentive wait staff. Totally recommend the Gristmill River Restaurant"

They are currently redoing the back so all of the seating was inside.. they had a nice warm fire going.. great views of the river inside.  It did get pretty toasty inside thankfully one of the waitresses came over and opened up the windows..   I ordered the steak salad and my friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich..  The steak salad was good, there was a handful of the lettuce that should have been tossed out not tossed into the salad which is why this isn't 5 stars.. The steak was good super tender!  We both loved the chicken salad sandwich.. it's not sweet which made it different and even more delicious!  I almost forgot the onion rings! I would absolutely order those again! Only able to eat one so I'd order the small but sooo good and not very oily at all!"

Ours appetizer finally arrived and then our meals 1-2 minutes later.   Good thing the onion rings were amazing. I had the chicken fried chicken and it was cooked perfectly and had a nice seasoning. The flat potato fries were a pleasant surprise with the perfect amount of seasoning salt."

It is as average as going to Jim's/IHOP (please don't be offended if you are a fan). But the price you have to pay for a side of onion rings (picture below), it was $11.99. Honestly, they were genuinely crazy prices for the quality and quantity.   The customer service is extremely bad. We were walked into our seated area. No one greeted us at a table until about 30-40 minutes in, and that's after we tried to get their attention. No one ever came back to check on us after the food was delivered, and we were even having a hard time to get the check. I personally wouldn't go back again."

                "description": "Must see! Everyone that comes to Gruene has been to the Gristmill. It is located right next to Gruene Hall and the water tower. This building is historic and used to be the cotton gin. I enjoy looking at the building every time I come here. I included a bunch of pictures so you can see the charm of this place.  I got seated right away but if you are coming on a weekend be prepared for a little bit of a wait. They do not do reservations so plan ahead. The good thing is that they have a ton of shaded outdoor seating if you have to wait. For an added bonus you can often hear the music from Gruene Hall.  I ordered the club with fries and it was great. Their fries are the best and I have never had a bad experience here. My wife also got the club sandwich and she loved it.   I have also done work events here and you can rent a room in the back. The service is always great which is nice being this is a tourist attraction.  If you haven't been here before then you have to put this on your itinerary while in Gruene. You won't regret it!"

                "description": "This was probably the coolest restaurant that I went to while around San Antonio area.  This was actually previously a factory of some sort many moons ago.  It looked as if not much was changed from the original, or they just made it look that way.  I have to say, if you like AC while eating then it's best to find another restaurant.  They have fans and shade.  So when you walk in, it's right in the town of Gruene (pronounced Green), you can easily park in the little towns parking lot and just walk (if you're able).  My aunt informed me to NEVER come on the weekend or you'll be waiting a very long time because it's a hot spot.  Off to the side of the building there are countless benches that have mist oscillating fans so you don't have to pass out while waiting in the heat.  They do have live bands that come for entertainment, and an outside bar to order drinks while you wait.  I mean, if you have all that in the waiting area then it really must be worth it.  Luckily we sat right down on the week day.  We were given the option to choose inside or outside.  We went for outside. Now this restaurant has so many levels and stairs that lead you to the back of the building.   The waiter was fantastic, the food was incredible.  All-in-all it was a good experience.  I didn't talk too much about the food because you're more so going there for the atmosphere, and Gristmill definitely wins."

I have been here many times and give the place 5 always because of location and ambiance and the he have had to -1 for food with the comment that sometimes the food is a five and other times it's a 3.   But I come back because it's a really cool place and when there's live music it's even more cool, yea more better.   I don't recommend the jalapeÃ±o margarita as it makes my lips hurt but I do recommend the jalapeÃ±o poppers because even tho they are hot the taste is so good you would eat them if they were shooting flames.   Have fun!"

The meat and gravy had no flavor. The green beans were good after you added the seasoned salt that was on the table.  It's a shame that the prices go up, portions go down and the quality goes down. The service was very slow. I found out the waitress was new and overwhelmed. We still gave her about a 30% tip because she was new.  I will say that the queso was good after we added pico to it.  Probably won't go back. So many other places are better for chicken fried steak."

This restaurant is massive with nooks and crannies everywhere!! They also have an outdoor live music venue but unfortunately we weren't there foe the night life .. The food was delicious and the service was great  . If you go at night make sure to get in the wait list ASAP. We ate our food and then explored the town some to help digest all that good grub !! We stopped at a couple shops and got some ice cream as well !! I can't wait for our next trip to the river and this cool little town !!"

                "description": "We usually eat at the Gristmill every time we are in the area. It's pretty much our go-to. This last visit was on a Saturday evening that had a fairly big concert going on next door at Gruene Hall. We are anticipating a wait, but our quoted wait of 90 minutes turned into around 2 hours before being seated. Understandable as it's a busy place, but disappointing none the less.   We had come chips and Queso along with a frozen Sangria while we waited in the courtyard area for the text saying our table was ready. The snack was needed to keep us from getting hangry and the frozen Sangria was wonderful.   Once we were finally seated, we pretty much knew exactly what we wanted to order. No beating around the bush so to speak.   On this particular visit, we went with the Pasta Poblano Salad and the Beef Tenderloin Sandwich. They asked me how I would like the beef cooked. I requested \"Medium\" and they delivered. It's not your normal sandwich but man o man is it delicious!   It's summer time, peak tourist season. I fully expected a wait. I believe the staff was trying as hard as they could to get people through the door and to their table. I won't complain too much.  We'll definitely continue coming back to the Gristmill when we are in the area."

The rooms were all wonderful with the large fireplaces.   Our server was Chloe and see was very efficient and kind. My wife loved her fish but was did not love the round fries as much because she thought they were a little soggy. The crispy one were great. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was perfect. The sauce on the side was great. The mash potatoes were very tasty but could have been hotter. I love hot food. It is a issue I have with all restaurants.   This is a beautiful building and we will definitely come back and enjoy the river once COVID is over. I bet the outdoor band areas are great in the summer. All in all much more to love about this place than minor little things."

This time we stuck to appetizers and were much happier. The Spinach Quesadilla was cooked just right with a perfect blend of spinach and cheese where you could taste the spinach, not just cheese. As good as that was, the Tortilla Soup was absolutely delicious! Spice was applied to give plenty of flavor without being hot, and the chicken was delicious, tender and juicy. Even the margaritas were good! Definitely worth the stop for a quick bite to enjoy the view overlooking the river."

There is a wait but you can always put your name on the waitlist and walk around the Gruene area. Just a warning, they do not take reservations nor put your name on the waitlist over the phone.   We ordered the onion rings, spinach artichoke dip, and shared a medium well ahi tuna because their servings are huge. The onion rings are huge, good, and fresh out of the fryer. All of the items we ordered were delicious and recommended.   Lastly, the service was great despite it being a very busy Sunday. We sat outside - love the ambience of trees, the Guadalupe river and of course live music in the background. The small bugs are something we could not avoid due to it being summer time and the trees around so definitely bring bug spray.   Overall, I recommend this place if you're in the New Braunfels area."

I called in an order (only a waffle with fruit and a latte. I was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I had brought my dog to get her out and let her hang with me on the patio; but she is a rescue who sometimes gets nervous in public places, especially if I'm not right next to her. Since my friend was taking a while to arrive, I was forced to leave my dog out on the patio by herself. She started shaking as soon as I walked away. I thought, \"I'm just gonna grab my food and should be back in under a couple of minutes. No biggie.\" WRONG.   There was a group of 3 people together ordering when I walked up and 2 other ladies behind them. I'm thinking \"5 minutes tops\"...Nope. The woman behind the register (though nice) was taking her sweet time and it took literally 15 minutes for her to take the first 3 people's orders. The 2 other ladies in front of me gave up and left. I didn't know if it was the customers who were so rudely slow or what was going on. Of course, I had the added stress of wanting to get back to my dog (no one's fault but my own); but the line got so long due to the slowness that it was curved almost to the side of the building by the time it was finally my turn!   After 15 minutes (and multiple people in line looking at each other annoyed and even making comments to each other about it), the 3 people finally walked away and it was my turn. I realized very quickly that the lady behind the register (a redhead with black glasses) was the issue. Again, I don't mean this as a personal attack because she was friendly; but my goodness, she does not need to be behind the register at all, let alone when the place is slammed.  There needs to be a separate place where someone is just picking up a to go order and wants to pay and bounce. By the time I finally got my food, my latte wasn't ready. So I went back to my dog and starting to eat. The waffle was totally soggy (from sitting there so long) and they put maybe 6 little slices of strawberries on the large Belgian waffle and maybe 6 thin slices of cantaloupe (I was told it would be strawberries and blueberries) when I asked and not only do I not like cantaloupe but also it's not a good fruit to put on a waffle anyway).  I was told to come back in \"2 minutes\" for my latte. I gave it 5 mins, walked in, nothing. Came back a few minutes later and he had finished making it (no other drinks were waiting at the bar); but somehow the latte was only lukewarm. My total for a soggy waffle with a few pieces of fruit and a latte came out to just under $19. Yowza.   I will continue to support the Austin Halcyon location but will certainly never go back to this one again. The guy behind me in line said the same thing.  I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) simply because the two employees I interacted with were nice."

                "description": "I came here even through it was less than 4 stars because I know sometimes people can be tough on restaurants but I should have gone with all the averages reviews and not came.  To start of the Benedict's English muffins were not cooked and they were smothered with cold butter, yuke .  Then my wife avocado toast to and out and it wasn't toasted and sent it back and waited almost 30mins and had to remind the person who brought out the food.  Lastly, my son's omelette was over cooked and smelled of it.  Listen, I'm a big foodie and appreciate quality food and don't mind paying more and in fact prefer but maybe what they need is to deliver quality food and not focus on just serving a long line.  Hopefully this doesn't fall on deaf ears, you've been warned.  Quick update my wife toast came out and still wasn't fixed and only half of it was toasted.  What the hell is going on here? Here is a pic to show proof"

Indoor and outdoor seating available which is nice. My only quarrel is that there were A LOT of flies inside. They were buzzing all around and even though inside was nice it didn't feel very clean at all. But my main issue was with the flies, I was kind of shocked with how many there were. It is a nice spot though and the coffee was actually really good so I think it still earns four stars in my book.   Pro tip: get the latte of the week it's usually something dope!    Overall: 3.93 stars"

The place is hot. I work up a sweat in about 10 minutes just from sitting. I had trouble connecting my laptop to the wifi and was told to join a server (by an employee) which did not seem to work at all. I ordered an iced London Fog and a Turkey Brie sandwich. I got a hot London Fog (in August??), my sandwich and a different bag of chips from what I ordered. There are also a bunch of flies in the eating areas. This place is so cute and has the best vibe, I've just been sad my last two visits. :("

                "description": "Super long wait and you can't make reservations. They seem to be severely understaffed so we did our best to be understanding about the crazy slowness, especially considering they had hiring positions on the front door.   They used to have $1 champagne flute mimosas and $2 wine glass mimosas. Maybe due to COVID it is now $3 and $6, which is still better than every other brunch place especially considering they give you 90+% champagne with a splash of juice, the way it should be :p i hope when the world \"gets back to normal\", they'll bring those back.  We got lavender mimosa and the grapefruit mimosa. The lavender one was too sweet for my taste, and the grapefruit one was alright.   I got the goat cheese arugula toast, and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the southwestern skillet because he was \"suckered into ordering it because of the sweet potatoes\", but sadly noted he couldn't even taste any sweet potato. The dish was too greasy and everything in it just tasted like grease.   We got the overnight french toast per a review recommendation, as a celebration for his birthday. The top half was delicious and rich, but the bottom half was literally burnt (pictured)!! I can't believe they would serve something so obviously BLACK and burnt. If i made that I'd cut it off and most definitely would not give it to a guest."

Stopped by to get a coffee while waiting for brunch in the area. Not busy at all, COVID measures were taken, masks required and work by staff. Social distancing was enforced as well.   Outside patio was open to sit and was a perfect spot to let the sun peak down on you while sipping your cup of joe.  Always greeted with a smile when I arrive so I am sure I will definitely be back."

                "description": "We were so excited to eat here but everything was a let down. We waited around 30 minutes to get seated. After being seated it was another 10 mins before our drink order was taken - 2 lattes, 1 hot chocolate, 1 smoothie and 1 coke. 20 mins after our drink order was taken we get our coke and smoothie, the waitress said the lattes and hot chocolate would be another 5-10 mins. She also took our food order at this time. 35 mins later our food is delivered (still haven't received our 2 lattes and 1 hot chocolate) and every dish but one was cold. Country style Benny was wrong and cold. Husband asked for sausage gravy on it but got chorizo gravy, asked for side of bacon - no bacon, asked for crispy well cooked potatoes - they were hard and way undercooked and all of his food was cold. He also ordered a plain waffle with whipped cream - it wasn't brought out with our food. My daughter ordered the s'mores pancakes, it wasn't made how it's described in the menu. There is no graham cracker crumbles - instead two graham crackers are thrown on top. There is no homemade marshmallow topping, instead a few large marshmallows thrown on top, there is no Nutella drizzled on it, instead Hershey's syrup. Her pancakes were also cold. My son ordered the French toast. Flavor was good but again it was served cold. He ate most of it with his hands because it took another 15 mins for him to get his silverware. This is when our 2 lattes were delivered (room temp, not hot but not cold)  - still waiting on 1 hot chocolate too. My burrito was the only dish that was served warm but the filling wasn't what I ordered. I asked for bacon, sausage, egg, cheese and potatoes plus avocado. It had no bacon and also had ham. Even though it was wrong, it was still good. My daughters hot chocolate finally arrives and I ask again for my husband waffle, it quickly comes out with fruit all over it (we asked for whipped cream only). The waffle was good and warm.  The bill comes and I ask the waitress to remove the extra bacon charge since my husband never got it. That took another 10 mins. She brings the iPad back so we can pay and she already had 20% tip added and asks for me to sign. Sorry, but the service we got wasn't worthy of any tip to be honest. I changed the tip to 15%, which was very generous considering my son ate almost his entire French toast with his hands because it took her that long to bring him silverware after we asked for it repeatedly. Stay away and go to IHOP instead."

No greetings at the door, or employees telling you what is a designated place to order (all while you and other customers are standing around not getting acknowledged or instructed).  Less then stellar customer service by the employees taking orders and getting overcharged (based on the menu prices). Ordered a  Vietnamese iced coffee ($5) and a Long Island iced coffee ($10) and my total came out to $18 and some change.  When I asked about the curious total, I was met with a shrug of the shoulder answer and not with a itemized receipt. I tipped a dollar and thought that I was maybe misinterpreting what was going on.  My wife and I then stepped to the side and waited for our drinks (all the while another couple gave us a side glance and a smirk as to say \"they saw what was going on also\") We waited on the side for our drink. A couple of drinks were put up on the bar top and not one time did a barista yell out a name or a order. After a few minutes my wife approached the table and saw our name written on the ticket (a iced drink that was sitting on the bar melting away). The barista then said , yes that is yours if your name is on it. We went with friends from out of town and were proud to brag and boast of our city and what the new development is bringing, but after this performance we were left with mud on our face and the \"charm\" of Texas to be all but a thing of the past."

Instead of grabbing a tray she decides making 5 trips with a few things at a time is better. I'm now waiting an additional 10 minutes just watching them work, granted they were doing stuff but there wasn't enough staff and the lack of efficiency was killing me. The table is clean so I think she'll come back for orders since now the line is out the door and she starts rolling silverware.  I left without any coffee and I was first in line but I figured at the pace they were moving it would be another 30 minutes. This is the second time I've come at around noon and have waited too long for coffee."

For something that should contain seafood in it, it did not have enough to be worth $16. I also ordered the Sea Bass entree. That was also very well made, but not worth the $40 in my opinion.  Ended the night with a slice of cheesecake. It was good, but not great. The crust was too soft.   Service: our waiter was great! Checked on us quite often and ensured we were taken care of.

Their menu is very average for a seafood restaurant here in San Antonio for which there is plenty of competition.   They completely fail with their ambience, which I consider as important as their food. You have to have both in the stiff  competition of the San Antonio seafood restaurant scene.    The place is like eating in an empty church. Dark and dreary with the worst lighting I have seen in a daytime restaurant. Dim lighting overwhelmed by glaring  large-window brightness, making it uncomfortable on your eyes no matter where you sit.  Their background music is so low that you have to stop and listen for a faint chord you might pick up ever so often.   This is supposed to be a festive new Orleans seafood kitchen instead of a quiet room for meditation in a church.  They had better change their trajectory and fast."

Server seemed busy but always very attentive. Food was taken out by the manager so it assured an extra level of attentiveness. I liked that.  Kids plates came out first: both large in size and tasty, so even a teen would feel satisfied with the size of the meal. When I finally got my Chilean Sea Bass, the fish was so meaty, juicy and delicious, just reached another level of perfection. Couldn't stop complimenting the flavors from it, lol. The capers blended the flavors of the fish (and I don't usually like capers) together with the Julienned vegetables, paired with a the sauce made for what looked like spaghetti underneath the fish, made for an exquisite meal! I enjoyed it so much with my Cabernet. Couldn't stop gloating over my food, lol! Just Wow, amazing perfection! I tasted the Diablo plate and was very spicy. Not for the faint of heart, but still amazingly delicious. We left extremely happy. There was a line of people waiting at the door to be seated still... This place is so popular! I recommend it to anyone who loves seafood! Best Mother's Day dinner, thank you!!!"

                "description": "NICOLAS MAHI MAHI FISH with garlic spinach, mushroom and oysters and shrimp in a sherry butter sauce with white rice.  ($27.99 btw)  Long time residents of the area, we've been going to Bourbon Street Seafood Kitchen since it's opening and this is the first review I felt compelled to write.  We celebrated our 39th Anniversary by having dinner at our favorite seafood restaurant, Bourbon Street.  Unfortunately it was a far cry from the prior times we've eaten there.    We were happy to see the place seem to be doing quite well, despite the rainy weather.  There were a few groups ahead of us but we were seated in about 15 minutes.  Not bad.  We were promptly served warm bread and oil and ordered our drinks.  Our waiter was genial but we'd like to point out that the restaurant is noisy and it's difficult to hear which is made worse by having the waiter/servers wear a mask.  Noisy restaurants seem to be a thing nowadays. But I digress. Along with speaking up, please explain the specials louder and clearer. Oh, and before I forget, PLEASE provide coasters for drinks. Personal pet peeve but I'm not fond of sweaty glasses that drip on you, your food, the table....you get the idea...I mean, it IS Texas.  Do sweaty glasses bother anyone else?  Back on track.  My wife order the Seafood Cobb Salad:  SEAFOOD COBB SALAD Shrimp, crabmeat, blue cheese, tomatoes, avocado,  bacon and boiled egg tossed with raspberry dressing ($17.99)  It's a favorite of hers and she felt it was good, but not as good as she remembers it being. Definitely worth boxing up and taking the leftovers home! It's a large salad.   Unfortunately, my order was waaayyyy worse than what we, (me), expected. The plating was pleasant and looked appetizing. I guess the problem is in the execution.    The Mahi Mahi was extremely dry and overcooked. I mean seriously overcooked.  I tried a couple of bites and it was not good.  Was not moist, not flaky at all and well, seriously overcooked.  Which brings us to the sauce. I had to double check, but I wasn't able to find any recipes that added mozzarella cheese to the sauce.  Parmesan crusted, yes, but not in the sauce.  If the sauce was liquid or even a thick liquid, it would have made the fish easier to get down.  As it was, every forkful was like eating a slice of pizza with the cheese thick and gooey and that you have to stretch the piece of pizza till the cheese separates from the pie.  That's good for pizza, not so good for a sherry butter sauce. As a matter of fact I couldn't readily find a sherry butter sauce that has cheese in it. Not saying there isn't or that there is only one place that does use it, (Bourbon Street) but it was NOT a good idea. It made the sauce a gelatinous mess.  The flavor was ok, plenty of spinach and garlic but that's about it.  The menu says \"mushroom and oysters and shrimp\". I think they meant \"mushroomS, oyster (1) and shrimp (2)\". I don't believe the addition of another couple of oysterS and shrimp would have been enough to save the dish though.  Plenty of white rice. Too much I think. It easily dominated the plating. A wild rice or even brown rice would have been a nicer balance to the relatively bland dish.  I will confess, I did eat the 2 shrimp and the one oyster. Tried two bites of the Mahi Mahi and had to give up or swear off Mahi Mahi forever.   When the waiter, 8 Gabe J, eventually came by, my wife had finished her salad and asked for a take home container.  When I was asked if I wanted a container too, I explained to him what the problem was and that I was done eating it. After a moment of silence, he asked if I would like it to be remade.  Hmmm.....not sure what that entailed, reheating or entirely new, but I wasn't brave enough to push my luck.    Normally, when it rarely happens that we get a bad meal, a manager will inquire as to the service and food and why it was sent back.  Didn't happen. Normally, if a meal is sent back, it's taken off the ticket. Didn't happen. Occasionally you may be offered a dessert.  Didn't happen. Normally we refuse both, when offered. Didn't get a chance.  On our way out, I stopped a busy looking guy with lots of pens in his pocket and asked if he was the manager. He said he was.  I explained my problems to him and asked if it was normal to add cheese to the sherry butter sauce.  Both he and the waiter said that they thought they did. If so, so be it.   Lot longer than I expected to share, but hey, when you're on a roll.....  My wife and I both feel that when a place excels at what they do, it should be recognized and we do.  If there's criticism of the service or food or whatever, it should be recognized.  Obviously we do that too.  I'm sure we'll return.....one bad experience doesn't outweigh all the positive ones we've had dining there; I just hope it doesn't take another pandemic or 39 years to return!

                "description": "I really enjoyed the food here, I love Cajun food so when my friend mentioned this place I was excited to check it out.   I was really craving some oysters so I ended up getting the oyster sampler, which had three or maybe 4 different types of oysters on there, so that was pretty good and filling. I also then got the crab cake that was on the appetizer menu. It was soooooo good! It was actually a pretty good size the sauce on it was so flavorful. I loved my meal.   The one thing I'd say though is it's a pretty pricey place. I had these two appetizers and a drink and it was almost $40+   So definitely not a place I'd go on the regular, but worth a special occasion or a treat yourself type of night."

                "description": "Oh my heavens. We came here for our anniversary. It is the best food I've had in a good long while. I think the prices are very fair for the food and portion sizes. We've paid more in NOLA at our favorite seafood restaurant, Superior Seafood Company. I had the Eggplant bayou and my husband had the seared scallops. The scallops were perfectly prepared, and, honestly, that's why you leave it to the experts! The eggplant bayou comes with a saffron cream sauce that I could eat as a soup on it's own, it's that good. The service was prompt and the server so friendly. They still have reduced capacity and wear masks, although it seems optional for the patrons. I see they have crepes on the lunch menu, so I see many more visits in my future. This is right at the Redland exit on 1604.  I just wish I had a picture of the dinner. We finished with the pecan bread pudding with bourbon sauce, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Oh and fresh whipped cream."

We were wondering if we were too early, if traffic was that bad, etc... Got our food and figured out why. The quality of the food had dropped considerably from before. Now it wasn't bad, just not as good as it used to be.  The specialty drinks were great. The gumbos were good, we liked them.  The Po Boy was ok, nothing special but not bad, just average. Although the baked oysters $36 of garbage. Pretty much inedible. The crab topping was off, it tasted like it was on the verge of gone; the bacon overwhelmed the oysters, and the cheese was so thick on all of them that it needed to be halved and it still would have been too much. Too bad, we used to like this place."

                "description": "There was no one at the hostess stand when we arrived, so we had to wait a few minutes before the manager showed up to seat us.  We seriously thought about grabbing our own table for a couple of minutes because nobody acknowledged that we were standing there.  I was afraid this was going to set the tone for service, etc. but luckily, it didn't.  Once we were seated, the service was VERY professional and efficient.   The food: The jambalaya ($18.99) had PLENTY of chicken and sausage - the chicken was chicken breast and was very moist - not dried out, which is easy to do with chicken breast.  However, the jambalaya demi-glaze sauce and rice, seriously was no better than one of those instant mixes out of a box or a bag like Zatarans, etc. the sausage tasted very similar to the local SA brand Kiolbassa.  I just wasn't impressed with this dish, based on the $18.99 price tag it flaunted. Who charges $18.99 for jambalaya???   The Pontchartrain Redfish entree ($31.99) is pan seared, served with mushrooms, crab meat, and shrimp in a brown butter sauce, served with dirty rice on the side.       Glasses of wine range from $8 to $15.  Beer (Abita Amber) is $4.75 for a 12 oz bottle.   Substitutions are frowned upon here. The redfish entree includes two shrimp, but we asked if we could substitute scallops for the shrimp.  The cost was going to be an additional 4.99 for the first scallop, and 5.99 for each additional one after that - but we were assured they were large scallops.  We took a hard pass on the substitution and ordered it with the default of two shrimp.  This dish was better than the jambalaya entree.  The fish was cooked perfectly - not too dry and a good flavor.  Although the service was great, and the food wasn't too bad, it will be a while before I return.  It's just too pricey for the quality and ambiance.  There's a handful of other places that I would rather drop this amount of cash on."

I'm sure at one point that's what it was. They do have daily specials, but drinks can get pricy.   The front of the bar looks a little run down. Once inside, you have your typical bar feel. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the bar staff. It was during the day, so the inside of the bar wasn't busy, but the back patio was. They had a dj playing popular tejano, Cumbias, bachata.  They also had a food truck on site which made it perfect for Sunday brunch.   We took advantage of their mimosa set up. It included a bottle of champagne, orange juice, grapefruit juice and mixed fruit. I also wanted to try their $4 tecate light with Tony topper special. I'm glad I did. The tecate can is topped with tamarindo rim, a slice of pickle and Chinese candy. It does make for a good combination.   Staff was always around to take your order.   The only con is that the bathrooms were out of order and they had Porta Potty's. They were so gross. I held it and made it home, but that only meant that I had to limit my liquid consumption.   Parking is street parking."

While I did think the prices were a little high for the area, what do I know about running a bar? Perhaps there's a special some day I don't know about. What I do know. These margaritas SLAP (as the kids say). Oh yes. A properly made marg? Now that's rarely found. Check it out, and while you're at it, try a house shot.

                "description": "Listen, don't come to Tony's expecting anything but a family owned dive bar. That being said, do come with plenty of cash because they are a cash only establishment with affordable beer and wine and you'll end up staying a lot longer than originally planned. I don't come to Tony's nearly enough as I should, because this place just reeks of nostalgia to me. From the iron made Tower of Americas outside to the handwritten signs peppered throughout, this is a place my grandfather and his compas would hang out at.  Their micheladas are always affordable and come in a big frosty mug. Their micheladas are simple and to the point, clamato with no frills. You can tabasco to your own liking and they sell chili candy to add to your drink if you feel so inclined. This is a domestics/imports only bar, you won't find any craft beer here. And as a craft beer lover, this is just fine by me.   Tony is the owner/bartender and he's as sweet as can be. Every time I've come in he's asked me what channel I want the TV on and will change it. No real wait for the drinks because they're all pretty simple. They have great bar snacks at an affordable price too.   I couldn't agree more with another Yelper who described Tony's as the quintessential ice house.  tl;dr: Cash only, cheap drinks, friendly atmosphere, puro San Antonio, come here often!"

                "description": "The reviews of this place piqued my interest and I knew I would have to visit. So we walked over from the Alamo brewery (or whatever it is called). Now, that walk was an adventure in and of itself but we made it. The sign out front said \"Open for Beer\". Yes, please.  So, wow. This place. This is a proper, off the beaten path dive. It was super dark inside. There are tables, a bar at the back (very small), a stage off to the left, and TVs on the wall. A pool table was in there too. Apparently, this is a Cowboys bar too. Good for them. Anyway, there were two people inside when we rolled up...and one of them was Tony. Cold, and I mean fucking cold, Miller Lite in the bottle and he provided us coozies to use as well. Cash only (I think). We drank our cold beer and decided to play the jukebox. It is full of Latin music, but not the Latin music that is filling up my iPod. More old school Latin but we played the fuck out of it like we knew what was going on. Oh, and some random George Strait.  As we sat there drinking all of a sudden a round of beers materialized from the other patron in the bar that wasn't Tony. So we shot the shit with him. Then another person came in and another round materialized for us. Very nice although not necessary. We enjoyed the front patio tables a little bit too. But in the end it was getting dark and we had somewhere else we needed to be so we rolled out into the night and bid Tony a fond farewell.  This place is a legit dive. LEGIT. No frills, just cold beer, football, and a chill time."

They welcome newcomers. Beer is reasonably priced. Usually at least one female bartender there, I believe his daughter. Another I've seen a handful of times, Usually wearing some Buddy Holly style glasses. Both good sense of humor, quick witted, The best kind of smart asses around, but always welcoming and friendly. Never rude. Beer only, cash only. Bring your own liquor. They sell the mixers to make drinks.And I believe I've seen them cook out for big events. Family owned and operated, they make a great team. I look forward to this bar continuing to grow and flourish"

The owner Tony is very personable and treats all the customers like family.  The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing.  One of his bartenders Mary was inside when I arrived and remembered me from my phone call earlier in the day. She even served me a plate of chips and queso when the game started.  Service doesn't get any better than that. There is only beer and wine on the menu but what else do you need. This place is a must !"

                "description": "I was attracted to this bar for several reasons. One was the fact that Tony's is a mere quarter-mile from work, and the other - there is a miniature Tower of the Americas erected outside.  The inside of Tony's Bar is half-sports bar, half-lounge, and kind of reminds me of Cheers... but the Mexican version. ;)  You have a small bar area for about 6-8 people, and the rest of the place is old-school tables and red neon diner-style chairs.    The big screen is usually on sports (a.k.a. Cowboys) and when it's not, count on ESPN or ABC.    The drinks are that of a no-frills bar - you have all the basic beers plus some Mexican bottles and a few mini-wine bottles.  Alas, no Heineken.  The prices are great, though.  $2.50 domestic, $2.75 import, and $3 Smirnoff and those little Barefoot wine bottles. Tony even sells snacks like chips, crackers, queso, etc.  Apparently, there is live music performed at Tony's often but I haven't seen any yet.  So that's when the big jukebox in the right corner comes in handy.  Outside are a few wooden benches and, again, that cool replica of the Tower made out of steel.    Tony Lopez is a very down-to-earth guy, and his family are usually with him in the bar at night.  He always tells his patrons to drive safely, even me after only downing a Dos XX and a Smirnoff. But I like this place... it's very friendly... and cheap... and the parking is free in the lot or on the street!    They're open Tue-Fri and on Sundays when \"games\" are on... I assume that means Cowboys... ;)"

                "description": "We went to recently reopened Fruteria during its soft opening. The decor has been updated, and the menu has changed. Luckily, the drink menu statyed relatively intact. Postives: the decor is cool and the restaurant looks new. The drink menu still includes all the refreshing twists on margaritas, polomas mojitos, etc. that we liked. I think they added the \"Mexican Manhattan\" which was really good and strong. (I like that but be aware). My wife went with the very refreshing cucumber and vodka drink. Excellent. The service is still friendly and efficient. The food was very tasty, but I did miss some of the choices on the old menu. We actually were hoping they might have some of the seafood dishes that his since-closed Villa Rica served. We shared the Plantains in Mole Coloradito to start. It was really good. I generally don't love mole, but this was exceptional, and my wife does not like bananas, but liked this dish. (Why did we order something that had ingredients that neither of us were wild about? I don't know: the combo just sounded good, and it was). For dinner, my wife had another appetizer, the Chicken Tinga Quesdilla. It was fabulous. Best of the night. I had Shrimp Aquachile. Also very good...especially the sauce. Very light, citrusy and flavorful. I was still hungry so we ordered the Tuna Ceviche Baja Style. It was very good, but seemed a bit heavy on the salt in the soy sauce.  So...all comments here are good to very good. Why only a 4? We dropped over $100, and still left hungry. Portions are very small. My wife is an extremely light eater, and she was still hungry.  All-in-all, we'll go back."

We ordered a few rounds of cocktails which were very good, but we were disappointed by the menu items and execution. For an appetizer we ordered one of the ceviche items and the fish was very tough and the corn kernels around the fish were dry and inedible. For entrees we ordered the mushroom quesadillas which were tasty and shared the carne asada plate. The beef needed a bit more flavor, but was not bad.   Originally we were eyeing the lunch menu not knowing it was only for lunch, which sounded a bit more up our ally, so maybe we'll have to give it another shot and come back for lunch. Overall, I was disappointed by our dinner experience here."

They have some infused tequila drinks, I ordered the pepino and it was refreshing and very tasty. About the food, we ordered: The quesos appetizer. It was ok, different. Just too sweet for my taste.  The carne en su jugo was not good, it was a small portion, the sauce was slimmy (because it  had nopalitos, but still no excuse) and the meat was over cooked. The chicken tinga quesadillas were ok. Nothing special. The place has a lot of potential because it has great atmosphere, they just need to step up their game on their food."

So we made the 30 min plus drive to pick up food here. Seems like they are practicing COVID-19 guidelines here when I picked up the food. I had two tortas: the bistec and al pastor. The pastor meat itself was really clean and nicely cut for the torta. There was also pineapple in the torta. Overall the pastor was alright. The bistec torta was much better. Quite savory and the cheese complemented the bistec meat nicely.  The prices were definitely high for the quality of torta. The house made chips were good too. While not the best tortas I have had, this place is at least good enough to try again in the future."

There was a wide variety of Margaritas, juices, and dishes to choose from that it was a little overwhelming at first.   I ended up going with the Las Fresas Fruteria Infusion Margarita. My husband ordered Los Pepinos and then the Caipiripina. All of their drinks are inspired by flavors found in Mexican Fruterias. The drinks were not too sweet and not too boozy- simply refreshing and flavorful! We also had an order of the guacamole and chips. The chips were freshly made, and I could not stop eating them even though I wasn't even hungry. My husband wanted to try their carne asada and queso tacos. These little tacos were amazing! I was sad that I wasn't more hungry, because I would have wanted to eat an entire order for myself!   The staff was attentive and friendly, and we all enjoyed a relaxing afternoon of chatting over a few cocktails and snacks. Definitely coming back on a future visit!"

                "description": "Another great lunch at The Fruteria - Botanero! Today it was the Torta de Bistek: chopped tender steak with grilled onions, creamy queso Oaxaca, avocado, lettuce, and tomatoes. The lightly seasoned beef and salty Oaxaca were a nice pairing as they complimented each other. The bolillo itself was soft but sturdy with a nice crunchy crust. Great vessel to hold the fillings.  The housemade potato chips were an excellent side - crunchy, lightly salted, and not too greasy. Proof that something simple can be expertly made.  Only issue was the service, it started strong but flatlined once served our food. We were checked on once towards the end of the meal as the server disappeared. Empty cups and a need for more salsa (tiny bowl for 3 grown men) were a theme. I would sit at the bar next time to avoid service issues."

And their consistent excellent service has bumped this review to 5 stars.   Yesterday we were looking for a late night bite around 1030. We went to another place that basically told us to get lost when we walked in, so we ended up here at the Fruteria instead. Even though they closed at 11, the waitress was very welcoming and friendly. Her warmth was contagious and I'm glad we ended up here."

                "description": "Been (dragged) here 1/2 a dozen times at least. The food is haute tex-mex in several ways, the most obvious indicator being the price. They're very proud of their little tostadas and big salads. Most offerings are presented in heavy white dishware that is decorated with whimsical little motifs that match the interior design. Most of what comes out of the kitchen looks really good even though most of what I've tried has been underwhelming in the flavor category.  I have to admit, the Milenesa torta packs a bold punch, but the bread seems like it could stand a few more minutes in the oven, but I'm no torta expert, so it's plausaible that the lack of crunch is intentional. Anywho, Fruteria has some fun and fruit-forward drinks, and yes the menu has some unique qualities, but for the price, I'd expect a tad more. Like maybe adequate staffing. Waiters don't seems to smile or say much, and maybe for good reason. On my most recent visit, our waiter was also playing hostess and bartender. Given the circumstances she did a great job, but it's no wonder we didn't see her very much."

What a view to look at, especially if you appreciate what mother  nature has to offer.   At the moment they have karaoke on Thursday and live music on Sunday's. I enjoyed my visit here as it allowed me to wind down from the city life. The patrons are very friendly and the waitress was friendly and helpful as well.   The food was not bad at all, the full order of nachos was quite a treat, enough to feed a group of 4. The burger was not bad at all.   My only set back which kept me from givIng this place 5 stars is that it's a smokers paradise In here. By the end of the night there was a pretty good cloud of cigarette smoke lingering above us. As a matterr  if fact if you are not a smoker you will definitely be bothered by the smoke. All in all the  view from the back patio is what I loved the most here."

The beer was not cold, the burger was mediocre at best not, cooked as asked, way over cooked and cold. Only half as many fries and they were cold from the start. It took over 30 minutes for food to arrive, even though no other couples there. It was such a disappointment because it was so good the first time. Will never go back there and we only live a mile away, what a shame. All places at the lake aren't worth the trip, even from Lakehills."

This was just an outstanding joint (warning they smoke inside) in the middle of nowhere with a really cool vibe (think Grateful Dead), an outstanding patio with a view of the Medina Lake and dam.  Nice menu and we ordered the batter fried mushrooms and nachos, beef on the side.  The mushrooms did not look batter fried, but no matter! Because by god these were chicken fried and fantastic! They obviously used slightly older mushrooms that had a perfectly concentrated earthy flavor excellently balanced with a crunchy tasty crust..I mean I could happily eat 63 baskets of this stuff ..and want more. Coupled with an Anchor porter, this was heaven. Nachos were just nachos, but the beef was well flavored with a touch of cumin and warming heat that made for tasty eating.  They have a pretty nice selection of beers for such an out of the way place. Add friendly service, and this is going on my out of the way place rotation!!"

So we left and my better half said let just drive up Culebra Rd and see where it will take us and I told her Medina Lake so she said well the first bar we see we'll stop and have a beer there and if it sucks we'll move on that's when we came across the Dancing Bear Bar and my first thought was wow look at all these trucks and Bikers parked here we should have brought my truck and worn my boots cause I was wearing my Sperrys at the time and didn't want to feel out of place,but screw it let's go in and check it out anyways. We see what look like locals sitting at the bar having some beer conversation and people did check us out but no uncomfortable long stares,we ordered our beers and went out into the patio and that's when we knew we came here at a perfect time cause the sun was setting and you can see the beautiful view of Medina Lake with the sun rays dancing on the water very nice and then with a cold beer come on!what more do you want spoke to soon cause that's when the band started their first song Copper Head Road I started thinking to my self glad we came here and never knew about this place even though I use to hang out at Medina Lake like every weekend back in my twenties and watching the sun rays dancing on the lake brought back memories and smiles. At first I felt little out place cause we was like the only Hispanics there LOL and top of that it was St Patrick's Day,but no rudeness here. We didn't try any of the foods but I hear the burgers and mushrooms are really good and I will try it out on our next visit. This is a cool bar with bikers,cool cowboys and just down to earth blue collar people who work for a living my kind of people!Come check this place out and see for your self I know I will be coming back when I am not in the mood to do the  Pearl Brewery,St Mary's Strip or Southtown. You know that song I love this bar listen to it its how I feel about this bar."

I had the burger with bacon, delicious! Fries were perfect, hot and crispy. German beer was one of many that I wanted to try (if I didn't have to drive I would have tried more!). The view of the lake from the patio was great, very relaxing. The staff were attentive and courteous.   We are glad we stopped here. It was a completely spur of the moment stop. The first impression was bad because of the smoking inside but then we saw the patio and went outside. The smoke actually blew out from the inside of the restaurant towards us and more people came and sat outside and smoked too. Our clothes and car now smell like smoke.  The staff were VERY friendly so we decided to give it a chance. It turned out to be a good choice for all the reasons mentioned above. Will definitely go back  in spite of the smoking."

                "description": "Not my place... I love to go to sports bars, restaurants, and other hangout spots prior to any events or sports games. I was heading to a Spurs game later that night and thought I'd kill some time on the Riverwalk beforehand. But I wasn't really impressed with what came with this place. Not too much to talk about, but I'll try my best.  They have several drink selections, most of which aren't really that good. The only really good beer they had was Crawford Bock, and they don't really have any of their signature city beers from the brewery; only plain old domestics that I can get anytime at a dive bar. On top of that, I was wanting to try a cocktail or mixed drink of some sort, but I got a recommendation not to because they're limited on their supply, and don't really have any good selections. Oh well, I can always try another good cocktail bar elsewhere.  Another complaint is that the music is WAY too loud. It was blasting when I walked in, and I didn't mind it at first, but it can get annoying at times. So, I let it slide, but if it's not for you, don't bother sitting down inside. The outside seating is spacious though on a good day, so I would suggest that if you want to try this place.  I've been to better sports bars in my life, and I don't think I'll be back. But the staff was friendly, and able to provide me with good locations along the Riverwalk for some dinner before a show or game. But I'd say it's not worth my time."

I got 1 margarita 3 kids drinks and an appetizer nacho!!!!!! Why was my tab $43.79 they up charged on the only meat they had, which fajita beef was 5.99 which was also not listed on the menu.   I love tipping. I worked in the industry  and believe heavily on tipping!!!!! Please don't expect a lot if you come here. Ohhh my margarita was 13.99 and was small with no alcohol."

Probably the worse restaurant I've ate in recent time. STAY away from this spot it is not worth the overpriced food"

                "description": "We stopped into Agave Bar for a quick bite while walking on the River Walk on a Saturday afternoon.  Even though it was a little chilly outside I wanted to sit outside and admire the River Walk.  The hostess happily got me a blanket and turned the warmers on around us.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the 60 oz margarita because why not?!  Their chips and salsa were pretty standard... nothing to rave about.  We decided to get an order of queso and split a chicken quesadilla.  The queso reminded me of when we make velveta with rotel at home... it was good but not the delicious white queso I was hoping for.  The chicken quesadilla came out hot from the kitchen.  The chunks of chicken were pretty large on the quesadilla... I almost wish it was shredded.  The bathrooms were very clean and smelled good.  I didn't expect much from Agave Bar.... let's be real it's a tourist trap on the River Walk.  Our service and food were good.  Would I go back... probably not.  But it served it's purpose to get us a quick bite that afternoon."

After being seated we waited about 15 minutes to place our order (the server was rude from the beginning). When our drinks finally arrived they were already melted ( which we didn't complain about). However when the nachos we ordered finally arrived, after taking a couple of bites we noticed a hair it. We then called the server over and informed her of the situation and she did not say a word, she just rudely picked up the plate and left. We waited for her to come back for about 30 minutes and she never said anything about the food. So we finally asked for the check as we were reading it over the server said \"I didn't charge you for it\" with an attitude. I do not usually write negative reviews but this place was overpriced and no ever apologized about the situation or try to make it better."

The food is decent and the portions are big enough to make your tummy happy most meals. Right on the river walk, the large patio has mariachis and across the water, so do other restaurants.  Super touristy, you know you're going to get \"cat called\" by all the restaurants and bars so that you come dine with them. Definitely fun and worth the stop at happy hour!"

The ingredients for this place:good ambiance,mix of different ages,good drinks and good looking women equals a pretty cool place to have a few drinks or lots. The wine selections is minimum but they do have a decent selection of bourbons and whisky. Their cocktails are pretty good especially the Sazerac and my favorite the old fashion among other cocktails which they make potent and that's alright cause that's what most of us are there for right?Like any Hotel bar the drinks can add up so keep that in mind. Waitresses are very attentive as long as your nice to them and tip them cause they seem to stay with the tippers and it's beats waiting in line on a busy night. On cold nights you can take your drink outside and sit besides the nice fireplace or check out the lobby it's original and unique. The crowd is a mix of wealthy, blue and white collars,young,middle and older crowd but for the most part not much drama just good cocktails and laughter.The restrooms are attentive and clean and are located outside the bar there's also a family restroom but don't take your date in there.

This bar has been closed off for awhile and only open to hotel guests during the pandemic, but it has recently opened to everyone.  I came here with a friend on Friday at 5pm and we got the last two seats in the entire bar. I was shocked that it was this crowded so early! The space is large and has high ceilings, but the ambiance is still very cozy and classy. The lighting is dim and the colors are darker. Definitely didn't feel like I was in San Antonio. Guests are spaced out well to follow social distancing guidelines.  We ordered two cocktails: Kingfishers Catch Fire and People of the Sun. Drinks are pricey but worth every penny. Both cocktails were on par with those found in a NYC speakeasy. We didn't try any appetizers, but I would definitely be interested during my next visit."

We had the Salami and Brie Cheese Plate and the drink is called Lucile's Day Out. The cheese and meat plate was perfect for sharing if you're not looking for a meal. All the cheese and meats were good and the jam included was very complimentary. The drink was very delicious. It has bourbon, banana liqueur, amontillado sherry, orange, lemon. I'm not a big drinker but it was so good, I could've easily had 2 or 3. The waitress said that the drinks get rotated every quarter or so, so you should stop on by soon as I think it's only available another month.   We also had a cute regular lurking nearby.  Will be returning for the food, drinks and cat."

The cauliflower with caramel popcorn - who would have thought of such a combination? It was phenomenal! Loved every bit. I hope to go again soon - maybe the coming weekend again!"

                "description": "Decided to give this place a second chance because the first experience wasn't so great. (TLDR of previous experience: Host sat my girlfriend and I, and then argued harshly with us a few minutes later that the table we sat in wasn't our table... even though he specifically WALKED us to it.)   With my second experience here... again, super awesome atmosphere, but I feel like we were specifically sat in a terrible spot because the Host didn't like that we were checking in vs checked in (at the time it was hotel guests only). I got the impression he thought we were lying.   I suppose I could be oversensitive or not self aware of my demeanor with my last experience, but then I see couples come in right after us and they are getting sat in way better spots that were available before we sat. Im literally writing this review while I sit in this broken chair. If you get sat where there are two chairs \"alone\" in the middle of the room, you definitely have the worst spot in the house in my opinion--especially for a Valentine's Day/couples seating.   I can for sure say I will avoid this bar in the future which sucks because the potential and atmosphere is awesome. I just can't seem to get a positive experience with the hosts and seating. I'm trying hard to gauge if it's me.   It's clear there is a demand for this. If a bar opened up with a similar atmosphere and had better customer service, they'd knock this concept out of the park and put this bar out business. â€"

We ended up waiting 2 hours (on the long side of things) Got called to the front, when we arrived the host openley stated that he forgot calling me...   We ended up being seated on a shared couch and told we could sit on either side. The host had stated that the woman that was there previous, had taken the left side, so we sat on the right side. The woman ended up coming back and plopping down (in an authoritative manner) on the right side next to me. Management quickly came back, he had strictly told us to get up and move to the other side because that's where the other woman had decided she wanted to be. We immediately got up and left only to be chased by the host asking what the problem was LOL. â€  They need a lesson in guest relations. Will not be visiting again."

A horrible representation at best.... Upon arrival it took us 10 min before we were greeted by anyone. Waters were the last thing to come out upon request. As food arrived on the table it took me getting up after another 10 min to receive any silverware. Everything we ordered was incorrect and had to ask several times to get this corrected. We hope we can rectify this situation as I'm sure this has the potential to be a wonderful bar inside a renowned hotel."

The last 4 times we have attempted this, we have been turned away because we were not guests of the hotel.  There were maybe 20 total people in the bar.  We are an attractive couple in our 40s, well dressed, don't smell, and usually run up a very nice bar tab.   Not real sure what they are trying to accomplish here??  Reserve a 10,000 SF bar for patrons only??  20 of them??  Or maybe hotel Emma is not real keen on locals??  What a shame because we have spent lots of $$ in there and bring friends regularly.  Will NOT be coming back.  There are bars that want our $$.    Side note.......a friend who is a local transvestite (no judgement) walked in 10 minutes before us and was sitting in the bar while we were being denied.  Hmmmm........Cmon Emma.

It's so smart how the make it with just the ingredients and out the sauce on the side.  Makes a huge difference!  Believe me, the food here is completely satisfying.  I want more!!!"

When they finally handed it to her she headed our way. We don't live too far from the place, but decided \"why not order in.\"  When we FINALLY got it delivered it was literally cold pizza. Looked like it had been sitting out for a good while. If the favor runner was there and the pizza had come out and was handed over to her in a timely fashion and we received it hot like we and anyone else would have expected this MIGHT have been worth it but at this point everything with this order tonight was just a waste.  When we called about the pizza being cold we were told the warmer was broken but the favor runner said she'd ordered it fresh and was waiting there for the order so if it was made fresh like the box it came in suggested then it'd still be hot to moderately warm once it traveled the FOUR (4) minutes to get it here.   To top it off they gave us the wrong cheesecake.   $40+ for a medium sized pizza and the wrong cheesecake. Ridiculously overpriced, cold, AND wrong. Disappointed and a WASTE $40+.   Definitely wouldn't suggest ordering."

We came on a Monday evening and the pizza was only $10 for 3 toppings - what a great deal! My only complaint is our waitress. I don't understand how she went from being so attentive to so non-existent. We could see her attending to other customers next to us yet she did not check on us for roughly an hour while we waited for our pizza.

                "description": "BÃ¡rbaro this one is a tough review because I've come here in the past and would recommend the menu and establishment to any one that loves pizza. However our recent visit was a bit of a disappointment and I do give grace to the complexity of the pandemic and impacts on restaurants.  We were immediately seated and the menu had a good selection. This spot has a a lot of options for meat eaters not so much for heavy pescatarian or vegan eaters. The wine and cocktail selection is good. We tried the peach mule and margaritas during the night happy hour, both well made.   Check out the late night menu for pizza by the slice and $5 cocktails which can save you money.   The calamari gets 5. The breading, fried peppers and jalapeÃ±os in the mix sets this apart. Loved that it was super hot and we could tell it was fresh made.   The lighting is very dark inside so if you are looking for a bright, large and active place this may not be it especially at night.   The pizza which should be the star is where this experience was subpar. We ordered the Sicilian and a regular pizza came out. So we waited for them to fix another which want a bad wait time and when it came out then we notice they are using regular black olives vs kalamata olives which is in the menu and what asked for. You can't just replace a kalamata with black olive chef they are totally different with a very different flavor. The dough was thick as advertised but the pizza overall did not wow us. It lacked something, flavor. We picked off the olives and ate around it and we didn't want to wait for something else.  I appreciated them comp'ing the pizza but I didn't have a full satisfying meal. We wanted a good night out and this is 40 min ride for us. Last recommendation is to see if you can add in more seafood, or shrimp to put on pizza"

We came during their brunch hours on a Sunday, but only saw their lunch/dinner menu.   We split a medium pizza, which was enough to bring some home. We got pepperoni on the whole thing and anchovies on one side and kalamata olives on the other side. They were very generous with the anchovies. The olives were finely diced, which made it easy to have some in every bite.   We got a side of giardiniera. The portion size was nice and you could tell it was made fresh. The vegetables were crisp and it wasn't overly pickled.   I'm not sure what the parking situation is here. We parked on a side street and walked a couple of blocks."

No table were available inside, but he offered us a seat at the bar or outside. We chose the bar because it was full service. My girlfriend wanted to order drinks while eating so it was the perfect option.   The bar tender was very attentive to everyone at the bar with drinks. His Old Fashion and Lemon Martini were incredible. Sabra and Steven were our bartenders for the night. INCREDIBLE!   Aside from the amazing drinks, the food came out hot. The flavor (Egg Plant Parmigiana and Spaghetti) was terrific. Prices of food, in my opinion, were very reasonable. As well as the drinks. I didn't have any interaction with the rest of the staff but they very busy helping the other patrons. However by observation I would say they were very attentive.   Bottom line- highly recommend this place for lunch and dinner is"

My friends and I arrived at Barbaro around 6 and were told there would be a 45 minute wait, which is completely fine so we got some drinks at the bar and waited outside chatting. By the time 6pm rolls around, there still is not a table ready and we're done with our drinks and ready to eat. We were seated around 7:30p ravenous. We were given water right away, but it took over 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to out table. We obviously ordered right away at that point. I ordered a medium carbonara pizza, which was covered in white sauce, bacon, black pepper, and parmigianno-reggiano. The pizza was really really good. I even had leftovers that lasted a few days and even those tasted just as good. After ordering, I didn't expect the turnaround to be quick, so we waited about 30-40 min for our pizza, quite enjoying it a lot. The kicker is after we ordered our pizza around 7:50p we did not see our waitress until around 8:45p...even asking other employees for her to come to our table to cash out. She didn't apologize once or try to give any sort of excuse. So, it took over 3 hours to have dinner at a pizza place which is just absurd. It seemed like there were a decent amount of employees working, so I'm not sure how it took so long to just have basic service. The music was also SUPER loud, so it was hard to hear anyone talk. There are plenty of other good pizza places out here that would have better service. I would give this place 1 star if the pizza wasn't actually really good, but I will not be back."

                "description": "I sadly made the choice to order online from Barbaro last night thinking it would be easier and quicker than Grimaldi's. When my boyfriend went to pick up the pizza he was told by the restaurant that their online tickets weren't printing and he would have to wait another 30 minutes for the order. While I can understand technology snafus, not even offering a discount or a free drink while he waited is just poor customer service. In addition, once the pizza arrived at the house... It wasn't even warm. We had to put it in the toaster oven. The quality of the pizza was average, not much flavor and crust was dry. I am noting 2 stars because we did also order salads that were excellent. For 50.00 plus dollars... this meal was disappointing."

                "description": "The first time I came to Barbaro was in 2017, I loved it. Food and service and was great. Last night I came for a late dinner with my significant other. That was my second and last time. I hate to say, but the bad reviews here are accurate and I should've heeded the warnings. I really hate picking places apart but I feel Barbaro needs more feedback and maybe I can save another innocent patron from a bad experience. So here goes....  You can't have roasted tomatoes as a $2 pizza topping and serve hot sliced tomatoes lol. Look at these pictures and then google roasted tomatoes. Shame on you Barbaro. Secondly, pizza is clearly undercooked. Why would someone want to eat slices of raw dough with slippery cheese and hot cherry tomatoes.   Our server, who's name was never given to us, came by twice during our whole 50 minute experience. Once to take our order and then once to ask if we wanted a to go box when she the raw pizza sitting on the table, no longer being touched. She was very standoffish and hardly attending to us.   I politely expressed that the pizza was not cooked and asked if we could just pay for our drinks. She said \"oh sorry to hear that\" and left in a flash. Lol. Didn't care to address anything, didn't offer to remedy the situation, didn't even offer to get us more drinks. So I felt maybe it's just standard for Barbaro to not care about retaining patrons and they did not want my business. Eh, so be it. After waiting another 15 minutes for the bill. Our server said thanks and dismissed us in a flash.   Sad to say, my 4 year hiatus from Barbaro should have remained permanent. That was the worst food experience I've had in a while. Good luck, hope you all can get your act together and do as well as you did back in 2017."

The karaoke DJs, LiGaya and KimBo, are the liveliest hosts I have ever encountered.  They sing, dance AND interject comedy.  Mind you, while it may not be for the faint of heart you are guaranteed to have a ton of fun!  BEST... SHOW... EVER!!!"

Stayed durning Christmas - ended up at MDB everyday - simply because that it was open later than most other places around that area and it was FUN to hang.  Waitresses are friendly and work super hard, they were constantly moving fill orders.   our regular waitress was Faith - Love Her !  The food is decent - we had cottage pie, cheeseburger and hot cracklings (basically warmed up pork rinds - they were really good). It's everything you would expect from a British type pub,   If you're in the area looking for decent food and a fun time head over to Mad Dogs.  Cheers"

They were short-staffed for Christmas Eve night which is understandable. We had run down and get our own silverware so we could eat before our food got cold. Our server did check on us periodically and was running her tail off so we didn't take it personally. Now, the price was a little high but that could be because I ordered a $40 glass of Johnnie Walker Blue. Glad I did before going out and spending $175 to try this whiskey. Definitely not worth the money for this whiskey. All and all, this was a pretty darn good restaurant."

We noticed a small sign on the table advertising a tuesday special 5 dollar frozen daiquiri.....yes please!  The service was as good as the grub.  The men's restroom wasn't Buc-ees but it was close.

Mad Dog has a nice patio good shade, so we sat on the patio. Greeted by the hostess and our waitress very good service. They do have a good indoor sitting area with a large bar if want air-conditioning. When it is very hot, I would go inside.  The food is British pub fare I went with the fish and chips. The fish was fried well a very big piece of white meat fish. Not heavily battered fish very good flavor I would get it again. The chips or fries were good the coleslaw was prepped very well. I love tartar sauce with my fish and Mad Dog had some very good tater sauce. I asked for more because the fish was so large.  It was Sunday and they have drink specials we had a couple of mimosa with our meal. We had a nice time at Mad Dog great location for sitting and people watching on the river."

The interior was amazing that feels like you go back to a specific time.  Food: The food was good, there's some that not much really worthy but the egg appetizer was good and fish and dips. The crusty bread with meat and egg on top and meat below, they were the same aside from the top. It's not that good for me. The spinach dip was really good but you can taste the chips was from a bag and kind of stale a little. The beer was amazing especially the one they recommended but for food, it's only few we liked.

I came here on my last day in San Antonio. I was a little off kilter because of a variety of events that made me feel stressed. Shortly after being shown my seat for lunch I get this panicky call from work just as Helayna, my waitress, came to greet me. I feel horrid because I have to shake my head and gesture I can't talk right at that moment because panicky work call. I get that resolved and apologize for my rudeness but I feel sprawled out with the work backpack and cords and the whole nine yards.   I feel like an absolute mess.   But Helayna seemed completely unfazed. She smiled at me happily and told me not to worry. She was an excellent waitress checking in on me frequently and making sure that I had what I needed.   I ordered the fish and chips after finding out they were allergy safe. I recall being in London and I will admit this is more classically a UK fish and chips than ones we are here in the US. I can't say it was the most flavorful that I have had, but I still thought the fillet was good and those fries were very easy to eat. The cocktails, too, were very good. I am happy that this was the last place I had lunch."

I'm a vegetarian, so we always have to scope out the menu before we pick a place. And we were surprised to see a few items I could eat, mostly since this was \"pub food\". I think we got one of the best tables in the house, it was outside, on the top level, and was on the river side.   We didn't see mimosas on the menu, but we asked for them, and I got one. Our server also offered a manmosa, which honestly, we weren't listening when she said the ingredients. And it was a little strange. I recommend sticking with a regular mimosa.   And then there was the food!! We got an order of buffalo cauliflower and both ordered the portobello sandwich. The cauliflower was thick and flakey and soft and covered in soft and it was soo delicious. The portobello was amazing! It popped with flavor. The grilled peppers, shroom and cheese is a winning combination.   Our server was super nice and we even got our picture taken by a rotating photographer on the river."

Friends and I spent several hundred dollars here throughout the night and end up getting cut off due to a glass slipping off the table on its own and smashing. This place doesn't know what good business is. Clearly, based off their previous reviews this place is a joke. Don't come here if you're tryna have fun. Go ANYWHERE ELSE but here. This place is full of incompetents."

                "description": "I'll preface this review by saying you pretty much get what you expect with twin peaks. Ifyou're coming here for happy hour, they have great food /drink deals. M-F 2-7 happy hour.  $4 mozzarella bites, queso, or fried pickles. The mozzarella bites are always solid. Good drink specials. I'm majorly disappointed in the cost cutbacks they've made regarding food. I used to be a huge fan of the chicken Cobb salad that was LOADED with blue cheese, chicken, eggs, cabbage, carrots, and bacon. This time when I got it it was majority lettuce. I didn't find any blue cheese or bacon in the salad at all. Our friends always got the appetizer platter as their meal and they cut back on the size for that as well. So if you're coming for drinks/to watch a game it's great. Otherwise it's meh."

Pre-covid, I was travelling for work, and I would try to visit locations throughout the country whenever I could. San Antonio has 3 locations. I visted one SA location 3 years ago. This is visit number 2, to a different location in SA. I got seated right away, and the person who sat me was also my server. She was really nice and attentive. The place was busy. Employees were wearing masks and they had divders placed in between certain tables and I think at the bar. Started off with some chips and salsa. Peaks and Chuy's have the best chips. Maybe the same provider? My main meal was the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, minus tomatoes. The sandwhich came out nice and hot, same with the fries. It was cooked and prepared perfectly. I highly recommend."

                "description": "So the food at this place is relatively good. The billionaire bacon and the burger that features this bacon happens to be one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. From the seasoning to the toppings, the burger gives you a perfect bite from beginning to end.  I decided to order wings and I feel like Dr. Nowzaradan from my 600lb life was shaking his head with disapproval. Maybe that's why they were red beneath the surface. Yep. I received wings that were undercooked and paid for it royally. Special shout-out to the Pepto Gods for the special stomach coating that shielded me from further harm or danger.   I'm hoping Yelp leaves this up because this is the absolute truth.   Case in point, don't be greedy. The food is good but don't go overboard. I'd rather order takeout because I'm not there to scantily clad women. I'm in it for a good burger and the scrumptious bacon. But for the wings this place would have 4-5 stars."

                "description": "Okay so lets face it not many men or women to a certain extent go to places like this for the food. Beautiful women, drink specials and saturation of Sports and music coming from every corner does make a meet up or after work winddown especially inviting. So I met my buddy there looking forward to a meal I actually enjoy here The Chicken and Waffles only to find out thwy no longer serve them. Saddness and disappointment. But that's alright.  Our welcoming cute Pixie server Vida informed us they were still only using online menus. I always thought that was cool unless you didn't have a cellphone, then well therescan awkward moment of havi g to look over at other tables to see your options.  I opted for the chicken and shrimp with a side of Mac and cheese ( the best part of the plate) the chicken strips were tiny and the grilled \" blackened\" shrimp were light on flavor and sparce. I was a little disappointed in the portions as it looked more like it came off the kids menu. Fortunately they have a decent dessert menu. I ordered the apple turn overs. Vida informed me they were her personal favorite, she had to cut back on ( slight eye roll in the vain of absolute forbidden deliciousness) she was on point they were good, really good. I only wish the rest of my meal was at that calibre. I do enjoy going there, I don't drink and realized a long time ago that the women are beautiful but it's there job and they do it well. So I'm left with gsthering with my buds for a couple of hours of comroderery, maybe some binle study ( just kidding) and the food. As far as that goes, TP you need to bring your game back up because your slacking. If the food was as good as the service that would be fine with me."

The server, Sabrina, however was quick to tell us she was behind on service and she had to take care of a big party first. We gave her our drink orders and she didn't bring them back for 10 minutes.  We ordered chips and salsa and the chips came out before the drinks. However, the chips were covered in oil from the fryer, but were cold.  We didn't get to order our actual meals for 15 minutes and they when they came out, it was really disappointing for my son after his game. The fries were thrown on the plate, burger looked smashed down, and didn't have any if the sides in it. He was too hungry to send it back.  Never coming back. I have been let down by this location for the last time. Get better management. I'll make the trip to the other location in town, but they're not great either."

Ordered them to-go and the girl working there was completely clueless saying things like \"uhhhh I think so\" when asking if we could order as many flavors as we want. Typically we get to pick 2 and didn't trust her so we picked lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan. The wings came out with no flavor. Hardly any seasoning and the garlic parmasean just tasted like garlic.   Post-stay-at-home wings were disgusting and slimy. I don't know if they are just using old inventory to make up for lost revenue but they were some of the worst, flavorless wings I've ever had plus they forgot our side order of fried pickles. They did not seem to be respecting the required 6' social distancing as the parking lot and lobby were full of people.  If I could rate 0 stars, I would. I don't care too much for going somewhere to eat for girls, at least get the food right...garbage of an establishment."

Got breaded wings dry rub. Very dry. Finished my beer 1/2 way through the wing. But glass at the edge of the bar. Took a while for the barmaid to come check on me I had to stop one to get another beer. Not the idea of sitting at the bar.  Probably won't return to this location. The I-10 one was much better.

Walking up to the hostess they both looked miserable we got no greeting or anything they just looked at us until I said table for 2 please. Our server came up took our drinks and appetizer order which came out cold and right before our actual food order. Our server was not very attentive or friendly she wouldn't give me the time to actually order or ask for anything she would quickly drop off refills after a while and just walk away without asking if we needed anything. Our appetizer, food and drinks from the bar all got dropped off at the table by different workers and our server never came up to ask if we were okay till the end when I asked for a to go box and the check. If you are not a group of men giving all your attention to these women I would not recommend this place they will not give you the time of day."

The food was excellent and the young lady taking care of our fairly large group split into 2 tables (kids included) took excellent care not to forget about us. She was super friendly and paid extra attention to the kids table. In my book that's worth double the tip, which we were happy to oblige. We were able to enjoy ourselves and not have to worry if they were having a good time too in this very grown up place.  Will definitely be holding more gatherings at this location."

                "description": "Met my parent here for dinner tonight! Loved the atmosphere and set up of the restaurant! We got mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and I will say they had some marinara sauce that had a little kick to it. The crust on the mozzarella sticks and a lot of seasoning as well, but if you are one who likes that then definitely order these! I split the lobster Mac and cheese with my mom and we both loved it! Tried some of my dad's steak as well as the green beans and I was very impressed. There were parts of the steak that weren't as tender than other parts of the steak, but I still really liked it! I am typically not a fan of green beans, but I'm assuming they were cooked differently with different seasonings and I thought they were so good! Definitely want to come back here again!"

                "description": "Ehhh, this place was just ok. The appetizer we ordered they were out of one of the items so we substituted more wings which was fine. Nothing other than the wings on the appetizer was really good anyway so glad we got extra wings! I ordered an old fashioned and it was made with regular ice vs 1 large cube so it watered down VERY quickly which was a bummer. EntrÃ©es were so so, Nothing great but nothing terrible either. The place was pretty dead for a Saturday so I'm assuming this wasn't a fluke for the subpar food and drinks. Service was ok, again nothing outstanding but not bad either. In a large city there are so many better places to eat and grab a drink so I don't think we would return sadly."

                "description": "This place has been very consistent in service and food. Today I tried their deviled eggs w bacon and paprika and I've had their steak on my previous visit. I had a zombie last time and it was a great treat if you like rum. Definitely consistent on flavor and made with love.  They have many options for all types of cravings and hunger levels. I tried their peanut butter old fashioned this visit and this is a delicious, unique twist on the old fashioned I will return for. The atmosphere is classy and laid back at the same time. Definitely, my type of environment. The customers were mostly dressed up with some in casual wear. I like that the bar wraps around so you have the option to sit inside or outside. I chose outside since it was a nice day in the 70's with good cloud coverage. The attentiveness of the bartender (long dark hair lady ,Taylor I believe ) was perfect. I can tell she reads her clients. She didn't forget about me, but she left me alone enough to enjoy my food and entertainment. Great spot and never disappoints."

I tried to order 3 different things off of their menu and they were out of all of them. I settled for some absolutely disgusting Brussels sprouts that had an even worse mayo type dip that went with them. My husband ordered a burger that was good except for the bacon that he paid extra for was nasty.  My two children had okish meals. We paid $100 and left disappointed and hungry. Our waitress was very nice though.  Save yourself the time, money, and energy and go elsewhere."

                "description": "This place has so much potential but sadly, in my opinion, falls short. They are frequently out of items on the menu, which I guess you could chalk up to Covid but watered down cocktails and old wine are inexcusable. We ordered the French onion soup and it was almost cold, the wings were on par with something you would grab at heb and heat up in the oven. If they could get the food up to standard it could be a really great place. I think like us, most folks go here because they can't get In anywhere else."

                "description": "For this Saturday night takeout adventure I wanted to try a new restaurant so I decided on this place. I placed my order through GrubHub. I orderd Guiness onion soup,  druken pork chop with mac and cheese and the crispy brussel sprouts. The food was packed very well in plastic containers and still hot when it arrived. The soup had a good flavor which was perfect for a rainy day. The pork chop was a bit overcooked so it was tough to cut but it had great flavor and marinade so I powered through. The brussel sprouts were cooked well but lacked seasoning. Once I added some salt they were fine. The same for the mac and cheese,  no salt at all. Once I added salt and pepper the mac and cheese tasted much better. Overall I wouldnt be opposed to give this restaurant a try again. That pork chop sauce was really good. I am not sure if the offer bread when you dine in (didn't see it on the menu) but that would have gone great with my delivery order."

I got to try several different menu items such as their pork chops, ribs, meatballs, pretzels, and deviled eggs. Everything I tried was freaking incredible.  The inside of the restaurant is nice, clean, and sleek and the service is impeccable. They have several screen TV's throughout the establishment and they are strictly enforcing social distancing rules during these Covid times.   I recommend to all of my fellow yelpers to stop by and enjoy some tasty ribs, their Mac and cheese burger or any of their other menu items. You're going to love it."

The duck wings were pretty good but the fries to accompany weren't the freshest. Definitely would NOT order the chicken pot pie again regardless of it being a take out order, it seemed underdone and the potatoes were huge which seemed to fill most of the dish, the sauce was kind of sweet and watery with a ranch taste that just didn't leave me feeling well. The pastry that's on top just seemed like flattened raw dough and I just can't justify $17 for this dish when I could get more satisfaction from an at home Marie Callender's. To top it off we were missing our pretzel with the order so just be sure to double check everything is in the sealed bag before it goes out for delivery. This location has been here for a while so we decided to give it a try and it wasn't a total disappointment but definitely didn't hit the mark, might try to muster up the courage to dine here in the future for a second try?"

                "description": "Let's start with the good. The drinks were on point. My wife and I ordered the Irish mule and peanut butter old fashion (A traditional old fashion but with Screwball Peanut whiskey). Yes, it sounds like a very strange drink but it was good. The waitress was nice and attentive to us.  The Okay:  We also ordered their sampler appetizer plate. The deviled eggs were good. Everything else on the plate was below average. The chicken meatballs were way over salted and the wings were over cooked, very dry.  Main course my wife ordered onion soup and salad. The soup was great. Plenty of perfectly cooked onions and a very nice flavor.  The Bad:  My food on the other hand was not good. I ordered the double pork chops. The green beans were cooked well; still were crispy and not soggy mush. Honestly, that was the best part of the plate. The mash potatoes were over cooked, whipped and slated. They had a glue consistency. The bone in pork chops were over cooked as well and tough. It was one of those 5 minute chews on a bite. But that wasn't the end of our not awesome experience.  The Awful:  When I got up to go to the restroom, a mouse ran out of the kitchen, across my path and under a booth by the wall. At first I thought I had one too many but seeing the reaction of the group of women seated a few booths away, I knew what I saw. When I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and apologetic, she had mentioned she was just informed there was a rodent issue. Thinking back, the booth the mouse ran under there was a couple seated there they promptly left.  The manager did comp all of our meal minus our drinks and we did leave are waitress a nice tip, as this was not her fault.  All of this to say, the food was not up to their normal quality and they currently have a rodent issue.   J"

Keep in mind TBA has been around before the recent resurgence of hipsters and bar traffic this (once) low-key street is now getting.  Their cocktails here are great and I love the intimacy of this bar. They always have clever names and the cocktail selection is great here. It's a great spot to grab a few drinks and catch up with friends.   As a fan of Rye and Mezcal you'll see some stellar cocktails and some of them are even featured in their happy hour menu.   For those of y'all who are adamant about patio seating don't worry they got you covered. Literally since it's underneath a porch.   I'm always game for their bar food and trust me this isn't your average bar food whatsoever. They know their stuff and you'll be chomping down like the character in Mario. Whether you're hangry or have the drunchies you'll be in pure bliss.  Make sure not to blink while driving here or you'll miss it."

I don't venture over to the St Mary's strip too often, so take this review with a grain of salt.  Went here for a date. The place is nice. They have parking in the back and lots of room to sit, although my friend says it gets crowded. It was fairly tame on a Wednesday night.  So the place has a menu of \"signature\" cocktails. They all seem good but a lot of them seem to be mezcal based and I just don't like mezcal. I had a South Flores which was light and refreshing. It was also pink. But I'm secure in my manhood enough to enjoy a pink cocktail--tho I didn't order a second.  I switched to scotch after my initial drink. They have my current fav Glenlivet 12. That's a plus.  My friend had a Rye N Gosling which gets bonus points for the wordplay. She seemed to enjoy the two she had.   So yeah everything was cool. I like the music. It was a mix of 90s alt rock which was perfect. The crowd was definitely on the younger side--like early to mid 20s young. I'm not sure if that's usual but I did feel my age a bit. But everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.   Prices were fine for the area. I didn't notice what beers they had on tap but a quick survey of the crowd and PBR cans seemed to be the go to.  It's a nice place to take a tinder date for a drink or to catch up with friends. I'll likely not be back but I suspect they won't mind as I don't think I'm their target demo."

Lucky for me, the dude manning the bar remembers me from Boiler House (where he used to work at-he doesn't remember occassion or the year/occasion-it's all good since i dont remember him either).  Their recently added food offerings are good.  Their Caprese Grilled cheese stands out, especially when you combine it with the pickled cauliflower. Yes. Damn good. The Westsider - we do not know what was in there but it was good. So yes, their late night eats fill that void in your stomach but wish their drinks were slightly more consistent.  P.s. This place could use a cigarette smoker or two to make it great for some free second hand cancer and more ambiance."

Plus, it is off of St. Mary's street so parking is pretty easy to find.  It can get pretty busy depending on day and time but it is definitely worth it. Last weekend I walked up to the bartender and asked him to just make me something and I told him the type of liquor I like and he made an awesome drink.  We were sitting outside and one guy was getting a little rowdy, but he calmed down."

I was just thankful she found something she liked. She was thankful that they kept the doubles coming. She's got problems.   I explained to her that this is where you come when you want a good cocktail. She then proceeds to ask the bartender to make her another drink right after his first drag from his cigarette. He followed her request with a gracious sense of confusion. Now that she knows what's up, she'll come back with or without me. That bartender better be ready."

I wasn't nearly as impressed with this place as pretty much everyone else that has written about TBA so I'd take my review with at least one healthy grain of salt especially given that I've only been here one time.  That said, the cocktails weren't very interesting and weren't balanced very well to boot.  The crowd oscillated between completely barren to moderately lively during my two hour visit.  Bartenders were kind of standoffish without traversing fully into the category of rude.  The most interesting part of this bar was the artwork and the horrible movie I intermittently turned my attention to when my friend would leave for the bathroom.    What would potentially bring me back here is its close proximity to Tacos El Regio and some other above average bars and restaurants.  But standing alone, it wasn't my favorite experience."

Featuring an adventurous cocktail menu and bartenders like Danielle, I'd challenge anyone to find a request unfilled. On weekends it is packed in with locals...weekdays you can get a seat at the bar and pick the bartender's brain. Either way the quality is always top notch. Personally I like to start up at Cullum's Attagirl for great beers and chicken before hitting up TBA on a pub crawl; it never disappoints."

                "description": "Visited Austin and decided to take a drive down to San Antonio. It was about a little over an hour drive from Austin, TX. I heard good things about San Antonio, great for jobs, and a lot of fun stuff to do.  It was my first time and The River Walk was recommended by a few friends. When I got there my eyes lit up a bit because it was so many thing to look at and so many people walking around. Especially since the drive was mostly just land. So seeing buildings, shops, people, music and entertainment, I knew this place was going to be fun.   I spent a few hours here and left around 8 or 9pm.  I browsed, ate at TGIF and my friends had some fun drinks. We all also went on the little boat ride. It was not bad, I believe the price was right under $20 per adult and the ride was surprisingly long. I would say 30mins or so. It took us around to the other side of the river walk. There was a mall on the other side. I definitely need to come back because apparently we didn't get to explore all of the river walk.  The person we had that drove the boat and explained the history was really fun and entertaining."

Fortunately, I met up with my friend at the Alamo and it was an easy walk to the it.   So, after having walked it, I guess it's ok. It's a nice little walk-especially when it was so hot topside. You can tell that walk has seen some better days, it reminded me of those log flume rides at amusement parks, everything seemed wet and some of the maps clearly needed some refurbishment.  The restaurants along the section I was at was mostly very tourist heavy, lot of chain restaurants, nothing that really made me want to stop by.   I think we ended up walking it for about 20 minutes, mostly because I thought I saw someone I knew from back in the day on the other side and we had to find a crossing to double back."

We tried to go as a family with two kids this evening about 5pm and that was not like I remember with the crowds.  The river walk is extremely over crowded and not good for families in the evenings.  Every place we tried to eat at had a two hour wait time minimum.  The idea is wonderful.  The reality with a family now, is a nightmare.  I don't know what I was thinking.  Not good for small/grade school age at night.  I will say the Pizzarita's restaurant above the river walk saved our asses for dinner and the long wait times.  We will attempt a carriage ride.  More to come....  Yellow rose horse rides a must!  Great for kids and helps to avoid the crowds of the river walk!  The life right above the river walk is where the real fun for families is!"

It's super cute and the town does a great job of decorating with with pretty lights and making it an all around visual spectacle. The cruise down the river is so lovely especially at night when all these lights can be seen.  It seems that there are cool places all over the river walk and I'm sure I've only taken in a small portion of them. I just wish that it wasn't like 98% food and drink. Once you eat dinner there isn't a ton to do. And the bars on the river walk don't strike me as bars where you can just hang out and pass the time but instead like bar and restaurants. But it is a very beautiful and unique space that makes San Antonio worth a visit."

I honestly was just looking for a place to eat lunch. But as I walked outside, I first noticed the Alamo. Then, I heard some water fountains across the street and so I preceded to go downstairs only to find there to be more fountains and more water, leading me to the Hyatt hotel, and then this magnificent place that reminded me of a place called Venice that I saw pictures of before with restaurants, shops, hotels, condos or apartments surrounding this long path of water -- It was remarkably beautiful! Needless to say, I forgot about lunch... So after an hour walking along this path, I then realized there was a mall / shopping center here, which I decided to stop into and wander around for awhile. I then finally got lunch. But man, am I glad I got to come here, it was really cool; and I'll have to come again here some time."

You need to experience the River Walk at different times. It's much less busy during the day. It was such a nice walk and we really enjoyed walking along the water while checking out all the restaurant options and shops. We got pretzels and had a nice rest at a German bar with seating outside.  You can take a River boat cruise that run up and down the River Walk. We didn't do the tour, but it was interesting hearing some of the stories as the boats passed us by throughout the day.  Later we came back at night and it was packed, but you could still walk around. All the outdoor seating was full of people eating and enjoying themselves. We made reservations and had a nice dinner near the Wedding tree.   I recommend making reservations.  There seemed to be a lot of seating up and down the River Walk. It's nice just to sit and people watch. We even saw the place Miss Congeniality was filmed, which we gleaned from a passing tour.  I love our canal in Indy, but the River Walk in San Antonio is amazing! I think it would be fun to stay at one of the many hotels on the River Walk for easy access."

The River Walk, or Paseo del Rio, is a San Antonio treasure and the largest urban ecosystem in the nation. Tucked quietly below street level and only steps from the Alamo, it provides a serene and pleasant way to navigate the city. Explore by foot along the river's walking path or jump aboard a river barge for a ride and guided tour.  Just grab dinner in one of the restaurants on the river walk and enjoy the Vibe.

I recommend taking the River Cruise if you want to learn a little more about San Antonio and the River Walk.  We did that too.

The Riverwalk is below street level, and we accessed it via the stairs next to Hard Rock Cafe. The architectural feel is a blend of Venice and Barcelona, yet very Texan with the spirited lights and friendly Southern hospitality.  It was a bit difficult to find parking, and we found a lot across the street from the Hard Rock for $25. Suggest you plan the evening to start at sunset. This venue reminded me so much of California's Disneyland ride \"It's a Small World\". Truly magical if you have younger aged children."

                "description": "While visiting San Antonio for the first time I came here one day, as I heard a lot about the Riverwalk. The vibe is relaxed and the view is historic in a way. The river is cute and looks great as it meanders through this walking path lined area. Lots of interesting and fun places to eat and drink along the way. There are, unfortunately, a lot typical, touristy places too (like Bubba Gumps, Dick's Last Resort, etc).  Â  They have boats that'll take you on a river cruise up and down the river. Even though it seems a little touristy overall, it's something everyone should experience!"

                "description": "When I was planning a trip to San Antonio, everyone I talked to mentioned the River Walk-I knew this was a destination not to be missed. The 20-something mile winding river is surrounded by fun local restaurants as well as shopping. It is well maintained with plants, trees and flowers-I noticed several maintenance boats floating the river early in the morning carrying gardening supplies. This may be a future career aspiration of mine.  If you don't prefer crowds, morning is the best time to visit. I noticed that the attendance started picking up around lunch time and got busier as the day went on. But 9:30 in the morning? Very few people in sight.  The food options are great-lots to choose from, and every place we went had patio dining available. What's more romantic than eating on the water? Well, taking the boat tour would be, although we skipped that due to other plans.  If you're in town, it's well worth a visit to a least walk a few blocks down below the hustle and bustle of the main streets to the beautiful river walk area."

                "description": "I love walking the Riverwalk, especially at night.  Been here a bunch of times either on biz trips or when visiting family who live here.   Always a fun walk with so many bars and places to eat. From cheap joints to upscale spots. One of my faves to dine at is Beaudro's which has terrific guacamole. A fun spot to drink is Durty Nellie's for its piano bar atmosphere.  You can also charter a dinner cruise down the river. See live entertainment. Shop. Lots to see and do. Or just enjoy a stroll at night when it's all lit up. Can get pretty crowded and touristy."

                "description": "The only down-side of this tourist area is that it is designed to be a tourist area...  If you do not come to the River Walk expecting it to be something else, you will likely enjoy your visit.  The layout is basically a large loop, with pedestrian walkways along both banks of the river.  High- or medium-rise buildings flank it most of the way as well.  If you venture away from the core 'loop', there are quieter areas without much in the way of businesses.  These areas are good for a quiet, leisurely walk.    The loop itself is largely given over to bars, restaurants, tourist shops, and hotels. There are a number of national chain restaurants along here, like you might see ringing a large suburban mall or at a Disney park.  There are also some non-chain local places sprinkled throughout. Weekends, especially Friday / Saturday nights, are super-crowded.  Restaurants will likely have long wait-times and the walkways will be hard to navigate due to the press of people. We enjoyed Sunday evening much more than Saturday evening.  The Alamo is only a block or so away from the River Walk.   If you are considering staying in downtown San Antonio, it is worth staying near here just to be able to go out, take a walk, and people-watch. Accept it for what it is, and you'll likely have a pretty good time."

                "description": "Stayed in SA over the holidays and we were right on the Riverwalk...having been to SA for conference in the past I always looked at the Riverwalk as pedestrian chaos. This time however, was different.  Although still busy, we were able to just relax and enjoy. Take in the architecture, enjoy the colors that come with Christmas lights and boats running up and down the water.  We had dinner numerous times off the riverwalk and used it as the launching path for our morning runs south out of downtown. Its such a well-developed system of paths with a great history, its hard not to love it.  We stayed at the Hilton with a Riverwalk side room.   Its definitely an integral part of any visit to the San Antonio area."

                "description": "My husband and I went here for drinks tonight for the first time.   We arrived between 7:30 and 8:00 on a Saturday which can be busy. There was a bartender and a bar-back working plus a few other employees in the bar area.   We found a couple seats at the bar and a friendly manager greeted us, and got us waters and menus. A little while later another manager took our drink orders and prepared them. We decided to order an appetizer to share and a waitress took our order. She was friendly and knowledgeable. That was the only time I saw her behind the bar so I don't believe she was a bartender tonight.   After a while it seemed like a long time to wait for fries, so we asked the same manager who made our drinks if she could check on them. Shortly afterwards she brought them out, they weren't exactly how we had ordered them but they tasted good.   My husband finished his drink and set it toward the inner edge of the bar with his straw wrapper in it. The bar back and bartender passed us many times without acknowledging his empty drink or even making eye contact.   Finally when the manager walked through again she made my husband another drink.   We decided to get the check because and had to flag down the bar back. He told us our total and ran our card. I asked to see our receipt because the total seemed off. Apparently getting a printed check is difficult because he had to ask the bartender and she had to ask the manager. The total was off because they comped our appetizer since it had never been rung in.   During our entire experience, the bartender and bar back never spoke to us, made eye contact, or acknowledged us in any way until we had to request our check. We could see them talking and chatting with other guests though. They served guests to our right and left but just walked past us every time. They didn't seem to be in the weeds or overwhelmed.   I appreciated the service from the managers and that they comped the appetizer without us saying anything about it.   Next time we go out at the Rim, we'll head to a different bar."

We split some chips and beer cheese, which tasted off and lacked in flavor. We also split a Shepard's Pie, which was unremarkable, but fine.  The one star review is because we both got food poisoning from our meal. Needless to say, this was not the same Lion and Rose she remembered."

We went to the bar to get drinks where we were ignored by 5+ bartenders for over 10 minutes. The music was way too loud to even converse and no one was dancing, so what's the point? We then moved out to the patio where we were ignored by 3 waitresses in cowboy attire. I wouldn't go back there again if they paid me."

                "description": "We were really excited to check this place out since we heard such good things about it, but we're highly disappointed. The fish was flavorless, oily, and pretty much crumbled when we went to eat it. It was also incredibly overpriced for 16.99 and you barely got any \"chips\". At first glance, you wouldn't even realize that there were any in the bottom of the container. The coleslaw had no dressing/ flavoring on it and the sauce it came with ended up just being ketchup.  The shepherds pie was the saving grace, it was hot and flavorful to say the least. The green beans were also okay, they were cold and had zero flavor.  The staff was friendly though so that's great. Maybe we just went on an off day, hopefully it will be better next time we decide to try in the future."

The crowd was a great mixture of ages and races and I LOVED every bit about that! I am ALL about diversity. We went on a Friday night and they had a live DJ. They even have a small space to dance (which we totally did) and people eagerly followed because the music was awesome. Despite the amount of people (it was totally packed), the service was great. The staff was friendly and very attentive. We ordered the fish and chips, tuna melt, and ham and cheese sandwich. The plates are huge and can definitely be shared. The ham and cheese comes with mayonnaise and it wasn't advertised on the description, so I would just make sure to ask what sauces are on each plate before ordering. The food was better than the average pub food. We also found ourselves here during the day. The scene was completely different. It was very calm, they had no DJ, and there were way less people. They had all the TVs showing March Madness, and tennis, and the service again was great. The only issue I had was they ran out of a lot of things. One friend tried to order three different ciders on our Friday night visit, and they had run out of all of them. On our day time visit, they also were out of several liquors. I still recommend this place. If you're looking for a fun night with great music, but don't want to get overly dressed up, this is your spot! If you want a daytime chill place to watch sports, this is your place also."

I also enjoyed the sauces provided on the side.  We also had the Shepherds Pie, which had a nice flavor.  The Bangers and Mash was okay with the best part being the mashed potatoes.  For dessert we had the toffee pudding.  That was a huge disappointment.  It was far too sweet and could have used nuts or something to break up the sweetness.  The worst part is my husband and I were sharing it, so you can imagine my surprise when I am about to complain how cold it is he says it's burning his mouth.  Sure enough his side was scorching hot.  I guess they microwaved it unevenly.  I don't ever order dessert, so I was disappointed.  A lot of the beers we wanted were out.  I ordered a flight and it sits on a circular carrier, so the girl didn't know which was which.  She was pleasant enough, so I wasn't too put out.   My real issue with this place was the ambiance.  It was late evening, but very bright inside.  Everything felt sticky and the staff uniforms were tacky.  We felt this place seemed more like a chain restaurant (which we avoid) than a hip place at the Rim.  There are better choices."

                "description": "The WORST restaurant experience of my life. We sat outside and got a waiter who said \"I'll take one for the team and serve you guys\" after we waited for 30 minutes and had to ask someone to serve us. We got no waters and so I went to the bar to get my group of eight all waters and asked for four and got the first round no problem, then went back to ask for another four and no one waited on me for five minutes then when someone was available she went up to our assigned waiter and made her do it. None of our mixed drinks tasted like they had alcohol although they were priced like they should've. The only thing that was fast and good was the food. SEVERAL waiters passed by our group and were unhelpful and even to a point where one waiter looked at my friend right in the face after she tried to flag her down and walked back inside.   They were severely unstaffed and need to figure out a better system because the waiters suffer on behalf of a bad leader..."

                "description": "What can I say. What other words can I utter from my mouth that would surpass absolute perfection, nearly divinity, taste bud tantalizing, maddening obsession for more . . . I CAN-NOT get enough of Dough. It's too much for me. I obsess over my next visit. I have eaten here many many times over the past few years and they never disappoint. They never strike out. The day they do I'm going to cry!  This last time we tried many new menu items and they were all delicious! The warm creamy ricotta smeared on crostini was the fluffy little cheese spread you never knew you needed so much in your life! And with honey?? OMG! My mouth waters every time I think of it!  And the oak roasted olives made no sense. I never knew I was missing the experience of eating super hot, oily olives. They do have the pit so don't just jump into it, but if you have any sense you will put it in your mouth, remove the pit, and when all you have is olive, pair it with a bite of crostini with the warm ricotta spread and you will experience something amazing.  The B.T.B. Pizza (Black Truffle Burrata) was exceptional. Take a pice, spread the burrata all over it, drizzle some of that hot oil from the olives, then pass out. When you awake, repeat until full. I can't even look at these pictures without experiencing it all over again!  Our bucatini came out undercooked the first time, but we informed our waiter (who was fabulous, by the way) and he had them make us a whole new plateful. It was perfect the second time around. The noodles needed to be cooked a few minutes longer and they were. The sauce was delicious, and for the mishap, they took it off our bill. Absolute excellent service. We were so happy with the meal we didn't even care. But it was a very kind gesture.   So visit Dough, they will not disappoint! In all the years I've been eating here I have yet to have a bad experience. I just wish they still had the maple cake with pumpkin seeds! And the panna cotta! PLEASE???!!!"

My wife did not enjoy it much but I liked it. I would rate 4/5  Calabrian Wings - 1.5/5 I don't recommend this to anyone. Not that great and tasty  12\" Small Margherita Pizza - we enjoyed this the most. Almost 4.5/5 would be our rating.  12\" Small Fontina Pizza - 2/5 The pizza was not that great . I didn't like the taste of the pizza it felt sweeter in taste.  Tiramisu - 1/5 Not all good. It has more baileys in it than it is suppose to.   We don't mind spending money when we get good Food but we felt like we have overspend here with only 1 good pizza and burratas."

                "description": "One of the worst pizzas I have ever had. Purchased a large pizza for $30 tonight. A third of the pizza had nothing on it - only crust. The rest had barely any toppings which was sausage on ours. Cheese was sparse and didn't cover the majority of the pie. I can't believe they'd put such a pathetic pizza in a box.  I'd give zero stars if I could.   My son and his GF just moved to San Antonio and wanted to try it since it was near their apartment. I am moving their also. I won't be going there ever again. I was just fleeced out of $30 and it pisses me off.  You want a real pizza with a load of toppings - check out Flying Pie Pizza in the Pacific NW. Hell, my homemade pizza kicks ass on this pathetic place.  Skip this place a go elsewhere."

It was around 2:30 pm on a Tuesday and we had a short 15 minute wait drinking wine at the bar. The place is super cute and swanky. We got the burrata with prosciutto and salami for an appetizer, then their prosciutto crudo pizza and pizza with its house-made sausage. Everything was super fresh and delicious along with great service! Highly recommend!"

                "description": "My partner and I were really looking forward to getting a pizza here after we received many recommendations. We were soooooo disappointed to get this pizza, which is mainly tomato sauce and crust. We would not have spent $25 if we had any idea. After asking for more cheese we mentioned that other customers may become frustrated about this so it might be a good idea to describe the pizza before anyone else orders it. We received a thumbs up from the server and continued to have an extremely awkward experience after that. At one point in the meal my boyfriend even shook his hands towards the sky and cried \"Why are you doing this to me\". It was our one day to have a cheat meal after weeks of strict meal prep and all was wanted was some delicious cheesy pizza."

Came to San Antonio excited about the Mexican food, but THIS pizza was the winner of the trip. I can't wait to find a reason to visit S.A. again JUST for this pizza.  The Italian soda was also great! Also I have to give a shout-out to our great waiter, Michael. He educated us on the menu, ingredients and why this Pizzeria was so special. Overall experience was 100/10"

                "description": "I first learned about Dough from watching either Triple D or Triple G on Food Network and when I learned it was in San Antonio, I knew I had to go. I turned in my final portfolio of graduate school, so I decided to celebrate with some post-portfolio pizza.   The restaurant location is very inviting and has indoor and outdoor seating. I got there around 6pm on a Wednesday and many larger parties had to wait some, so plan accordingly. Additionally, I am not sure if this is every Wednesday, but there were half off certain wines and spirits.   As for my dinner, I appreciated that the virtual menu indicated which dishes had been featured on Food Network, which made my search all the more easy. I decided on a small (12 inch) Pork Love. It was DELICIOUS and the perfect amount for one person. The mozzarella cheese was the ooey-gooey you hope and dream for, while the plethora of pork added the perfect amount of savory and salty. The soppressata salami and speck elevated the dish to *chef's kiss* level and the spicy pork sausage rounded out the dish with a little amount of heat.    I will say my crust had a little more char than I care for and the plethora of pork weighed the slice down some, so I had to break out my trusty fork for assistance. However, these were easily overlooked issues because the taste was well worth it. Lastly, leftovers ate well.   Can't wait to visit again!"

We ordered the Margherita Pizza with  prosciutto and pepperoni pizza (both were size small which were roughly six slices each). Pizza wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be (slightly soggy towards the end). I also ordered a peach Bellini which was pretty good. There's plenty of seating inside and out so there was no wait (we went Saturday evening) but not much social distancing. The price for the pizzas are slightly pricer than other places I've been to."

I should have tried to identify which pork topping was putting it over the top then I could try it again without it. Crust is the chewy variety. I definitely want to try some other menu options."

                "description": "I have to start this with review with commenting on how awesome Robert was! He provided the most excellent service anyone could ask for. He was incredibly polite and always a step ahead with his service.   We started with the Calabrian chicken wings and they were cooked perfectly. They are baked and not fried and just as crispy as a fried wing. The Gorgonzola dipping sauce is mouth watering good!! I don't even like stuff like that and I couldn't get enough. The hot sauce served on the side has a kick but nothing crazy.   We ordered a small BTB and a large pepperoni. The crust is awesome! We absolutely loved both pizzas and honestly can't say that one was better than the other. I will say for those that are not a fan of truffle, you barely taste it in some of the bites and not at all in others so don't let the truffle scare you from trying this pizza.   It was a beautiful day and we sat outside. Had a couple of local craft beers to go with our pizza and wings. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

                "description": "Dough is a staple for me. I've been here many times and each visit has been nothing short of enjoyable. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations so to avoid a long wait, this is more of a weekday spot for me. They have a nice outdoor seating area (with heating lamps available if needed) as well as a standard indoor dining area. Perfect for a date night or a girls dinner.   My standard 5-star meal at Dough includes a bottle of red wine, the signature truffle burratta, and their arugula and prosciutto pizza. I'm drooling at the thought. And as I type this review, I ask myself, why do I try to fix something that's not broken? *Sigh.*  During my most recent visit, I decided to be be spontaneous and try something new: the prosciutto sugo pizza. I strayed from my tried and true arugula prosciutto and immediately regretted it upon my first bite. The prosciutto sugo tasted like a sausage and pepper sandwich which, while may be tasty in other circumstances, isn't what I ordered. I was really hoping that the fontina, prosciutto, and mushrooms would compliment the sausage and peppers nicely. Alas, the overload of sausage and peppers steamrolled the itty bitty amount of prosciutto and mushrooms that were provided. My friend and I didn't finish the pizza, and she insisted I keep the leftovers... that's how you know. Minus one star for Dough, but minus 5 stars for myself for straying from my usual. Lesson learned."

Lines of people, rows of vehicles with people inside, etc so when it was our turn it was just a rush of adrenaline, coming from NYC and excited about trying different pizzas.  Needless to say, the ingredients were very fresh that I felt good after I ate the food. It digested quickly and I had no greasy yucky feeling afterwards. We started off with the fresh mozerella appetizer that was to die for. The tomatoes and the bread served with that dish was the perfect sweet and salty.   A must try and we will return next week to try a different pizza for sure. Thanks for the experience!"

Their antipasto platter is cute and can allow you to make a nice charcuterie board. The tuscan salad was nice for a side of greens but nothing amazing. Their Burrata Tre Colore, which I've gotten a few times, is incredible and absolutely worth trying out. The pizza we got recently was the Sausage and Heirloom Cherry Tomato Pizza. It has a good flavor profile with the right amount of meat. As someone who has been to Naples before do I feel like it is authentic? Maybe not. But it is definitely tasty!   Positives: Cute atmosphere, during non-COVID times can watch the chefs at work, great burrata, nice food for a fancy evening  Negatives: Expensive for what you get"

                "description": "Been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks because it's just that good! Also, the service is 5 stars!  Since my partner and i started going, we've been treated with the best service especially from our recent waitress, Jackie!  She was very attentive, gave us refills throughout the service, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  Recently, I had their new avocado chicken sandwich which was amazing! It's a little messy, but has so much flavor. My partner always orders the boneless wings with a side of their truffle fries (which are also amazing!). We've also had their house margarita which is mixed with a very nice balance. Not too strong but also not too light, it's just right. Lastly, one of my favorite sides is the mac and cheese. It's so fresh, and full of flavor.   Overall, the establishment is very clean, and we haven't had to wait the times we've there. We always get seated very quickly! 10/10 recommend."

                "description": "It was a bit of a slow start but their recovery was spot on. Yard House is one of those places you can usually count on for a solid experience. After a few stumbles, the wings were crispy and hot and at the end of the day that's all I wanted.  I don't come to this location often anymore. The service is unapologetically and consistently slow and honestly unfriendly at the bar. That bothers me. Everyone's allowed an off day but there was a span in 2021 where they just couldn't get it together. I walk in every restaurant making my vibe clear \"I'm happy, I'm hungry and I'm ready to go with the flow\" but they just aren't very personable so I just quit going. I'll probably give them another try one day soon. Hopefully I can upgrade this review because it's bumming me out. Ironically, that's why I stopped going to this Yardhouse ....... they were too."

                "description": "After having an extensive tour of UTSA for my daughter the senior, we opted to have a casual meal at the Rim! The restaurant was packed, but we were seated by the bar in a reasonable time. The dining room was loud but was filled with patrons enjoying the music and the games on TV.        Our party of 6 ordered club sandwiches, salads and edamame. My daughter's double decker BLT was savory. My wife's salad was filled with various vegetables and was very good. My turkey club was flavorful but had soggy bread. The bread should have been toasted to help keep the integrity of the sandwich.  Otherwise, the meal was appropriate for the atmosphere and was quite filling and flavorful.       Ultimately, this establishment is casual, fun and worthy of a visit when you are by UTSA!"

The weather was a bit rainy but we enjoyed sitting outside on the patio where there is an amazing view to people watch and look at the game on tv.  There is something for everyone here and I mean everyone: pescatarian, meat eaters, pizza lovers, vegetarians, vegans, beer lovers... the menu is huge!  I ordered the blackened tuna sashimi and the garlic noodle appetizers as dinner. My husband ordered the fish sandwich. What was advertised vs what was presented was spot on. Presentation, taste, wait time all perfect.   Check out the salted watermelon margarita watermelon  and the smoky old fashioned! Delicious and unique.  Great weekday dinner experience."

We tried the Nashville Hot Chicken and the new Korean Sandwich. These are a MUST try. The Nashville chicken is crispy, well prepared, and not overwhelmingly hot. The korean sandwich had an amazing tasting bread and some pretty good beef. I enjoyed every bit. The chicken lettuce wrap appetizer is a must try also, although I felt it was kind of on my small side for the price."

                "description": "Came here on a Monday night and sat at the bar. It was super busy for a Monday, but understandable during the holidays. Service was wonderful even though the bar staff were slammed. Everyone was super attentive and working hard so I really hope their management recognizes that work ethic. They also really know their beers. Super informative and helpful with the suggestions. We ordered the House IPA, Liquid Compass and Belgian White - all delicious! We also ordered the Firecracker Shrimp which came on this deep fried rice cake and it was soooo damn good. Like way better than I expected. It was like bang bang shrimp but with a cajun flavor but not too much cajun, idk, just order it. For entrees we got the Poke Nachos (over rice, per our server's suggestion) with the chips on the side and Spicy Jambalaya. Both were so, so good! The Poke Nachos were spicier than the Jambalaya, to me. It's probably the Serrano peppers but either way, delicious."

That margarita was indeed \"magical\" as it changes colors!   We ordered the onion tower for an appetizer and it was hot and crunchy and came with 2 sauces. Everything was delicious! I got a BBQ chicken pizza and my friends got wings. We came for happy hour so select appetizers and pizzas were half off and drinks were $2 off!   We had a great time and i would definitely recommend coming here for a night out with friends or a lil date!"

The taste is still great, the Korean beef appetizer is enough for a full meal, it's so good! The Korean tacos with vampire cheese tortilla was pretty tasty.. I enjoy the flavors of everything and the ambiance is real chill and we will definitely continue coming... I'll just ask for extra pokÃ¨ on the side for my nachos"

                "description": "Last weekend, my sister, nieces and I decided to stroll the streets of La Cantera and met up with a friend at the Yard House.  We were longing for a cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory, but refused to wait 2 hours for it.  My sister added our names to the Yard House waiting list and I snuck past the hostess and a line at the Cheesecake and walked my nieces to the dessert window.    We eyed the glass window and peeped at the colorful, fruity, Chocolate and Carmel renditions and lime creations of cheesecake, but eventually choose the 1650 calorie Oreo Cheesecake... Yep that's right I said 1650 (YOLO). The girls were excited with our selection and we strolled past the long line of Cheesecake Goers and were called into the Yard House within 10 minutes.   Paul (AKA Pablo) was our waiter. He explained the menu and brought the nieces some crayons and kiddie menus.  Once the little ones were taken care of, he focused his attention on taking care of us.  Within minutes our table had strawberry lemonade and water and orders into the kitchen. The place was packed, but the staff had Social Distancing in mind. Servers wore mask and I saw sanitary actions between guests. For our dining experience, we ordered the Fish and Chips, the Mac and cheese for the kiddos and the Hot Chicken with sweet potato pancakes.   The atmosphere was festive and the foodies seemed to be enjoying a beautiful day out at the mall. The managers at the Hostess station had on their game faces and kept the flow of foodies orderly and expedited. Or food was amazing and Paul kept the dishes cleared and the glasses full.  He didn't mind when the girls cracked open the cheesecake and kept us as his first concern. I would highly recommend the Fish and Chips as the Cod was fried to perfection. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and the cheesecake was a perfect end to our meal.  Even with COVID-19 still an issue, I felt safe, enjoyed my meal and appreciated the outing with the family.  Highly recommended ~ Ms. Foodie Aka Da Islandgal29412"

I just ordered the Magic Margarita and not that it came out wrong, but it's just not my cup of tea. I'm going through a bourbon cocktail mood right now so that was just a bad call on my part.   Our bar snacks came out warm and delicious. The pretzel was warm and soft, so we didn't have to fight it. The calamari was a little over cooked but still good to munch on."

The outdoor sitting seems like more popular for group of people (more than 5) The interior design it's like retro with lots of arts.   Service: The service was fine, our waiter was nice and helpful but the food service, I think we waited so much like almost an hour. The plate is warm but not much of the food. We felt they forgot that the plate was sitting there getting warm.   Food: We ordered a lot of good food that some of it didn't had time to take a pic. For appetizer we had their, firecracker shrimp, four cheese spinach dip and fried calamari. For the main course we had spicy jambalaya, 20 oz Bone-in rib eye and mac + cheese.   We didn't really go wrong with our food everything was so tasty. The Spicy Jambalaya was not really spicy but it was full of seafood!   The experience was great and for sure we would love to go back."

Food, drinks and if you finish eating around 9. The fireworks at Fiesta Texas are icing on the cake. I really recommend the French dip sandwich. If you want a healthier option the tuna crunch salad is amazing. Their cheese curds and garlic truffle fries are great sides to compliment your meals. The kids love them as well. If you are into drinking beer they have more than enough. The selection isa huge. I get one but have to get in the half yard. You know to feel like a BOSS. But service has always been great. Like I said this is the place to be. So don't waste time on places to eat and head their way. You won't be disappointed."

When walking in the door guy rushed to the door to welcome us in. (Don't know where he came from.) The seating was very spread out which was great. However, the only place we were recommended to sit, because no other seating was available inside, was by the corner of the DJ booth. The place seemed geared towards a young demographic (not that I'm ancient), it wasn't what I was expecting.   The service was great! The guy that took are order was very friendly, and attentive to what we wanted. The music was good but I could not hear my friend who was sitting right next to me. I had to lean into her ear so we could \"talk.\" The beer on draft was good. The chips and queso order wasn't great- the c was very watery. Again, not what I was expecting.  If you are looking for a place to listen to music and not the company you're with this is the spot for you. Definitely, not what we were looking for."

One of their partners/managers/ employees (he didn't identify his position) reached out to me on my FB foodie page and left a defensive and dismissive comment.   They doubled down and called me a liar by stating i left untrue and invalid accounts of my visit and tried to insult me by stating I'm no Anthony Bourdain (there was only one, may he rest in peace).   Had they been cordial, apologized for the less than great experience, and invited me to return (without compensation, I'm not looking for anything free) then I would of praised them for reaching out and considered returning to give them another chance."

Ghetto doesn't capture what this place has become since opening. It can't decide what it wants to be! Are you a pizza spot? A bar? A dance club? What happened to the second floor? It's never open. Skip it. They aren't even trying anymore. Head to The Block down the road or Chicken n Pickle 10 minutes away. In case you were wondering the food isn't great either.

                "description": "This place has a promising veneer, but beneath the surface there is a total lack of professionalism. I have given it plenty of chances, because the drinks were priced fair enough and the atmosphere was generally clean with some unique qualities like lots of TVs and a rooftop patio, but every time I've gone to Sandbox the customer service has only gone downhill. Saturday (16 Nov 2019) I sat at a table to join friends. When I arrived my table was already visibly frustrated. Not sure as to why, I shrugged it off while I waited to order a drink. But I waited and waited and WAITED until I had to flag down our server. And I had to do this EVERY time I needed something. Apparently this total lack of attention was happening before I got there, and to make it worse our server seemed annoyed when we kept asking to order stuff. So, when we couldn't get good help from her, we went to the bar: Behind the rounded tile bar there are plenty of bartenders, enough to take care of every approaching patron, but not so shocking at this point, the staff had this bad habit of focusing on each other and not so much on us, the customers. I had to wait multiple times for bar and staff members to finish their conversations before they acknowledged me (or anyone else trying to give them money in exchange for goods or service). And to make it worse: no shame, no sorry, just a \"oh hey bro, whats up?\" All that being said, they could have still got 2 or 3 stars out of me, I'm always generous and forgiving on Yelp. I'm aware this is a college bar with college staff, but one incident Saturday proved they do not care nearly enough: While sitting at my table (surely waiting on our disappearing server), WATER STARTED FALLING ON MY BACK. Now things happen, and I understand this couldn't be predicted, but when we alerted staff that the ceileing was leaking, NO ONE REACTED beyond \"oh, ok.\" My friends and I had to move our table. I had to find a new chair to replace my drenched chair. NO APOLOGIES. NOTHING. Only a yellow sign appeared followed by more bad service. I had to wait AT LEAST twice as long as is typically acceptable for service. I left AT LEAST twice as early as I normally do when attending a bar on a Saturday night. I would guess that Sandbox missed out on AT LEAST half of what I could have added to their revenue stream. I don't see myself going back anytime soon."

Seems small and sparse since it's in a small strip center but seems spacious and inviting inside.   While it's not a big space, the white subway tile, the white button tile bar and the height make it feel big. All this plus the intoxicating smell of the wood burning oven.  Wide selection of draft beer, decent sized menu, ample liquor selection and the obligatory frozen mixed concoctions for the college folks. We asked about happy hour and were fine with the answer but not blown away by the offering. Just ok.   We ordered some beer and nachos and were very pleased with the size, flavor, and variety of items on the nachos. Really good chili and jalapeÃ±o. No complaints here!  Again, while not a big space, the TVs were everywhere and tuned in to the group.  Understand there is a roof top bar to enjoy and have viewed the pictures although today was a little cool to enjoy.   Overall- a GREAT experience! We will return!"

                "description": "While a seemingly popular destination, I've never actually stepped foot into this bar. I walk by often. I notice the neon blue signage when I wait for an Uber. I have had many fleeting conversations with the legends of Southtown on the patio space. Sadly, I cannot tell you about the drinks, the service, or if they are pet-friendly. I can guess that it's packed on First Friday with art enthusiasts, and despite other reviews, I'm sure the bartender has flair.  Joe's is significant to me all the same.   -  I'm moving to New York City, and \"Review Joe's\" is scribbled on my to-do list among selling all my shit and squeezing in a breakfast taco tour.  Almost a year ago, I met this man through a good friend. Tall, charismatic, polyglot, likeable, a real man of the people. He has this swoopy politician hair that hides beneath an obnoxious hat he's collected somewhere along the way. He speaks in excessive idioms and with conviction like it's written in the damn Constitution. He's worldly - it shows. His everyday canvas footwear has seen better days, but his two cell phones suggest importance and a stacked calendar. He's overflowing with ideas and vision and has the most contagious smile I've ever seen; the kind that makes you completely weak in the knees.  We were friends, who became more than friends, stemming from a shared love for drive-thru cuisine.  His sense of humor is a remix of dry British humour and run of the mill mean girl. Strong notes of sarcasm and self-deprecation with a deadpan delivery. I'd love to meet his childhood English tutor.  One of his first jokes I danced with was \"the review.\" In the spirit of open and honest communication, he chuckled about installing a sexy touchscreen on the wall of his loft to include an emoji survey for data collection, similar to those you find outside airport restrooms. How was your overall experience, Aaleen? Smile, Neutral, Frown.  A handful of tangents later, it evolved to a rideshare innuendo. \"Do I get five stars?\" As a seasoned critic in my thirties, I must consider the stunning orange explosion beating through your windows each morning. However, no signs of coffee. Surely, that will influence my lover's rating.  In an attempt to poke fun at the absurdity of life and dating culture as we know it, he claimed his previous romantic encounters wrote their reviews hidden in plain sight on the Yelp page for the bar downstairs; he lived above Joe's. As such, I was mildly disappointed to find that no one has taken the time to submit their review - trust me, I looked.  Well, here we are: 5 Stars. I don't know what the future holds for this establishment, but I can confidently say my experience has been otherworldly. You are my favorite reminder that life should be lived vibrantly, and to me you are magic. I hope you always feel loved."

It was far more sports bar than lounge.  The bartender was standing outside smoking when we arrived and gave us the kind of look that said \"Damn, guess I have to go to work.\"  I'm not sure I'd call him rude, but he was indifferent--no smile, no chatting, just efficiency.  I asked him a question about food delivered from the brewpub next door and got a grunted answer, which pretty much summed up the bartender's demeanor.  The thing that really turned me off is that at one point he sneezed and he didn't even try to cover his nose and mouth--just sneezed right at the glasses and bottles on the back bar.  With many better options in King William and downtown San Antonio, Joe Blue's will not be on my list for a return visit."

It couldn't have been because he was slammed, more like he just didn't want to be there.   Besides that, it's definitely a beer-drinkers haven with quite a selection. I wish they had at least one cider to go along with all the beers they offer.   With friendlier service and better drink options at La Tuna, 1919, Stella, and Halcyon all in walking distance, it's not my first choice. Unless I have friends playing there, then I'm all in."

We wanted to hear the jukebox but he told us no, we wanted to change one TV to a different game, he told us no.    The beer was warm, awful environment. Wait for this place to go out of business and hopefully something better moves in.   Oh the bartender was a dick."

                "description": "I like to think of Joe Blues as my little secret.  Though it gets pretty crowded pretty quick on weekend night by those who know its whereabouts, this is a fairly intimate bar tucked unassumingly away behind Blue Star Brewery in the Blue Star Arts Complex.    The bar serves a full lineup of specialty martinis and cocktails. They keep a few beers on tap, including Stella Artois (a favorite of mine) and its always frigid; and a full selection of bottles and cans are available as well as a small but delicious selection of wines.   Patrons of Joe Blues are as varied as the alcohol on tap.  A young hipster crowd mingles with a more swanky uptown crowd and everyone in between seem to roll in and out seamlessly.  I like spots like this were people are just cool and respect each other and bask in their differences.   The last time I was in, Joe Blues had installed a jukebox.  The selections are a bit pricey in my opinion, but there were lots of songs to choose from and everyone in the bar seemed to enjoy taking turns making picks.  It was a good ice breaker.   The bar is small and gets smokey quick so if you're not into secondhand smoke inhalation venture out and sit on the patio and people watch everyone around Blue Star.  Tons of fun had when you venture off the beaten bath!"

Yeah, the beer is gonna be a bit pricey (for the area), so I had no major complaints there. The restroom was kinda hard to find (you would know what I was talking about if you've been there). I guess the thing I didn't like was the parking situation. it was really hard to find decent parking."

                "description": "Before we get into anything else... what a jukebox!! We spent half an hour putting money in the machine and just picking gorgeous songs (Mumford and sons FTW). Small, or intimate as you prefer, with nice clean lines and enough move around space for folks to belly up or sit at a table as they like.  Though there was only one bartender on staff, he was incredibly nice. Knowledgeable about the beer selection, which is fabulous and even trying to make the karaoke machine work on the big screen so we could fulfill all of our Celine Dion dreams. Being more of a liquor girl myself, I absolutely appreciated the heavy handed pours. El Rufuso especially liked the white Christmas tree, judging by his romp through the branches.   It was too cold but there's a sweet patio as well. If you're in the area and down for a brew, Blue Star is a great stop... but Joe Blues is where you should end your night."

But I won't do that. What would be the point, really.   Besides, it's much more fun to talk about what Joe Blue's is - a typically late night stopover for the gang from Blue Star (and whoever else may be chatting each other up that day) - there's a solid brew selection present, even a little quirk in that regard, and they remember you (well, they often remember me, but that's probably 'cause I tend to make my way in when Krys directs, and when you're with folks in the know, that doesn't hurt).   You'll occasionally find live music, but you'll often find good cheer. And that's worth a little something, too, I'd say."

                "description": "Driving home after some business in the downtown area I hit some construction on Broadway that had detours that led me to Alamo Street and area I had never noticed before. I saw a couple of beer joints and then I noticed La Roca Cantina so I decided to wait out traffic and stop in for happy hour.  The place wasn't packed and so I got a spot at the bar. The inside has a U-shaped long bar you can post up at or several tables and sofas you can sit at in a separate room across the bar. It has more of a cocktail bar vibe than a beer joint and that is what I was looking for.  The bartender, Roel, asked what I would like so I started off with my go to, a Bulleit Rye Old fashion.  I watched Roel make it and he made it just the way I like it, test one passed.  As a follow-up, I asked if he could make a Sazerac, and he said yes, then asked what type of Rye I would prefer. I like when I'm given the option so after looking at their selection I went with a Rittenhouse Rye.  When it was served, it looked the part then after a sip, it tasted the part; test two passed.  Roel came over to ask if I liked the drinks and I gave him a thumbs up. He chatted with us for a while and made sure we were taken care of so he gets a thumbs up as well.  Overall, this is a nice off the beaten path cocktail bar that I want to come check out one weekend, Covid permitting."

She made such good drinks that weren't on the menu and that was appreciated.I give Antonia 5 stars but the establishment and the experience at the end gets an overall 2.   I came here on a Thursday night with a few friends and enjoyed some drinks. Its a 360 bar which is nice because there are lots of seats around the bar. Beyond that they have some couches around that you are able to sit at if you'd like. When I'm at a cocktail bar I like to watch the drinks made so I prefer to sit at the bar when there's availability. I love cocktails with egg whites in them so I requested that from the bartender and she made me a few after asking the types of flavors I like. The music was cool and the vibe was low key except for some loud patrons across the bar.   Towards the end of the night it was getting close to closing and a short man who came out of nowhere. We hadn't seen him once all night.He told us that we had 3 minutes to drink your drinks. Then he repeatedly told us every 30 seconds how much time we had left.This was extremely obnoxious and ridiculous to say the very least. He was only doing this to myself and my group of friends, there were a total of three of us.  The bar was still full of about 10 other people not including the staff.So this was uncalled for to say the very least. I understand last call but there are ways to do that and you should treat everybody with respect.   We were paying customers who had spent a decent amount of money and tip very well. I don't appreciate being treated this way. When we were leaving and the bar was STILL full of people this guy changed his tune and was trying to shake our hands and thank us for coming.   My review would have been more starts if it wasn't for this guy. I'm not sure what this mans role was in the bar but he should learn how to treat people with respect and not be rude. The next time I'm in San Antonio I will not be coming back here."

The security at the door said they were at capacity and it was gonna be about a 10-15 wait. We said it's okay we can wait. While we were waiting a group of 6 people arrive and the security tell them to wait behind us, another group of 7 people come and he tells him the same.  A waiter comes outside and says I can take in 6 people, I'm ready to go inside but the people behind my boyfriend and I yell we are 6. And the security let's them in. I tell the security why he did that and he said sorry I have no control over who goes in. At this point I'm upset. So I call my friends inside and tell them what happened, they said they have to get their waiter and give them money so they can let us in. I said okay so we wait, 20 min have gone by and the same waiter comes outside and lets his friend come in with a group of 7 people, skipping us again. This time around I'm LIVID! The security at the door makes a comment saying\" if it gets to 1:30 am I would just leave if I was y'all\" that made me even more upset. I called my friends inside and told them I was leaving, my friends said we were next but there was nobody else in the line.  They have VERY VERY POOR MANAGEMENT as well as a CLOWN as their security. How are you gonna tell me your at capacity when you just let 13 people in before me?!?! I should have called SAPD to check their establishment if that was the case because they were VIOLATING COVID restrictions.   If you don't know the security, a waiter, or a bartender, SONT BORHER TO GO TO THIS PLACE."

A middle aged (50s) caucasian security guard ranted for 20 minutes about how they were breaking TABC law by letting 80 people into the bar over capacity limits.   This middle aged (mid 50s) caucasian security guard proceeded to let two large groups of 10+ people into the club through the side door.... after a little persuading (a cash tip).  Three guys got fed up of waiting as this middle aged caucasian security guard let in the large groups beyond capacity ahead of the line. When the bar closed this middle aged security guard started handing out life time bans. Apparently the middle aged security guard has an ownership stake in the bar and is able to make business decisions.  Ultimately I give this bar 2 huge thumbs down . When security is taking cash tips and breaking TABC capacity regulations... but handing out lifetime bans to patrons who wait in line but get cut because they are unable to profit the security... something business wise needs to be re-evaluated."

They've got some great happy hour prices that include $5 cucumber martinis and old fashioned options on there. You can't beat those prices and the drinks are good! Happy hour is typically open until 9. These are the 2 drinks my husband and I prefer and they were good enough we'd definitely come back.   They've also got live music on Friday and Saturday nights...I believe that starts at 10."

This is the place to be, its dim settings, fireplace, love seating, and drinks make it all the right settings for that excellent night ;)  The drinks, my my, isn't this what you were looking for? These fine artistic mixologist will make you that perfect cocktail.  Not sure what to order? Go ahead ask, For you shy folks, I would recommend a Cucumber or Strawberry Martini for those seeking out something sweeter.  It's a favorite and well known concoction by many who are fans of this bar.    Somewhere this cool isn't quite what I consider a dive bar, in fact, Friday and Saturday nights, you might even find many whom come up dressed up! It's a place where many professionals come to meet and loosen up.  So don't be shy to come in dressed nicely. I would recommend it, as I come in dressed to impress all the time!  Lastly, the drink prices themselves. Don't worry, its quite affordable compared to nearby cocktail lounges.  As I said, its a place where you and your date can enjoy yourselves without having to worry about cost, venue, or drinks. See you there!"

I really wish we'd had more of a crowd here since the seating in the back is straight up boss, but those of us who were in town early chilled at the bar and ended up Uberrushing some Tuckers (omg, so delicious) while I sipped on my old fashioned.  Now again, I almost wish this had been a night event because my drink was hard poured like a motha and that early in a YSB and after flying so many hours I just have not yet built up my tolerance to drink it that stiff. Light weight problems, amiright?  I'm so thankful Mike introduced us to this bar! The bartenders and their play list were awesome and we had a great time! A big thank you to La Roca for having us! Viva la YSB!"

                "description": "So, let me tell you how amazing the bartenders here are.   I came here on Saturday night. It was still lively with tons of people, and the bartender, Antonia,  rocked the crap out of that shift. She's how you would hope every bartender could give service on a busy Saturday night.   Then, I stopped in here on a Tuesday night, and I was privileged to see this place truly shine. Antonia makes beautiful drinks. She made the refreshingly sweet \"Walk of Shame\" and Cucumber Martini, which has a slight pucker yet smoothe finish.  Then, the uber talented and passionate Keith walks in and makes this beautiful pineapple tiki drink that (literally) transports you to a tropical paradise with one sip. We, then, took daiquiri shots in honor of San Antonio legend bartender Sasha Petraski.  Needless to say I had to take an uber home, but the passion, talent, and friendliness of both Antonia and Keith will definitely bring me back.   If you're looking for delicious craft cocktails and friendly-chill environment, I highly recommend La Rocca Cantina."

This place is just a win all the way around. I wasn't 100% sure what La Roca was going to be like walking in. I saw an article in The Current talking about a Mexican style lounge, but what is that? Apparently it is a gorgeous bar, a huge space with sofas and lounge chairs, TVs, and probably a lot more stuff that I haven't found yet. Stop in for Happy Hour, it runs til 9pm most nights. Kick back on a sofa or sit at the bar and chat with whoever is working, you can't go wrong either way."

During these times only 10 customers allowed at a time and mask is required.   They sell toilet paper here and some produce. They have some cheeses and wines as well. This is a fine grocery place so the goods are pricey and boujee. They have outside seating which is nice and it was not crowded at all. We took some lunch and bought coffee from here and ate in their patio pavilion."

The bread was light and fluffy, not sure if it was pretzel or what but it was really good and I am NOT a bread person.  The eggs and cheese were, well eggs and cheese not much you can do with that, but the bacon was the thicker bacon and was super yummy; 9 dollars, not bad for the Pearl."

They serve all sorts of coffee as well, and you can pick up high-end culinary creations ( different types of quinoa salads or vegetable medley in different seasonings and sauces). I really wish they would pretty on their menu a charcuterie board, as they have a plethora of cheese and meat options for purchase separately. I ended up buying a container of artichoke hearts and olives in a olive oil dressing to enjoy with some beverages. Had my companion been hungrier, I would have also purchased some brie or other soft cheese and crackers , and possibly salami.  I was very happy with their hours of operation as they were open before most anything in the Pearl Brewery plaza. Terrific place!"

The staff is pretty friendly and it also doubles as a small convenience store (albeit more expensive than your local Valero).  Their lemonade is perfect for a hot day, and the sandwich was super filling. I only managed to eat half before taking the rest home. And the thing I was most excited to eat later? This MASSIVE fudgy brownie. It was one of those perfect brownies that reminded me of a gourmet Little Debbie brownie. Dense. Fudgy. In need of a cigarette and a nap afterward.  Coffee shops are not a revolutionary idea, especially when you're traipsing about at The Pearl. But out of towners (or even staycationers) staying at Hotel Emma can't go wrong picking up a fine brew and treat at Larder."

The cozy space offers two narrow stories of wines, Texas honeys, desserts, pre-made salads, fresh local juices and more.   Fun fact: this is the first hotel in Texas to boast an in-house journey market (they even sell pre-made picnics!). The fun thing about this location is that it's wedged equidistant between several of the key San Antonio attractions like the Japanese Gardens, Grotto, Alamo and Breckinridge Park. One more note about the in-house market-- it's the old fermenting cellar of Pearl Brewery. DO NOT leave Larder without popping your head into the Hotel Emma lobby. Bring your camera and enjoy."

Greg was so awesome and fun to talk to while we were there. They have growlers and crowlers you can get filled, as well as bring in your own growler for a fill. The inside is dog-friendly.  My only meh about this place is that there are 3-4 taps with Guadalupe Brewing's beer. Don't get my wrong, I love them, but they are right down the road, so to me it doesn't make sense to have that many of theirs on tap, especially since my husband and I frequent local breweries.  Can't wait to see what else they bring in and are excited to go back!"

The young lady behind the bar was awesome and you could tell she loved working there. Nice selection of beer and a fun environment definitely says I'll return for more visits. If you are in New Braunfels definitely stop by and check them out. First Beer is Melted Snowman Winter Ale by @whitestone_brewery and second beer is Battle of Hops by @viva_brewery"

The bartender happened to be the one who invited the drink, King Ghidorah. We both enjoyed our drinks.  Definitely a good stop, now that I know where it's located."

Beautiful bar, friendly service, nice outdoor seating area for people watching :)  We ordered a drink that was supposed to be jalapeno driven but didn't taste it at all, which was a bit curious. By mistake, they had also made us a jalapeno tequila drink, which they gave us as a courtesy. As we finished our cocktail, we tried the shot and this tasted exactly as I had hoped our drink would. For our 2nd round, I went to the bartender who had made our shots and asked him to re-create this in the form of a cocktail. Success!! HH drinks are very reasonably priced $6-9. Not quite sure what happened with our 1st round?? Normally, I'd expect the establishment to rectify the situation but they had given us free shots."

The bar is large with a huge (and clear) projector that was playing MLB when we went. There seems to be an upstairs with another bar, most likely for the crowded weekends.  There is a large patio outside with shade and nice lighting. A plus- the women's restroom is very clean and smells very nice! Win!"

Guess they are either hurting for money so much they need to steal dollar on dollar or are running a bigger scheme...who knows. Anyway, 2 minutes later the manager tried to say we were \"somewhere before there\" and kicked us out (lol) for asking why we were charged $1 more per drink!!! LOL!!!!

This is where it gets good....as we walk up to the door the bouncer a huge African American man proceeds to tell us that it's not a entrance and points to the line...my friend rebuttals that she's noticing people walk in through this entrance if we can be let in as it's cold outside. His response....wait for it...$80 gets you in through this door. I was at a loss for words we say no thank you and as we walk away he yells $50! I'm sorry but Blue Box has lost our business. I believe as guest we should not be extorted to pay such a egregious price to be let in.....maybe management should consider increasing the bouncer pay where they won't feel the need to extort guest to give them money to step inside the establishment."

It's loud, hoppin, and has multiple TV's for sports, fights, etc. Outside, there are interactive games, big fans for hot days, and warming fires/heaters for cool nights.   We decided to bring our son here to celebrate a week after his 21st birthday. We understand that the place is strictly 21 and up but it seemed overkill that he was carded when we entered the building, carded by two employees while we were looking for a table, and carded by two more servers as we sat at a table. We laughed about it but it seemed a bit unorganized.  The drinks were great! We ordered a few different mixed drinks followed by beer and seltzers. The food, however was disappointing. We heard great things about some appetizers they have on the menu so we ordered a few. The Clothesline Bacon, the fried Mac-N-Cheese, and the pretzel with queso (and some sort of marmalade but I'm not sure the flavor). Honestly, we didn't really like any of the food :( The bacon was chewy, thick, and had a strange taste and the Mac-N-Cheese bites were extremely greasy and flavorless. The pretzel was okay but a bit dry. We loved all the drinks and the fun atmosphere so we'll definitely be back -but we'll eat before we come next time."

We have always enjoyed our service (and food) until today.   13 groups of people in 50+ group setting. 5 servers standing around laughing and huddling. Our server Ali was MIA most all of our visit. Ask for Tabasco 3 times before in was provided with no apologies. Ali left with no information about who would take over. Saw her leave to the parking lot and left wondering.  This didn't appear to be an urgent need to leave as her and 3-4 other servicers reviewed tabs etc before she disappeared. A simple ' I'm leaving and this is who will be taking over' would have sufficed.  I'm frustrated with the experience. The food today is terrific as always. Service today is subpar. Very sad."

                "description": "I came here for the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. I heard good things. I also ordered the basket of onion rings. The rings were bulky and fresh and very tasty and crunchy. The Nashville chicken sandwich was excellent. Just the right blend of sweetness and heat. My advice is ask for the cole slaw on the side. The Texas toast gets soaked on one side with the juice from the cole slaw. The drinks are served in unconventional bar ware but it works. For example my old fashioned was in the glass pictured below. Stay away from the house margarita drinks as they are tiny in size. I also advise avoiding during Cowboys football games. That is unless you're one of the fans of Cowboys.  Bartender seemed overworked so bring your patience. She'll eventually get to taking your order."

                "description": "I was in town for a family emergency and wanted to get away for a little while to have dinner and cocktails. My sister suggested Lucy Cooper's because she loves their food and outdoor patio is a bonus to her.  We shared the Boss Hogg, Krack fries, Mac and cheese, and I had the Honey Suckle Sangria Popsicle Margarita. Everything was so delicious! The Boss Hogg was loaded with pulled pork, smoked ham, applewood bacon, and smokey sausage, and smothered with Coca-Cola bbq sauce. Yum! We split it because it was too big for one person and we wanted to try a couple of sides. The fries were delicious. I looked on their menu and couldn't find their Mac and cheese but it was so, so good. I hope they didn't take it off the menu.   They have a great drink menu and I decided to try the Suckle Sangria Popsicle Margarita, I'm always down to try new drinks. It was great. We ate out on the patio which has a cool vibe with it's fire pits and chilled vibe. The service was great and the food and drinks were brought out in a timely manner.  All in all it is a great place and I will definitely be back to try more of their unique menu items. I love me some Cajun/Southern food and this place did not disappoint!"

Seems like every time I've come drink service is very slow. I would also order more food if there were more traditional bar foods. It gets a four because of the fun times I've had here. Great place to chill and don't miss out on the naught bingo on Wednesday's."

I came in for happy hour on a Friday and it was packed (COVID rules applying of course and thank you  for that).  We met the manager Alex that evening and he was great!  Helped us out a lot and made our visit wonderful.  He was on top of the seating for customers and meeting with others while he was back and forth.    Destiny was our waitress and she was fabulous and fun.  We Joked with her and she was a good sport with a great attitude.  Friday night happy hour is the best.  I suggest the shrimp boil and bacon clothesline."

I got the Nola barbecue shrimp and my husband got the prime rib. The shrimp was a little too sauced for my taste, and it comes with a biscuit sitting on top. I got the blood Orange cider, tall. I didn't realize how tall that is! The one rib sandwich was good, very generous with the meat, it came with au jus, really good. They have a free stouts on tap, which we appreciate. The service was fast and friendly. There is outdoor seating with misters, but you are on the access road, so, I imagine it's noisy. Cute decor, and several tv screens."

I have dined there three times already and never disappointed with the quality of the food or service. The chef is a genuinely sweet soul you can just tell cares about the food.  So much so, that I decided to order their Thanksgiving dinner package and boy was I NOT disappointed!  The package could easily feed a family of 8 or more and had a choice of ham or turkey; we got the ham. It was a large package that included homemade-style baked macaroni and cheese, green bean casserole, mash potatoes and gravy, dressing with cranberry sauce, rolls, sweet potatoes, and a dessert. Y'all I am Southern, from the backwoods of Mississippi and this meal touched my soul!  I am beyond impressed with the quality and seasoning of the food. The dressing was so moist but not in a mushy way; it was cooked the old fashion way like I had growing up in MS. The mac and cheese was cooked by somebody's grandma I'm sure of it cause it was too good. The rolls are out of this world and I hope I can order them anytime.   I am new here in San Antonio and I don't know if this is something they do every year, but it should and everyone should order at least once; you will not be disappointed.   Thank You Lucy Cooper for making my Thanksgiving amazing, The Patrick and Saunya ODwyer"

There is plenty of space outside to sit (important for folks who are a bit Covid nervous). There are firepits outside for ambiance and warmth. They have music on the weekends. Great location.  All the food is awesome - my favorites are probably the tin can nachos, clothesline bacon, Friday $10 shrimp boil. There are always events on the calendar."

So coming here was not by choice - strictly the only option we had.   I forgot my ID at home and was not aware that you had to be 21 to be on the premises. Not only am I 25 years old, I am with my entire family and PARENTS that are validating my age.   The management told me I had to prove my age and if I had a photo of my ID that would work. Sure enough I had a photo and guess what, they said \"it could be fake\" so no it didn't work. SO WHY EVEN STATE THAT?  I'll admit I don't look my age, but still this is ridiculous. Then they stated if I had a photo of my birth certificate that would work and guess what again? Nope - could be fake even though I had a photo it.   These people are freaking ridiculous - not worth my money. If a cop accepts a photo copy of my ID and insurance a damn bar can too."

Friday night is $10 Shrimp Boil night, but expect a crowd, especially on the patio, not for the shrimp, just for the atmosphere. COVID precautions are set in place, and they do implement the rules. If you are even just standing near your table, they will ask you put your mask on. Oh, and the shrimp boil is offered daily, its just on special on Friday nights. And they have changed up their seasoning a little bit. YUM!  We stopped in on a Wednesday night to meet some friends for dinner on the patio, not realizing it was Naughty Bingo Night. What fun we had! OMG! The host is hilarious. It is $2 for the bingo dauber, since COVID, you keep your own, but you can bring it back the next Wednesday, and play for free! The prizes are novelty prizes. None of us won, but we had a great time playing along.   Husband and I shared the Hawaiian flat bread pizza, topped with a coca cola bbq sauce, which was a nice added touch of flavor. The Clothesline Bacon is one of my absolute favorite things on the menu here. Who doesn't love bacon... and this bacon is out of the world!!   And if you haven't ordered the Tin Can Nachos... do so. Its fun just watching them remove the can and seeing the glorious nacho pile that awaits you!"

My waitress named Lauren was clueless as well. I ordered items on your menu and she was clueless on what your restaurant had to offer. I will never return and will make sure everyone knows why, regretfully the food was actually good. If your restaurant plans to succeed, I suggest hire employee that respect their patronage."

They have the freshest seafood west of the Gulf.  The place has a feel of a neighborhood hangout where everyone knows your name.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  Today when we stopped for dinner, we were celebrating a birthday.  Sarah, our server, was fast, friendly, and fun.  Will probably ask for her next time we stop in.  They have daily \"chalkboard specials\" along with a menu with something for everyone.  I had the scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp. Mom had the bbq salmon tacos.  Both were delicious.  Got the peel and eat shrimp for our appetizer, which come served on crushed ice on a silver platter.   Give it a try!  Well worth the trip."

The real reason for the 5 star is for the margaritas. Get them. My mother picked it up and expecting a basic marg I was hit was this amazing sweetness with just a hint of tang. Get the margarita.   The gf went with the fish tacos which were. Your basic taco but what really made it nice was the soft tortilla they used to WRAP the taco. I know weird but since the tortilla was so good the fish was just a filler."

It gets better, the girl came back in and they gave it to me.  At this point, I'm hungry.  I'm done waiting and the kitchen staff was amazing.  The hostess was nice and attentive.  I only took it because I saw the person who walked back in and the containers are see through.  Not sure what caused the mix up and I left a tip online when I placed my order.  Food sanitation rules mean they throw out the food but I'm rambling and disappointed.  I'll try them out again if this food tastes good."

                "description": "A great place to go if you are looking for seafood! Everything is very well done there. The servers and staff are nice. They also have a quaint outside seating area. It is very cozy in my opinion. In the restaurant, a few of the walls are decorated beautifully in the nautical theme. And then you have another wall that makes it feel like you are on an old ship eating seafood. I enjoy everthing there so far. May daughter orders off menu because she mainly likes butter pasta and grilled shrimp. I am not sure why they do not make that dish there, it is super delish! The fish and chips are awesome there. The fish and batter makes it light and not heavy at all. I have had a few of their house special entrees but I am curious about their specials. It was too late at the time when I ordered, that I saw the mussels dish that looked super interesting!  This place is tucked away near the HEB and across from Zios. If you haven't been, I highly suggest you go."

                "description": "This has been one of our favorites for a while. I just never sat down and wrote a review for them. Reasons we like it: great place, good atmosphere, excellent drinks, awesome food.  It's pretty small on the inside, but they just set up tables and chairs on the outside too which is great. Not sure whether they did that for the pandemic or not, but I really liked that change. This last time we were there, it looked like they were running at 100% occupancy which is good for them. My husband really enjoyed the music which was an 80's metal band feel.   We usually have to wait for a while before we are seated, so we were pleasantly surprised to only have to wait a couple minutes. And it was a Saturday night around 6:30, so prime time.   We ordered our usual drinks and appetizers. My husband likes the jalapeÃ±o margarita, and I like the Tito's lemonade. Mine wasn't as good this time. Didn't seem like there was any alcohol in it. We always order the oyster nachos WHICH IS A MUST! They are literally the best thing there. We even had to order two because my husband wanted more. We also ordered a cup of crab bisque which is also very good.  So this is one of the reasons I did not give 5 stars. The whole reason I went there was to get the crab legs, but they didn't have them! Sooo bummed, you have no idea! So I ended up ordering the scallops that were on the specials board, and my husband got the shrimp tacos. Both pictured and both excellent. One other dish that I didn't see but if they still have it you must try is the cheesy grits. So good too!  At the end, we ordered the bread pudding to go. For some reason I remember reading or hearing that it was the best dessert there. I was wrong. This was the other reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. We did order it to go, so that might have had something to do with it. Maybe if you stay and eat it in the restaurant, it would taste better. I don't know. It was just dry and the sauce wasn't good.  Again, one of our go to's as far as dining out goes. I guess I need to call next time before we decide to make the drive over there to make sure they have the crab legs."

My family and I came here a week ago and were seated immediately. Our server was amazing! She was very attentive to our needs and provided recommendations from the menu. I don't think we had a single complaint about your food; it was delicious and we didn't have to wait too long to get it. Since it's crawfish season, my husband ordered a pound and it was bomb. We finished the whole thing within minutes. Fish and chips were delicious and flavorful. Calamari was also delicious; the two sauces that accompanied it were excellent. Truthfully speaking, I don't have any complaints about this place. It was that good!"

This was my good fortune, as I had a wonderful meal of the scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp served on a bed of mashed potatoes and wilted spinach.  It was perfect in all ways;preparation, taste and size.  I have brought a slice of the key lime pie back to my hotel room for later.  My server was sweet.  The restaurant is casual but charming.  My guess is they do a pretty noisy business on Fridays and Saturdays.  All in all a nice surprise!"

Service has always been friendly, quality of food has met my standards for this laid back seafood grill restaurant.  We moved here 5 years ago from Louisiana and I have to say, this place makes me feel at home.  Food is what you would expect. I love their fishandchips. I honestly crave it once in a while.   I miss their crawfish ettouffe. My husband and I have ate almost all their specialty entrees. Delicious   Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  It's the kind place you can kick back and feel at home.  I've been coming back and will continue.  Honestly, I think it's the one restaurant we've returned more than any other restaurant in San Antonio."

The table was filthy and sticky. The staff should check outside ones in a while, or leave cleaning wipes for the guests."

The Phoenix Saloon has a rich history being registered as a Texas Landmark as well as being on a tour of haunted places! They've kept up that 1800's saloon feel, very cool!  That aside, their menu is delicious. Top shelf \"bar food\". But the must have is their homemade chili and cornbread. It's to freaking die for! But be warned, it comes in three levels of heat. The hottest would tear up the toughest of Texas cowpokes! They also have a full bar with a multitude of craft and domestic beers on draught.  The Phoenix is also well known for their showcase of local music talent. From a laidback guy strumming a guitar on the small stage during the afternoon, to full on rock and country bands on the big stage at night on the weekend. That said, the ONLY drawback is the music (during the afternoon) can be too loud at times. Still, add the Phoenix Saloon to your list to visit (or comeback for another visit!) you won't be disappointed."

Otherwise a great place to go and be seen without getting talked about, unlike at The Faust.  Nice to visit during the day for lunch and a beverage.  Definitely has a nighttime music vibe.  Very loud, be warned, but you can take your drink outside and sit on the patio and people watch.  I'm not a beer drinker, but I'll order a screwdriver.  I go so rarely and am always amazed that the barkeep knows what I drink!  I'll grab a stool and she'll ask if I want \"the usual.\"  Uncanny!  They could add some modern conveniences like purse hooks by the bar stools, but it's no big deal for me.  It actually keeps me from forgetting my purse if it perches on the bar counter.  I love this place so much that I have the urge to go tomorrow!"

                "description": "The Phoenix Saloon is conveniently located just off the main square on the corner of  San Antonio and Casteel with huge windows to look out to the street. I've been here several times over the years since they have opened. It's always a stop on the pub crawls!   What's not to love...  Long bar along the way for all those bar flies to hold up Lots of seating which is also great for groups Huge band stand for those night with live music Food!... how about that history of chili???  The history according to their website: \"Since 1871, our building has been home to various bars and saloons, most famously the original Phoenix Saloon. It was here in 1894 that William Gebhardt, proprietor of the back room cafe, invented chili powder! Prior to this, chilis had only ever been used fresh, but Gebhardt devised a process for crushing and drying them. Gebhardt brand chili products are still widely available today. The original Phoenix Saloon was reputedly the first bar in Texas to offer service to women. No lady who valued her reputation would dare be seen in a saloon, so the proprietor set up a ladies beer garden with bells in the trees for service. There was a deer pen too, and an alligator pit and badger fights. There was even a parrot on a perch just inside the front door that was taught to say, \"Have you paid your bill!?\" in German! Prohibition put an end to the good times at the Phoenix, which closed its doors on June 26, 1918. The Ludwig Building, as it was then known, was expanded and turned into a department store in 1922. In 1935, by now renamed the Schmidt Building, it was remodeled again. The building was home to a number of retail and service businesses until the Phoenix rose from the ashes, so to speak, on March 5, 2010. Like its mythical namesake, the Phoenix Saloon has been reborn! The new owners relish the building's flavorful past. In bringing the new incarnation to life, they've exposed the original 1871 brick wall, salvaged the old Phoenix Saloon beadboard paneling and re-used various old shutters, sinks and lights. Trying to celebrate all aspects of the building, they also constructed the 40-foot-long bar from the old department store cabinetry, flipped a mirror from the old shoe department upside down behind the bar and relocated a three-way dressing room mirror in the ladies restroom.\"  The Phoenix is also to be reported as being haunted... with such history, this shouldn't be a surprise.... Boo!   So go grab a local beer and some Texas Red with Fritos and a burger on the side... it's time to have a good 'ol time in downtown NB!"

                "description": "My wife and stopped in for a late Lunch today.  The restaurant is located near the traffic circle in down town New Braunfels. You can even park on the street for free.  The tables were dirty, so we brushed it off with a napkin. I had to fight the flies during the entire meal.  You can't order at the table. You can see the lady behind the bar. You order at the bar, then go sit at a table.  Our food came. My burger was on a cold, stale bun. The burger was ordered well done, but it came medium well.  The fries were cold. My wife's burger was the same. Her fries were the same.  Sad, because this place could be so much more."

Enjoyed the South African bartender who let us try a couple of the drafts before picking out the right one.  There are a number of choices but I ended up with the Scotch Ale that was perfect.  We then wondered over and played a couple games of checkers.  Perfect afternoon!"

                "description": "Came for the chili and history.  They have 4 heat level chilis. They all start from the same base chili and then peppers are added ranging from jalepenos to ghost chilis. I stopped at habanero. Not blazing but good heat.  The toppings are pricy at $0.75 each for small amounts of onion, cheese, sour cream, etc. it adds up quickly.  The chili flavor is tasty. Large chunks or as they say hunks of browned sirloin (seemed like chuck) are widely dispersed in a thickened chili sauce. I prefer 80% meat with just enough reduced chili stock, theirs is more like 50:50.  Moved on to the blue burger. Menu says stuffed with blue cheese but it is actually mixed in the meat. It was well prepared and tasty.  The atmosphere is super chill and the Night Owls were on stage tonight, I'm impressed! Service is mostly order at the bar.  I'm pretty much a chili snob, I only like my own creation but theirs is pretty good if someone else is making it for you."

I really get it, but if an establishment is going to serve food it might be a good idea to have food servers. Our nephew brought us here for the chili.  If you are hungry for chili this is the place. The chili coke rated in degrees of heat. I understand the draw for the chili. The burger, sandwiches and other items are just standard nothing special. People have to go to the bar to order food and to get drinks. There is no table served except to bring food from the kitchen and someone cleans off the table when people leave.  The live music was....just background noise. I guess it was just open mic night or something. Great selection of beer on tap. Three solid bartenders who seemed to keep the place going. If you are out to drink beer on tap and maybe grab a bite this is okay.  Chili is good."

                "description": "My boyfriend asked me to write this review.  Eeks! Me thinks not. We came here for chili one night. 8/9 or 8/10. When we arrived the blonde bartender was assisting another customer for a hot 5 minutes. When she came over to us we asked to order food and she said the kitchen closed ONE MINUTE BEFORE. But ma'am, we have been standing here for a while... If someone took our order when we arrived, we wouldn't've been in this pickle. The place was not busy (2-3 3 tops max). I understand the kitchen is closed but I'm sure, positive even, that they don't throw out the chili as soon as the second hand hits 12. You could've asked the kitchen to scoop one bowl of chili out in exchange for money, and I bet $100 they would've done it. Why? Because I ask my kitchen guys all the time.   We will not be coming back and my boyfriend would like to speak to management/owners. Thanks."

More contemporary decor, cool looking bar, and well-spaced for social distancing.  Our server was very friendly but service was unreasonably slow. We were almost finished with our chips, salsa and queso by the time our bar drinks made it to the table.  My son really liked his Coco Rita and I really enjoyed the sangria.  However I was almost ready to cancel the drink order due to slow service.  Our table would not recommend the fish tacos. I had the Lisa's special which was great and my daughter liked her puffy tacos.  Clearly the labor shortages is real which impacted our service. That' said I would like to return  because it seems like it might be a better place for happy hour and cocktails."

                "description": "It's not exactly the same animal as the original Rosario's in Southtown, but Rosario's of the north still has a lot to offer. Despite many Tex-Mex eateries in the vicinity, the name here still carries a lot of weight for lunch-goers, tourists, and folks who simply can't resist their queso. (#1) I would probably consider them somewhere around a 3.5 star wise, but rounding up for potential.  This location is pretty convenient for the many locals who don't (ever) feel like venturing toward downtown. One thing that stands out immediately is just how spacious and modern it is compared to its sister location. The decor is on point, with a very free flowing interior, natural lighting all throughout, and excellent ambience. There is also an excellent outdoor space, which makes this venue a versatile one for just about any occasion.  Overall, the food is decent but I've yet to be impressed in the same way as the other location. After multiple visits, I've found the food to be saltier or simply lacking compared to the original spot. That's not to say that there aren't some good choices to be had. The margaritas are definitely killer and they go wonderfully with the griselda's tacos. I still think their fire roasted salsa is some of the best out there and I've enjoyed the pozole from time to time. Their signature queso is still quite good, but I find myself longing for Southtown Rosario's over this one, at least food wise.  The bar / lounge area seems like an ideal spot for happy hour, which I'm pleased to say is excellent for the prices. Even the bathrooms are in tip top shape. Service could probably step it up a bit, but their friendliness outweighs their tendency to be really slow. Whether it's for a date, casual lunch, or a special group outing, Rosario's North is still worth a look.  ________________ (#1) I know I can't be the only one."

We love the food/environment of the downtown location and were super excited to have an option on the North side!  Despite the restaurant being empty when we arrived at 5:00, they would not seat us until all twelve people arrived so those of us who were there had to sit at individual tables.  The hostess was rude and unaccommodating; we couldn't move tables together, sit together, etc.    Once our group was seated together, we asked for one bill and were billed separately and not only were there separate bills, we were overbilled by double the amount we charged.  We called to complain when we received our credit card notices and again, disappointing outcome with lame excuses and \"well that's our policy.\"    Not worth it!!!  Embarrassing for my colleague and I who set up the meeting for them to experience San Antonio hospitality which was obviously lacking at this restaurant!!!  Super disappointing."

The margaritas - not the best, not the worst - glad they were only $6 thanks to Happy Hour (4-7pm Sat). The queso - flavor wise, possibly the blandest queso I've ever had, although the hidden pico helped step it up a bit. That being said, it paired flawlessly with the chicken flautas I ordered, so I have no regrets tacking on an order of Queso Rosario's. My one true fault - I came here with two friends who both ordered the flautas especiales and both of them received food that was visibly burnt. While my food was great, they did not have the same impression. I will also add that our waitress was fabulous! I wish I could remember her name."

                "description": "Having to take a traffic detour I find myself getting hungry so I look over and see the Northern cousin of one of my favorite South Town locations....serendipity! After a quick look over the menu, I decide on something a little out of my norm but it sounded so delicious based on the menu description (Chiles guajillos and pasillas are the foundation of the delicious sauce that tops 3 queso fresco-filled enchiladas. Served with avocado, cabbage lime slaw, and grilled jalapeno pepper. Topped with fried potatoes, carrots, cilantro, and drizzled with crema Fresca) that I had to try it along with a side of island white rice and boracho beans. When the plate comes out you can see this dark, thick sauce covering the enchiladas and smell the spices rising from the dish. As I take my first bite, the sauce and cheese blend so well together and pack a flavor punch to the palette....pow! I dip all the grilled side veggies provided into the sauce and down they go......bye bye! The side of rice and beans just compliment the meal and also blend well with the \"mole\" type sauce.  Overall, this was a pleasant surprise and I look forward to trying more of the menu."

                "description": "Rosario's has two locations, I went to their North restaurant for dinner based on a Google search. While, this has the appearance of an upscale Mexican restaurant, the ambiance is not what I would have expected. The dining experience is very loud due to hard surfaces everywhere. Seating is not any better either with hard metal chairs. There were no booths I could see even though the dining area could certainly handle it. We were sat next to a table with a toddler who would let out a piercing scream occasionally.   Here's what's good about Rosario's. The food is very good. I shared the Fiesta Special (for 2, $28.95) with Beef and Shrimp. The food arrived quickly and sizzling hot. For the price I expected a bit larger platter but, it was still enough to share.   I also ordered a Cadillac Margarita which was very good. All total, the bill came to $52.44, making Rosario's moderately priced.  Our server was very nice, walked us through all the Margarita options but, honestly, some of the versions just didn't sound very appealing.  Who puts Sangria in a Margarita or, Coconut for that matter?  I liked Rosario's North for the food and service, just not for the loud environment and uncomfortable seats."

We were just a party of two .   We sat there for about 10 minutes without our waiter saying anything to us.  Another staff member walked over and asked me if I ordered a beer? I said no but, if you could find my waiter I'd love a glass of water.   A gentleman comes over with two glasses and says he's our waiter.  We finally have drinks. We know exactly what we want so we place our order.  My daughter ordered the Lengua and I ordered the griselda tacos.   Our waiter heads off after taking our order not to be seen again.  When we finally do get our food I noticed that we were given only two tortillas.   I looked at my plate and could tell immediately that something wasn't right.  I thought maybe the recipe had changed? Maybe tweaked a little? So I took a bite just to see.   The Griselda tacos have refried beans in them this is why I love that taco.  I flag someone over and told them that this taco should have beans in it. They tell me,  \"no it doesn't\".  I pull out my phone and pull up the menu and I have to show the gentleman exactly what the menu says he then realizes they made a mistake and ordered me the wrong taco. Again, I still haven't seen my waiter.  He pulled a vanishing act.   Such a shame this is always been one of my favorite places to go.   After waiting for 10 minutes to get more tortillas and my meal was replaced, all was good.   My tacos were terrible . It's like they were thrown together. I have to flag someone down to get my check. My waiter finally shows up.   I paid and left. I won't be going back."

                "description": "Saturday night 7:15ish we checked in online, to our surprise it was only a 7-17 minute wait!  What a great treat, since a couple weeks ago we attempted to eat downtown around 6pm when friends came into town and EVERYWHERE was a 3hr wait! NO THANKS.. After checking in with hostess upon our arrival, we decided to get a drink at the bar until our table was ready, to our delight the table was ready the minute our drinks arrived!  This place exudes a cozy date night feel, but also very accommodating for families or friend gatherings.  Our drinks were spot on, a frozen house margarita and a frozen mango margarita with a chili rim, both equally delicious.  After being seated, our waitress quickly brought us waters since we already had a cocktail and inquired if we would like any chips and salsa (those are extra).  After perusing the menu from the QR code we had to scan on the table, I asked the waitress her opinion from 3 choices I couldn't decide on (so she suggested the Pollo a la Maria) and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp Tacos.  After a short while our food came out.  My grilled Chicken (and plate) was piping hot and coated in a beautiful cilantro and pumpkin seed pesto and served with rice and frijoles a la charra.  The entire plate was a party in your mouth.  This is definitely not Tex Mex food, but more the flavors of inner Mexico.  The rice was super fluffy and flavorful as were the beans, although, I wished they had a little spice/heat, but none the less, they were delicious!  My boyfriend's Shrimp Tacos were served on a homemade corn tortillas topped with pickled onion, queso fresco and avocado (he chose to omit the cabbage lime slaw topping) and frijoles a la charra.  Let me say, the tacos were filled with plump juicy shrimp, not small little ones and fresh avocado slices completely on top not a little dab.  I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the taco fillings.  You definitely got what you paid for!  We ended the night with a To-Go order of churros served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce to dunk them in!  This is definitely be a place to meet friends and enjoy a great meal!... I can't wait to come back and try one of the other meals I contemplated.  The food was delicious, service spot on and drinks were top notch too!  I don't have one negative thing to say.  Although, I only debated between the 4 and 5 stars due to the parking lot was kind of a mess finding a spot the way it's laid out so we ended up having to park way out back in a parking lot for another building...so ok, that was my only issue, but other than that...you be the judge, I'm sure you'll be as pleasantly surprised too!"

                "description": "When I go to a place for the first time I can become nervous and anxious. I would be best served if I just allowed myself to surrender to the moment. A place like Bar Ludivine has a very specific patron in mind. The decor is very simply stated but elegant. The antique velour sofa with pillows with cats. The high tables candle lit. The choice of 90's and an early 2000's mixtape playlist as background music.  Yes it is shabby chic but with a modern flair. This is not a \"Happy Hour at Taco Cabana\" type of bar. Its intended audience is a sophisticated and more mature demographic. A bar certainly meant for date night or someone rummaging through a Schopenhauer book.  But to the mechanics of this bar. It is located in Southtown a few doors down from Taco Haven. The place is really small, intimate and charming. On the drink end they have spirits, wines and beer. The mixologist, who happens to be the principle owner serves up drinks and will take your order from your table. Although they have a small paper menu with signature cocktails he can make you just about anything. Here is where I must interject. If you're expecting a bartender from your corner cantina this is not that place. He serves you and then let's you carry on a conversation with your company. Maybe patrons will confuse that with inattentiveness. I interpreted that as being the utmost professional as a person who takes their craft very seriously.  Two or three things I must implore to you. Since it is on a strip of South Presa that has finite parking I can already forsee this as an issue in the future. Secondly they don't serve any food, which would automatically bump this review to a four and a half stars. And lastly this place is not cheap. I'm a beer drinker and seven dollars even for craft beer not in a restaurant setting is a little pricey. Then again a date night, an opportunity to see live music or even an after dinner cocktail are not casual affairs. Not to say that a suit with matching ascot is the preferred attire here. I might turn my head twice if I saw someone wearing a \"King Diamond\" tshirt and dangling earrings at a table though.  Ludivine, which is a French name that means \"Friend of the people.\" At that capacity it does share those sensibilities. The choice of antiques, the shabby chic decor and the elegant chandelier all say I'm here for a sophisticated experience. From the glassware to the presentation of drinks the cultured, mature patron is definitely kept in mind. Southtown is filled with unique experiences both big and small. If you happen to be in this area and were on a date night, left a Broadway play or had a Hemingway book on hand I would recommend it. The service is excellent, the drinks are made by someone who takes his craft seriously and the ambiance is otherworldly. It is pricey but on a beautiful Friday night you are totally worth it."

I don't normally review \"bars\" because for me a bar, is a bar, is a bar but when they get the ambiance, drinks and service right well you have to let them know!!  Working in healthcare can be a little stressful so an occasional drink to wind down before heading home is just what the doctor ordered!! And this place delivers!! Love the wine, love the beer, service is great, and was easy to find! Definitely a Southtown Gem!! Looking forward to coming back for Live Music Nights!"

Doesn't hurt that they added beer (nice selection!) and wine, then went all next-level and actually brought a full-on brewery (Vista) into the gorgeous brick building.  Nice long hours if operation too - I'm not by *any* stretch of the imagination what you would call a \"morning person\", so it's great to have awesome coffee available beyond 3 p.m.  Chefs kiss!"

We weren't sure what to expect from the outside but the inside was dope. Cool, comfortable seating, chill vibes and good coffee. Priced fairly and good treats if you are in the mood for something sweet to go with your coffee.   Pro tip: get a stroop waffle and place it on top of your coffee cup and it makes it nice and warm"

                "description": "If I could give 10 stars I would! Major shoutout to this place, it is by far the best coffee shop / roaster I've been too. We were in town visiting family and me being the coffee geek I am started looking up coffee shops / roasters in the area and Shotgun coffee roasters came up and I couldn't be happier for checking them out! We were immediately greeted by the smell of fresh coffee being roasted as we walked in. Super cool to check out the whole process from roast to cup. The Ethiopian V60 my fiance ordered and the cappuccino I ordered were done PERFECTLY! No joke, the barista who made our drinks is a true artist in his craft for sure. I like to consider myself somewhat knowledgeable of the coffee scene but this place reminded me of the amateur I still am, and I still have a LOT of learning to do lol. All the fruity, floral notes of the Ethiopian shined in a way only someone with the right experience in brewing could make happen. And the shots pulled for my cappuccino had absolutely no bitter / sour notes whatsoever. They were all done perfectly! From the woman roasting the coffee when we walked in to the awesome barista who prepared our drinks, seriously Kuddos to you guys! This will be our new go to spot when we land in SA from now on!"

You walk along the side till you see the drink fresh coffee wall sign. Go up the stairs there to the big metal door. Something else I had to figure out.   Inside is spacious with a modern/rustic vibe. So inviting. There were plenty of tables and some couches to sit. Some wall art, plants and merch. They also have an outside area as well.   I ordered an iced vanilla latte. It was a little stronger than what I usually get from coffee shops but that's by preference. I was in and out due to it being near their closing time but vibes alone I will definitely be going back."

                "description": "Sometimes I amaze myself when I land in a place like San Antonio and you would think I would go straight to one of the fancy tourist destinations to get myself a foo foo $6 coffee drink. No I decide to drive through rain and construction crews through back alleys to an unknown warehouse district that looks to have no life going on but cars wizzing by..  That's what it felt like when I'm walking in the back of this warehouse with an old wooden staircase and rusty industrial metal speakeasy looking entry.  Talk about getting local at the get go...  Once you exit the craziness of SA and enter this place,  immediate things begin to calm to a welcoming environment here.  The welcoming smell of fresh beans roasting, a dude mixing up batches of liquid Chai extract, and a a lady making things tidy  the fear of thinking Yelp let you down start to dissipate.    The baristas here know their coffee and although the menu seemed a bit limiting on first glance, they do have the basics down, with a few items that are unique like having vegan horchata and steamed rice milk. On the other hand they seem to not have a vegan chocolate option so that was a bit of a disappointment.  Their chai also is pre-made with sugar so there is no option to modify that one either so not super Keto friendly unfortunately. But they do make a matcha latte that is made unsweetened and with the rice milk option I was intrigued so went with that.  They also offer almond and oat as alternatives. Note they only do 12 oz latte drinks and they are not cheap when you figure in an alternative milk is going to drive up your drink cost in the 5 plus range.    The drink itself was well executed. They do nice latte art and normally green tea matcha can be a hit or miss if you are adverse to the grass aspect of the matcha powder. Here it's smooth and I really think rice milk works great together with matcha.    Love the atmosphere here.  They play 80's and 90's music in the background which is fun and it's not too loud so you can study and get things done. Also like that they had plenty of indoor spots open as there was rain and so the outside patio was pretty much not useable.  Also like the funky bathroom with the \"shotgun\" theme San Antonio style.  Only in Texas.  Oh and I forgot to mention that you can come here and have a beer too.  I didn't see any taps but they had a cooler of local beers.  Maybe next time will partake.   Glad I ventured off the beaten tracks. Always enjoy the local experiences.  If you to do so too this might be a fun option.  Check it out."

The entrance does not have a sign, just instructions on how to open the door with the latch.   Staff was really nice and attentive and the inside is a pleasant, wide, open space. My main issue is the roasting process. Before I walked over to the entrance there was a ton of smoke covering the stairs leading up to the door. When I finally walked in I asked if this was the main entrance and it was. Once seated inside I could feel the smoke all around despite the heavy use of fans. I went early morning and now my hair smells like burnt coffee all day long.   Leaving the place also requires instructions and two hands. Not very user friendly when you're walking out with a cup of coffee."

Having just moved to SATX from Portland, Oregon, I would offer my perspective as a pretty savvy coffee connoisseur, and this place could easily have been lifted and shifted from the streets of pretty much anywhere in PDX and dropped in San Antonio. It definitely had the same vibe, both good and bad ... Portland java jockeys can be by turns snooty and chatty, and today we got the more chilly shoulder than has been our SATX experience, but no worries! The java was delicious, and I very much enjoyed the decor. There is clearly talent behind the bar; we'll be back."

I didn't try the coffee while I was there b/c we happened to go on the night of the launch party for the brewery. I had the Destination IPA and it was quite yummy. Shotgun is urban, grungy, industrial and family friendly. Go there to have coffee and play a board game with the family or friends or go and have a brew with a mate. It has a great vibe."

While the front door itself was a challenge to find, the latte itself was well worth the effort. The atmosphere is open and inviting, perfect for maintaining socially appropriate distance during our current times. I could easily see myself returning to get work done given the free wifi and pleasant background noise. I was greeted not only by the friendly barista but also by the lovely aroma of coffee beans roasting. My drink, the maple-bourbon caramel latte with oat milk, was perfection. Not too sweet and full of fall-friendly flavor. I couldn't resist bringing home a bag of their Burundi coffee beans which continues to be the highlight of my morning. I can't wait to return and try more of their offerings!"

                "description": "I'd like to think I've done my fair share of indulging in beer tastings, festivals, tours and what not. But I've never, ever done a pub crawl. My point of reference has always been the one I have seen during First Friday. You know the one, the one with women in tutus and dudes in, tutus  running down St. Mary's Street. I imagine with all the barhopping from checkpoint to checkpoint sooner or later someone is gonna ralph all over a sidewalk.    However, I was talked into doing the one St. Arnold Brewery had put on recently as a promotional event. Five check in points for a pint glass created specifically for this event. You are given five locations to choose in any order: Stella Public House, Frank's, BandD's, The Friendly Spot and your final destination Alamo Street; a punchout card and roughly three hours to have it all filled. Pretty straightforward, right? Well.  A couple of things happened along the way while checking into places. One issue the flow of pub crawlers was not congruent with stay time. For example the Stella Public House was maxed out to capacity, due to the traffic of participants. I did skip it opting for Frank's a few yards down but nonetheless the results were the same. The thinking is that you had to have a drink at each point, which some people did. I must reiterate you don't have to drink anything at any of the locations to participate, you just have to have your card punched by a rep.  Moving from the direction of the Blue Star Complex towards the area of the Friendly Spot the crowds either tapered off or dissipated. For example BandD's was hours away from the mad rush. And The Friendly Spot had plenty of seating. In my opinion I think the event would've benefited from having locations  spread across Southtown, thus alleviating traffic and creating urgency. Another minor critique is I would've actually liked to have seen St. Arnold's booths of some sort offering their beers on tap or in a can at destinations.  Still in it's totality I enjoyed the experience despite some of its shortcomings. Seeing participants go from spot to to spot with their magic punchout card, as though it were an Olympic Event; was kinda inspiring. And the rad pint glass, my Major Award at the end was a sight to behold. I definitely would like to do one again at some point, I just need to begin training.  ps. I saw some people stumbling at the tail end. Lucky we didn't have to pass some torch or baton of some sort..."

                "description": "Cheers!  St. Arnold's Pub Crawl is so much fun!  The Houston brewery puts these on every year, or more often if you're lucky. Basically, you get a punch card at one of five local bars that are all close to each other. At each pub, you get your St. Arnold's card punched. Get them all punched, and collect a free special edition pint glass! Score! Prost!  St. Arnold's is the oldest independent brewery in Houston, the city's first real microbrewery. They've since moved to a bigger and classier location to churn out the beer! They offer a bunch of favorites, and usually some cool seaonals. Be sure to check out a different St. Arnold's beer at each stop!  You'll be sure to know where the crawl ends- you'll find St. Arnold's Art Car, plastered with St. Arnold's art, in the style of the Houston tradition and infamous Art Car Parade.  Did you know that Saint Arnold is the patron saint of brewers? In order to become a saint, you have to perform some miracles. St. Arnold's was that he and some thirsty worshipers were going on a pilgrimage, and came across an empty house, where they found a single beer, and a mug. They poured the beer into the mug, and started passing the beer around to the thirsty monks- but as they passed it around, it never went empty! The beer kept providing sustenance and booze to the monks until they could drink no more. It was a beer miracle! St. Arnold was canonized, as this beer obviously came straight from Heaven. When I went on the Pub Crawl, it was through Southtown, ending up in the Blue Star area."

Good for us as we were able to order and get our food rather quick.   There menu is huge and there is definitely something for everyone. It took me back to the days of my children being picky eaters and having to try and find each one something the would eat. Here there is everything from salad, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, soups, chicken, to other amazing dishes.   I was not starving so I went with the Enlightened Asian Chopped Salad. The dressing was tangy but good. I loved the mandarin oranges the really set off your tastebuds! I wound up only eating half and taking the rest home.    I ordered their Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer and they were amazing. I had some of those left over I took home as well.   The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly from the hostess to the waiter.   By the time we were leaving which was 6:15pm the place was jam packed. This place fills up quick!"

                "description": "Tonight was an adventure for sure. To start off, the managers were great. Now for the rest of the experience... For safety and security of the staff, names will be changed. While I was running late, my buddy had her paw caressed by the waiter (HAROLD) as he was handing her a mijito of sorts. She didn't appreciate this one bit. I arrived to the table and saw that it was happy hour! Those mozzarella sticks looks amazing and just had to have some. We ordered two orders, expecting them to come at happy hour price, only to be fooled, duped, and embarrassed. The happy hour menu items only apply to those ordering from the bar area. How the hell can I get a seat over there!? Why were we seated in the extra expensive seating? Anyways... As the food was arriving, we were graced by the presence of CARL. This kid was delivering food to tables. He had no idea what we ordered. He tried to give my friend a bacon burger when she ordered a brisket burger. Not knowing if it was correct, he put his paw ON THE BUN, lifted it up and proceeded to HAND IT BACK and say \"Well, enjoy!\". The entire table was disgusted and he never looked up to see the obvious error he had made. He couldn't have cared less. One of us got a manager and they offered to fix the situation by getting a new plate and gave my friend a new mojito. Our actual waiter told us that the kid \"was an interesting guy.\". Our pregnant friend ordered a burger well done and received a raw burger. This was also replaced and also attempted to charge for both! Among the events of the night, the booth seat ate another friend's phone. The managers told us that it happens ALL THE TIME. But they struggled to retrieve it even. We eventually retrieved the phone with a different manager. And then it was time to pay. To our complete surprise, we were charged for everything PLUS ITEMS WE DID NOT ORDER. The managers fixed the tickets but it was a struggle to think that only one section of the entire restaurant gets happy hour. The burger that was contaminated by a incompetent worker was charged to the bill. The entire time, our four member party was having a fun and light hearted time about everything that had happened but being charged for everything was an unexpected insult and unprofessional. Thanks for the memories, BJ's but we won't be back for a while. 2 stars for the laughs, -3 for the staff and bills."

Not sure if they're understaff or the staff that served us had no idea what she was doing. Sadly, the experience was substandard. My salad had old wilted Romaine lettuce. Other ingredients were to be found. Ugh. My husband asked for a second beer that never came. We asked for a meatball on my daughter kid spaghetti that never came either. I hope they get it together quickly, as this is a great place to eat and spend time with family. It was hard not to leave a 20% tip, but barely a 10%."

Service 2/3 stars Food     2/5 stars Accomodation 3/3 stars Overall 63.6%  The server was very attentive, appologetic, and seemed genuine. The 1rst entree I ordered was unavailable, but no hard feelings there considering my F@* @$$ ordered a pack meant to feed 4. We tried the cheese rolls which were meh...  The 2nd entree I tried to order ended up being sold out, which led to the 2nd appetizer order.but the WTFocado eggrolls were so horrible we did not even consider touching them. They came out with no sense of presentation and the sauce was missing. They were squished and looked like they were double dipped in the bat fryer. Perhaps they were served and the cook tried to re-cook a forgotten order and thought that monstrocity of a plate was presentable. (See picture) The guy who brought out the food just dropped the plate at our table like a passive aggressive ex who got called out by a judge during a divorce preceeding.  My 3rd entree request was finally available, but oh I wish it wasn't. I often order the Jambalaya, but this time what came out was a smaller, burnt, less appealing version like ordering airpods on amazon, but getting some pear brand knock off instead. The Pizookie tasted good, just lacked any presentation which literally is just scooping ice cream onto a warm cookie.     The manager apologized for overall poor food, and the waiter for the trouble the night that ensued. Our meal was mostly comped and all I really paid for was my beer and desert, and decent tip for the poor server."

There's no temperature check at the entrance and lots of customers standing and waiting with no physical distance enforcement. Ordered curbside service but there's no parking enforcement. I also learned this BJ's restaurant has dine-in available. This explains the crowd of customers waiting to get seated. I called from the parking lot. The curbside team was overwhelmed and requested I come in. My curbside delivery order became takeout. After waiting 25 minutes past my 5:30pm pickup time, my order arrived.  This was definitely my worst experience at this BJ's restaurant location. IMO, was the best one in the San Antonio area. Overall rating 1 star. Management needs to focus their efforts on takeout and online orders. The limited dine-in capacity due to COVID-19 does not generate enough business."

The service was good and fast, so their curbside service was great this time. The food was pretty good, no major complaints there other than they forgot my sauce for my salmon.

Today not only did it taste nasty. It was NOT the same pizza from last weekend. I ordered same pizza and toppings. They left out the pepperoni and and all I got was a flat tasteless pizza. With wayyyyy too much cheese. The crust wasn't fluffy and light. It was flat and the pizza itself is dense and soggy. We go there for the great chicken wings, wedge salad with the Tri Tip and their yummy homemade sodas. I don't think we'll be frequenting anytime soon. Threw it out. They need to have some consistency with the way it's cooked and prepared. Really disappointed as the rest of the meal was pretty good."

                "description": "Wish I took pictures of the place. There were only about 2-3 tables taken with plenty of empty tables in between. They sat my husband and I in the back room where the staff was having a meeting. I thought it  was weird that they sat right next to their meeting, it was a little uncomfortable cause it felt like we were interrupting there meeting. Then they started to bring more costumers to that same room, I stood up thinking they were packed, but what we realized was that they were seating all Hispanics and blacks in the back. We ordered, ate, paid our bill. As we walked out we scanned the whole restaurant and saw that only whites were seating in the main room. That was unbelievable! I thought discriminating people for their color was over! I guess I was wrong. This needs to stop!"

My husband found a curved piece of black plastic in his clam chowder. (Found it in his mouth after taking a spoonful) We told the server who got the manager. The manager came to table to apologize and told us he would compensate us (which was never done!). Said that the vendor probably burned a piece of clam shell and left it in the soup. Took my husband's name and number because he would need to include it with the report to the vendor. Then the manager told us he would come back at the end of our meal to get more information. He never did. No discount. Nothing. You just lost a customer BJ's!!"

Will never go back. Waited for food for 45 minutes n the food was cold. The table next to us was serviced quicker.  N the server had lot of attitude with no thank you or please.

I've eaten at taco carts in Mexico where the meats were grilled off an old steel auto wheel. That was amazing. BJ's on the other hand is meant to people who can't taste. Well there you go. COVID has taken the taste and smell from the return customers here. That is the only explanation I can come up with. Plus the place was filthy AF. The Mexican taco cart was immaculate in comparison to this restaurant. One one thing that was on point was our server. I'm sure this cat knew how shitty it was to go eat here that he went above and beyond so that we wouldn't complain. Which we never do because I use to work I. The food service industry and the number one rule is don't F with people who Handel your food.   Bathrooms were disgusting as well. I've peed in back alleys at boys town in Mexico what were in better conditions than this bathroom here."

We each had a nutty brewnette to drink then ordered a spicy pig tavern cut pizza and the spicy peanut chicken soba noodles. Both of us had stomach cramps on the way home and found ourselves puking dinner back up 20 minutes later. We both shared the food so no idea which plate caused the problem.   We'll still go to the Alamo ranch location but the rim is out. Really too bad because the service from the bartenders was really great."

I really dislike the digital menus, perhaps I should have asked for a regular one.  My club was excellent, however my fries came out after my sandwich. That was strange, I never have had that happen before. My beer was also on the warm side, I'm not sure if it sat on the bar for a while or their coolers are a bit warm.  I would eat here again, but I would probably go for a mixed drink or try a bottled beer.   The other items brought to our table looked excellent too, I tried the tomato-mozzarella salad, and have to say it was incredibly good."

It took 10 minutes to get a Moscow mule with that much else going on at the bar, being that we were just there to relax I wasn't super irritated but let's be honest the bartender was Mia 50% of the time we were at the bar sitting down. We got food to go which we found out when we got home that his order was wrong, asked for jalapeÃ±os on the his pizza and they put olives but jalapeÃ±os was on the ticket so definitely a kitchen error, overall I would order Togo from here again or do pick up."

Anyway, the food arrived and yes it was good.   I love the deep dish veggie pizza. I just wish it was just out of the oven. It was still good if cold  but if I am going to be eating that much bread the carbs have to be worth it.   The queso dip with hatch green chilis and chips, good!  Fish and chips were delish, fish was fresh amd meaty, not just breading.

                "description": "My partner and I are fans of BJ's Brewhouse and decided to eat here for date night. We requested a table outside but the hostess ignored our request and seated us indoors. Not a big deal, however, with COVID-19, I think it's important to honor a guest's request, especially if outdoor tables are available. She also could have let us know that it would be a wait if there weren't tables available. We saw that they had put in plexiglass between the booths and went ahead and sat down in the booth that was offered to us. Something that I did notice were that the tables were not spaced out 6 feet. If you were sitting at a table, you would be back to back with another party and wouldn't be 6 feet away from them.   Our meal was just okay - we ordered the prime rib that is on special on the weekends and a wings appetizer. The appetizer and main entree came out quickly, however, it took some time for our pizookie to arrive. We normally wouldn't order dessert but it came with the prime rib special, so why not? Our server seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables he was given, however, we still received drink refills and our check in a timely manner. We noticed on our way out that there was a big crowd waiting to be seated and most patrons were not practicing social distancing. We won't be visiting again anytime soon, but I wanted to share my experience in case you were thinking of eating here."

We came here Sunday at 1, and many of the more popular restaurants at The Rim were over an hour wait time. BJ's was able to sit our party twelve immediately.  I like that BJ's has an extensive menu, so there is a little something for everyone. Since I just did a two hour hike I wanted to treat myself. I ended up getting the Fresh Atlantic Salmon (840 calories) and the BJ's Baked Beignet (630) calories. Both were good.  The service was pretty fast and the waiter did a good job managing a party of our size. There were 40 inch TVs round the restaurant for us to catch the NBA playoffs."

So the daily specials we were used to for dinner on certain days are only for dinner, so don't go for lunch hoping to get the ribs on Thursday.   I decided to try the Meat Lovers Piadina, comes with pepperoni, Italian sausage, meatballs, basil and their cheese blend. The waitress explained it as the topping wrapped up in the thin crust, so in my head I'm thinking like a calzone. It comes and it's literally the crust folded over the toppings like a crispy panini. First thought, this is different. Comes with a ramekin of marinara sauce to tip into. First bite, wow. The crispness of the crust and the seasoning of the marinara inside with the toppings, just wow. Loved it! Was torn between this one and the chicken bacon ranch, and I bet that would've been just a great!  Wife got the half California club flatbread and a house salad. Crust was just a amazing and the toppings were fresh! Avocado on top was the perfect green and the tomatoes were just right!"

You can't go wrong with what has been labeled as a restaurant favorite; deep dish pizza. I suggest requesting it arrive well-done for extra crispiness.   The menu is large so if you're indecisive I suggest checking out the menu online prior to arrival.  It should be noted that a 5-star rating does not mean there isn't room for improvement. The calamari, while good, should include rings instead of just the body and tentacles. There was not enough meat to include the parts served and therefore I was left wanting for meaty, ring shaped servings."

For my entree I ordered enlightened thyme chicken with brussel sprouts and brown rice, etc.  The chicken was hot, but rice and vegetables were lukewarm.  I asked the waiter to heat it up in the microwave. He didn't.  He had them remake it and still was lukewarm.  Brussel sprouts were not fresh. Tasted spoiled, to be honest.  Keep your expectations low."

                "description": "Since we've moved here to San Antonio, finding good Italian places to eat at has been a struggle.   Well, no more! We have found \"our place \"! We did have reservations (highly recommend you have reservations as well) and were seated promptly. The young girls that greeted us were very cheerful and welcoming. Definitely the right people at the door!  Our waiter (forgot his name) was great, since it was our first visit, we went with his recommendations and he was spot on from the appetizer to main entrees. Honestly, I wish I could've sampled everything on the menu.   The restaurant was very clean and the kitchen looked very prepared. This place has a very cool outdoor seating area. Definitely a great place for happy hour and meeting up with friends or colleagues after work.   To say the least, this will be our go-to Italian place from now on.   Gray job everyone!"

Also got a white pizza. and burrata as appetizer. Would definitely go again. The only reason why I give it four stars is because the server we had was not attentive at all. We did not come at an odd time, but his service to us felt really rushed. He came around only once after the food came out and my water glass was empty majority of the lunch.   Hopefully when we come back, our next server would be better!"

                "description": "RECOMMENDATION: ask for reduced salt  I've eaten at North Italia several times.  The ambience is lively and upscale, the servers are professional and friendly and the food is excellent. My only reason for rating four stars is because the dishes are notoriously over salted.  On one occasion I sat at the bar for lunch and when I ordered the salmon on my salad, the bartender even suggested I should order with \"reduced salt\" because he feels everything is too salty as prepared.  I usually forget to mention this when I order though, and feel slightly disappointed; otherwise everything is excellent.  I love the salads and have tried both the salmon and scallops, which are wonderful. For desert, the Caramel Bodoni is divine and not too heavy."

                "description": "First time visiting North Italia. I had been wanting to go for the longest time, and finally, I had my chance. It is located at the Rim, next to Lick ice cream and Luxor, Mediterranean food. Both added to my list of places to visit in the Rim.  I went to North Italia to meet a friend and we ordered a cesar salad and a pizza to share. Service was pretty good and the food came out fairly quickly. We ordered the Pig Pizza, which has sopressatta, pepperoni and Italian sausage. It was quite good and is a shareable size. I also liked that our waitress separated the salad into two separate bowls.   The pizza prize was $17, which I felt was reasonable, but the cesar salad at $12 was high for the portion. I also felt that the rest of the prices, especially for some of the pasta plates were extremely high. As an example, the Bolognese pasta was $20 dollars!   So, although the service and food pretty tasty, I don't know that I would return due to prices."

                "description": "The service couldn't have gotten any better.   My husband and I decided to try North while running some quick errands and we weren't disappointed. We were quickly welcomed and seated by the hostess and this is just a beautifully aesthetic restaurant and you can really tell the time they put into the details.   We had Monique and 2 trainees serving us today and they were thorough in walking us through the menu and taking our orders. We ordered everything they recommended - crispy calamari, white truffle garlic bread, their daily pizza and a chicken Cesar salad.   The calamari was light and really offset the white truffle garlic bread - which was super tasty and I love how they incorporated the truffle.  The daily pizza was an Italian sausage with red peppers and olives and paired perfectly with their Cesar salad.  There wasn't any room for dessert so we'll definitely be back for drinks and dessert."

                "description": "Took the kids to dinner before going to look at Christmas lights.  We had a great dinner and great service.  We started with the Zucca Chips, which were gone so fast, I barely got any.  I also had a side salad with pine nuts and blue cheese and it was really good.  My husband had the squid ink pasta with shrimp and really enjoyed it.  My daughter had the spaghetti and meatballs and raved about the meatballs, so I tried them and really liked them.  The spaghetti sauce was a little to sweet for my taste but the pasta noodles were fresh and cooked Al dente.  My son loved his chicken parmesan.  It was definitely the biggest portion, but he ate it all.  I had the Bolognese and was pleasantly surprised.  It was very hearty and comforting.  We have been to North before, but this was definitely a better experience.  We will be back for sure."

                "description": "I've been to North Italia in Plano, TX and Austin, TX and the San Antonio location is just as great!! I went for HH on a Friday afternoon around 4pm. My friend and I were seated right away at a high top by the bar. They have a really awesome special where you get a bottle of wine and a pizza for $30!!! The service was great and the ambience is really nice. Not too loud, it was a great place to catch up with my friend over yummy food.   When you go, you MUST get the garlic bread. Probably one of the best garlic breads I've ever had. The zucca chips are also delicious. Would 100% recommend this place to anyone looking for a nicer italian restaurant."

                "description": "I've been wanting to check this place out for sometime but hadn't had an opportunity until my granddaughter's 18th birthday. She picked it so why not?   Nice ambiance, can be romantic or seat a party of 14 like it did for us. There is no dress code but it's a nice place people make it special. It also has a nice patio outside for those of you who like that vibe.   The drinks were really good I tried the old fashion and would order it again. A ginger margarita and a sangria was also ordered - I forgot to take pictures before we started drinks but everyone said they would definitely order again.   For appetizers we tried the calamari and the white truffle garlic bread both were yummy. With the bread, don't forget to spread the butter with garlic truffle on each piece-not everyone at the table knew to do that.  I ordered the glazed short rib cavatelli it was delicious and the meat was really tender.  The spicy rigatoni vodka, chicken pesto, wagu skirt steak tagliata, chicken Parmesan, strozzapreti and the diver scallops were all ordered at our table and not one person was disappointed- I have to say I did try each one and now need to think about what I want to order when I come back because they were all so good!"

                "description": "I tried North Italia in Houston several years ago because it was convenient to the office I was visiting (and I read that Drake had eaten there and I figured if it was good enough for him then it was good enough for me, haha). I'd eaten there twice because I thought the food was great so I was glad to hear that one was opening in SA. I'm not sure if I visited on an off night or the quality just isn't the same at The Rim. The staff was friendly but didn't seem to be very experienced. I ordered the Italian Clover cocktail and it tasted medicinal, which tends to happen if the maker shakes it too many times. The Caesar was very good but I would have preferred if it had been more authentic with anchovies and I wasn't a fan of the radicchio, which did add color but also a bitter taste. I did appreciate that our waiter asked if I would like a half order of the salad (that way I could still have room for dessert!). My husband ordered the arugula and avocado salad because we enjoy the salad from another restaurant. Italia's version barely had the lemon taste that makes it so refreshing.  The white truffle garlic bread had a nice presentation stacked in a tiny cast iron pan but I believe it would have tasted better if the bread wasn't cut so thick so that the garlic, cheese and oil could have been more evenly distributed on each bite. I'd eaten the meatballs before and thought they were delicious. I had a bite of my husband's spaghetti dish and the meatballs were just fine, not special. I ordered the branzino and it was good if you like fish that isn't too \"fishy\" and want a lighter meal.   For dessert our waiter recommended the Salted Caramel Budino. I love the contrast of salty and sweet and this satisfied, especially with a glass of prosecco.  I'm glad I got to try SA's North Italia but I don't plan to return any time soon.  As with any nice restaurant nowadays, I highly recommend a reservation, especially on the weekend. It was packed with lots of Rim shoppers and young people, probably students from UTSA."

                "description": "This one I was on the bubble of giving it four stars. I feel the food quality and menu selection is the best thing they have going for them. It may be partly we arrived for dinner at 430pm and asked if they had any happy hour drink specials. The waitress said that is only for people sitting at the bar or at a high table. Ironically we were the first table closest to the bar. Only a few feet separated getting happy hour drink specials. That kind of turned us off.   The food itself was good and I liked the diverse menu selection. I had the Glazed Short Rib pasta meal. It was super flavorful. Not a fan of horseradish I asked if that could be on the side. When my food arrived it was delivered by a server and not our waitress. I sampled it and could not taste the horseradish. I asked the waitress and she was clueless. Goof news is it was a great tasting dish. So if you are not a fan of horseradish I am guessing it is very mild.  The portion size was just right for a normal sized portion. To be clear it was not your normal oversized restaurant portion.   My wife had the pesto and loved the flavor. This place was good but not confident worth the price to value.   I am sure we will try it again."

                "description": "Goodness me it took forever for us to get our food, even our water...  After we got seated, our table had to flag down our waitress twice before we finally got our waters (15 minutes). We ordered the Arancini, Margherita Pizza and Heirloom Tomato and Burrata. The food came 40 minutes into our dining experience. Thankfully the food was very tasty.  Arancini - SO. BOMB. Their risotto was perfectly cooked, they seasoned it just enough so that the flavor of the tomato sauce elevated it to perfection. I think the idea of frying it was so smart. The crispiness from frying the risotto balls was a great idea as well. It added much needed texture to the dish.  Margherita Pizza - Great, but not spectacular. Not much to say about this dish honestly.  Heirloom Tomato and Burrata - Delish! The tomatoes tasted very fresh and I loved burrata cheese. Their choice of oil was very fragrant and everything was perfectly seasoned."

                "description": "The first time I had North was in Phoenix and it was not my favorite. Fast forward a few years later and I am living in New Braunfels with just a handful of Italian restaurants nearby. Headed down to San Antonio and gave this a shot for a late lunch.   Started with the prosciutto bruschetta - prosciutto was soft with just enough chew before melting in the mouth. Bread was toasty but did not have a burnt taste. It compares to my favorite bruschetta spot.   Chopped chicken salad - nice and light in the mouth. Veggies were crisp. Pine nuts added a bit of crunch to add to the texture.   Contadina salad - I should start off and say I was really eyeing the squid ink pasta and instead went with this salad. As the dish was presented, our server said he is more of a \"steak and potatoes\" kind of guy and doesn't like salads but this was his favorite salad going through training because it was so flavorful. I'll have to say this is true as the salad is very flavorful. The rosemary ham swirls have some type of cheese in them that I was not expecting; not bad just would have preferred just ham. I almost ordered this without croutons but I'm glad I left them in because they added a nice texture. Watermelon radish was a nice added crunch and the heirloom tomatoes were a burst of freshness.   This second time at North was a 180 of my first experience and I am looking forward to trying more of the menu (looking at that squid ink pasta)!"

                "description": "The restaurant in San Antonio just opened a few days ago.  We were extremely excited about it!  We ate at this brand before but in different locations in Austin.  All the pasta here are freshly made daily in the restaurant!!!!!!  Yesterday we came here to give it a shot.   It was super busy during the grand opening, so make sure you go online to reserve a table before showing up.  We reserved a table a week earlier.  Atmosphere:  Excellent!  The restaurant is elegantly designed.  Very trendy and contemporary but casual.  There is a beautiful patio area where so you could enjoy outdoor dinning.    Food:  Very good!  As I said all pasta are freshly made daily in house.  I wish the pasta that we ordered was not over cooked.  It could be a bit firmer to demonstrate the texture.  But that is my personal preference.  Others might like their pasta softer.  The sauce is delicious!  Service:  Excellent!  I could give the restaurant a five star if the pasta were not over cooked a bit.  That could be one isolated incident.  I will definitely come back here to give it another try.  Overall, I recommend this place for all pasta and pizza lovers."

There was a hostess out front with an iPad, but I don't know if that is just because they are new.   We started with the grilled bread and olive oil. It was covered in grana padano and balsamic and was delicious. I wanted something else, but my wife insisted on this and I am happy we did.   My wife got the Tuscan half chicken that came with a corn and zucchini salad. It was really salty, but not too much. I got the beef short rib cavatelli, which was also incredible. We split the tiramisu. It was a good portion and had these little coffee beads on top that gave it a little crunch.   Our server had a trainee and they were great. Between them and the rest of the service staff, we didn't have an empty plate or glass on our table for more than a minute.   There is a parking garage across the street and a valet stand nearby, but I'm not sure of their hours or cost. There is also a ton of street parking in the area."

                "description": "What a charming place this was! My friends and I decided to come by on a Wednesday evening for happy hour. It wasn't very busy and we were immediately seated in a nice booth that created the illusion of separation. I couldn't see anything behind me! This is a good thing btw!  We ordered some drinks and apps for the table. A couple Old Fashions, Mexican tea, and a drink off the secret menu that was delicious but I can't remember the name. The drinks were beautiful and tasty.  For the table we had the lemony hummus, the charcuterie, the hot Nashville chicken sliders, a cheeseburger, and honey butter chicken biscuit.  The lemony hummus came with fresh, crispy carrots, watermelon radishes, and celery. The hummus was creamy and tangy. It has a lot of dill, but I didn't mind that at all.  The chicken was a tad burned, but it was good the biscuit was soft and yummy, but it could have used a little more honey. I think the cheeseburger was the star. It was perfectly cooked and just hit the spot. The fries were also good. Just what I wanted!  The charcuterie was tiny, but it had some great treats.   And our waiter was phenomenal. He was attentive and super engaging. He gave us lots of information and we had a lot of fun small talk with him too."

How can you go wrong?! Meatloaf!!! honey butter chicken biscuit with a fried egg on top with Tallow Fries! Delicious. Housemade lemon and dill hummus. Amazing. You cannot go wrong with anything on the food or drink menu. You will not be disappointed."

                "description": "Food took f o r e v e r  to arrive. Server was nice but food took so long at one point she said it would be here but then It didn't come for another 30 minutes, this was around 4 pm  When it arrived, the scallops had enormous amounts of sausage like ham. Not sprinkled but probably a third of the dish. This was NOT in the menu. It was hard to push aside there were so many and we were afraid to send any food back due to the time it took to arrive. We had 2 orders of scallops around $35 each for only 3 scallops.  We also ordered the special meat loaf, that was good.  Bring a sweater, it is freezing in there and certain booths have the air blowing directly at you.  Interesting place, but too pricey for what you get... not much."

                "description": "So this place always comes up on my searches so my husband and I decided to give it a try. When I go to a restaurant I like to evaluate it not only on a basis of food, but also the theme. The servers are in character - they are dressed as if they are mechanics with trucker hats. Nice touch to the restaurant given that it has an overall vintage gas station/industrial look.   Space/layout: Definitely a fun place to go to for brunch. They can accommodate large parties and have a bar. The decor around the restaurant are instgrammable, so if you are into that go ahead and cop yourself a pic.  Food: Not gonna lie, the food we order was a little bit more on the saltier side (Dirty Hash and the Shakshuka). Not sure if it was the cook that day or if the cook over shot the salt, but my husband and I had a difficult time finishing our food since it was a tad bit salty. Portion is great, presentation is amazing, but too salty. I am willing to give this place another try. Other than the saltiness, the food here is really good. But come thru and see how the food taste yourself!   P.S. Order a biscuit, it's really, really good here! Homemade and fresh."

He paid a Tribute to the King!!  So, when we walked in, there were two hostesses at the front. They asked if we had reservations, which we did not. I told them it was fine, that we could walk next door to Krause's and next time I would make a reservation.  Well, all I can say is that those two hostesses moved heaven and earth to accommodate us! They perused the seating chart and came up with a 'plan' for us. As long as we could be done by 6:30p they had a table for two. We told them that we had to be at the Brauntex at 6:30p, so all was good.  At first, we thought they were just going to sit us in the back room.  LOL  We didn't realize that the restaurant went that far back.  And our waitress (Can't remember her name!) What a hoot. She was a pleasure to have. Answered all of our questions about the menu, etc. She brought water out in this cool bottle ... She told me I could have it ... And then wrestled it out of my arms when I tried to leave ... Just Kidding!! And then our food came. It was delicious!  And we were walking out of the restaurant at 6:30p.  KUDOS to everyone that took care of us!"

She was pleasant, knowledgeable and had a very pleasant demeanor.  We had the following lunch item - because breakfast was NOT available.   Sandwiches: 1. Meatball - I had grilled jalapeÃ±os- the sandwich was very good.  2. BLT - we were told that it had fried green tomatoes. The sandwich had red fried tomatoes and caused the sandwich to be mushy.  3. Ruben - it was hand cut pieces of corned beef. The sandwich was very fatty and my son could only eat half of the sandwich.   The place was very clean and nice. We will try it again - but make it to Bruch and try the eggs, pancakes and French toast."

Downtowner is a GastroCraft hotspot with some great live music evenings. The bar manager and bartenders are excellent and watching them work is great entertainment. Their craft beer selection is excellent and their wine selection is solid. The crafty menu is very good as the pics show but they may want to consider healthier more vegetarian options for that rapidly growing demographic. Their folks are super friendly.   You really should check it out!   Make reservations!"

She got to us as soon as we sat down and continued to check on us. The restaurant was busy, but it did not take too long to get our food.  The unsweet tea was good, garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, so were the fries and blueberry cobbler.  The kid cheese pizza was meh. I got the fettucine alfredo and did not like it. The sauce was thick, not creamy and did not have a good flavor. It came with three toasted breads which did not have butter or seasoning, so were flavorless and dry.  I personally did not like it, but my toddler ate some and seemed to like it.   The Big Rock Nachos were good. In the past, I have tried the \"Karat\" Cake, which is also good.  I would return to this location, but would get something else next time."

                "description": "Last week we met friends fir happy hour,  when our waiter Huntington asked how my drink was I said not very good,  he did not offer anything.  I ordered  shrimp tacos,  the shrimp was chopped into such small pieces, there probably wasn't e en 1 shrimp in the 3 tacos! Again , Huntington asked how it was, I told him not good! I asked him to tell the manager! He didn't offer me anything. Manager never came to talk to me. Stone Works should take a lesson from  Cover3! When there was a problem, our waiter immediately did something to make it right and the manager came over, comped our food and offered us dessert.  All restaurants have problems, it's how they  handle them that makes the difference! I won't be returning to Stone Works  anytime  soon!!!"

                "description": "Hadn't been to Stone Werks in over 10 years.  I had very faint memories of the food being average and overpriced - and with Covid-19 I was worried this place would have a limited menu.   I came here with my grandma and we were looking for some healthy options.  Let me tell you, the food was FANTASTIC.  I ordered the Pan-seared Salmon with a vegetable medley and mashed potatoes.   I am very picky about my salmon because it's very easy to overcook it dry.  The fish was light, moist, seasoned extremely well and it cut like butter!! The potatoes were fluffy and flavorful. The vegetables were crisp and fresh.  Our waiter Josh was very attentive and so polite, even when we asked for extra things.   And one unique thing I have to say is that  the booth seats are SO COMFORTABLE! If I'd brought a blanket and pillow I might never leave- Ha!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Blanco/Stone Oak area looking for a nice dinner.  This is the perfect spot for a date night or family outing.   Stone Werks has really stepped up their game as far as food and service. I will definitely be coming back."

                "description": "This restaurant used to be on my GO TO list for sure. I have visited numerous times in the past couple years. I will never step foot in this location again. It's a huge inconvenience too as I just live right up the street in Stone Oak...  But I will survive. I have no mercy for businesses that do not value every guest that walks thru their door at a time like this. You are not privileged, and you are the face of your company.   So I go in to check on a to go order and it is taking a bit so I ask how much longer, and I am not in any way rude about it. As a matter of fact I even thanked the young lady and went to have a seat by the hostess stand and got on my phone to mind my own business and wait. Not even 5 minutes pass and this man, who I know to be the manager, comes over and asks what I need. Not, how are you this evening? Or is there something I can do for you? No. Very bluntly just what... so I say I've already been helped and he mumbles something so I asked if there was a problem and he said \"I don't know. Is there?\"...  so you mean to tell me because I was not a dine in customer and I wasn't dressed to impress, you know, had my tats showing and my sunglasses on my head, and I dared to ask how much longer an order was going to be, I get the stereotypical treatment. This place has me mistaken for someone who will not care where they spend their hard earned money. I always try and give back. I know times are tough and my family and I are very sensitive to that. We tip generously and we treat people with kindness. We very rarely eat at home.  So with that being said I will not patron places where they do not treat each and every individual with kindness and respect. I don't care if you have money and frequent there often or you just got an unexpected bonus and wanted to treat your family to a nice dinner for once, yet you don't really \"look like you belong\". Everyone deserves to be treated the same and STONE WERKS on Blanco and 1604 has missed the mark on that one. And their managers are the shining example of what it's like to be a boss and NOT a leader.  Such a shame. But there are hundreds of other places in San Antonio that appreciate everyone and all they bring to their business, especially during a time such as this.  Just remember, every person who walks thru your door is a potential guest, or has been one in the past. If you fail to recognize that you have no one to blame but yourself."

I gravitate towards laid back, classy, chill vibes and this place has got it.  Every drink I have ordered here has been exceptional. This time I got the Skinny Mojito and it along with the sweet potato fries and turkey burger were fantastic.  The lady at the bar was very friendly and helpful. They have a fire place and heat lamps for chillier days. Today it was perfect weather so no need. I recommend trying this place on a nice day. The patio is so inviting, you will never wanna leave."

Our drink took about 30 mins to come out, and only after we had to remind the waitress about it. Then when the food did come, it was barely warm. The shrimp in my tacos were either chopped up into tiny pieces or they used baby shrimp, but it was skimpy at best. It was a shame as this place used to be really good."

Before I took this tour, I did the River Walk boat tour, I took a educators class at the Alamo and took my time after the tour to watch the video and read all the info, I went to Mission San Jose and took the tour there and I also took the Pearl Brewery tour. Then I came to this tour....I had my tour with Brent. Wow talk about having an intimate look at San Antonio. He was full of knowledge. He talked about some of San Antonio's not so well known heroes, but made a but impact in the city. Brent was a great tour guide. Be sure to reserve your spot for the tour and wear walking to running shoes.  On the day I went, it rained in the morning. The rain must of scared some people off.  By the time the tour started it was dry. For my group there was just a handful of us.  The weather in SA is weird. But don't let stop you. Just bring an umbrella and light jacket for the colder months."

                "description": "I loved my first tour with Amigo Free Walking Tours this evening! Our tour guide was Brent Salter, and his enthusiasm, humor, and knowledge of San Antonio and its history kept me entertained for the full tour! Today was one of the hottest days of the year, but most of the tour was in the shade, as the sun was setting, or down on the Riverwalk, where the pleasant breeze made it very easy. San Antonio has been my home for almost 30 years, but I learned a lot, and can hardly wait to come back for more!"

                "description": "This tour guide was simply EXCELLENT! I was worried at first because his tour is advertised as free but went with my gut that he must be good... allowing us to set his wage. I am so glad I did! Our family has enjoyed tours all over Rome, Sorrento, New Orleans, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston, but Brent ranks as one of our favorite so far. He was thorough in his history, organized in his delivery, and stories were flavored with light humor and a bit of fun dramatization. It is clear he is passionate about his city, his country, and his work. (He voiced a sincere thank you to everyone in uniform that passed by)  Brent gave an understandable synopsis of the complicated history of the battle of the Alamo and brought us listeners up to speed with the current city struggle about the rebuilding of the Alamo wall. The 2 hrs of walking was leisure with plenty of spots, even shaded, to rest as he shared the details of each location. This would be totally do-able with strollers and for walking children and adults, though teens and older are who would most enjoy this information. The timing of our tour was perfect, 4-6, so we left our tour to enjoy a wonderful dinner on the riverwalk. The tour is free, but let's not take that for granted. He is well worth a generous fair wage donation/tip/income at the end. I am so thankful I was prepared with cash on hand. This is the kind of guide our group would love to have for all trips. This was so good, we are now scheduled to take his King Williams district tour later this month. By the way, we live here~ and still appreciated the new details we learned."

Even facts I already knew about Texas history were presented and built on in new ways, with entertaining anecdotes and stories. Questions were answered fully and with charm. I especially enjoyed walking a section of Riverwalk, learning the stories about the people and buildings behind the boutiques and cafes. Reservations recommended, but feel free to text at the last minute if you want to try to catch a tour. Highly recommend."

Our walk was well paced, plenty of places to stop and rest and learn about a site but we still managed to cover all the scenic areas downtown along the river. I highly recommend this tour, it was the highlight of our stay in San Antonio."

They might not have everything but it's a pretty well-balanced selection with both popular items and local stuff.  And because this is the nearest liquor store that doesn't seem shady, I always come here to pick up a bottle of TX whiskey to take home with me.  I will say that being in here 3 times already, the woman who owns the place has both been very friendly and also a little standoffish and borderline rude which I could see some of the negative reviews."

They carry all different kinds of alcohol, many you wouldn't expect to find it a small local shop. It's in this quaint little house one block off of St Mary's behind El Mirador Mexican restaurant. Besides just about any kind of alcohol you can imagine, they also sell cute little things. They've got jewelry and there are usually these cute cards that are handmade by local artists. AND they of course have an amazing fiesta medal this year (2018). They love pets and always have a little doggie biscuit for my puppy. And there's a water bowl outside.  So to sum it up, I love this store, support local and buy your booze here, that's what I'm saying!"

I'm always amazed that there aren't more places in the downtown area to grab a bottle to go. You gotta hike across Caesar Chavez to find this place. It has recently moved around the corner from the old location by the Filling Station to a small house on the other side of the La Villita Hotel.  They have a decent selection of spirits, wines and beers. They sell their stuff clearly marked as to the price, so there's no guessing. When I went, the clerk was on the ball, making recommendations, and was quite helpful. They also sell all kinds of other booze paraphernalia, like wine glasses and bottle openers.  The prices are a bit higher than you'd expect to pay at the big places, but the extra assistance and convenient location makes it absolutely worth it.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge, you gotta park on the street, and that can get busy. I'm as happy as a pig in slop in this place! Weee weee  weeeee!"

It seems to be run by some nice and well-meaning women, but the beer selection is not very different from a 7-eleven...Maybe 20-30 of the most common regional and macros, virtually no bombers, and when I asked if they carry Jester King the reply was 'I think we don't have that IPA'.   To the owners, double your cold beer storage capacity and find someone who can deliver a nicely curated beer list including Jester King and Adelbert's. Given your social media reputation and proximity to downtown, I bet you'd 2x-3x your annual revenue. You have a real opportunity."

                "description": "Oh Q Kitchen Bar thanks for simply being the best!   I stayed at the Hyatt for 19 days and frequently stopped by the Q Bar because the food was tasty, the drinks delicious, and the service fantastic. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays live music was played during the evenings which was very pleasant.   They had a menu change while I was there so I'm not sure if everything I ate is still available. I particularly loved the brisket flatbread but the shrimp avocado tacos was where it was at. They were large, flavorful, and quite filling! I found when I wanted a light meal they were absolutely perfect. The avocado caprese salad was good but would have liked more cheese and less avocado. Once the cheese was gone I didn't think the avocado could carry the tomato like the cheese could.   But with any restaurant it was the people working there that made me come back time and time again. Leeza and DJ were super pleasant to talk with - easy going, good listeners, and very responsive. There was another bartender whose name I didn't catch who was also very responsive and noticed when I needed something.   Then there was Ryan who became part of my vacation experience because his knowledge of cocktails and alcohol was astounding. When the evenings were slow he would experiment with ingredients and come up with an array of flavors that were just marvelous. I am quite astounded that a craft cocktail bar hasn't swooped in to steal Ryan away but I am sure the Hyatt realizes how amazing of a bartender there is.   But my shoutout has to go to Isaac. Isaac warmly greeted me when I first came and made me feel like a regular from day one. Not only that - one night when a particular man wouldn't leave me alone despite me telling him I had no interest in what he wanted Isaac stepped in and deftly helped out. I have been in this situation a few times in my life but this is the first that I had someone in the other side of the bar step in and intercede. I don't think if Isaac hadn't that the drunk guy would have left me alone. For that I am especially grateful."

                "description": "Decent food for a hotel restaurant and our waitress, Amy, was great. We ordered the Q trio (chips, queso, guac, salsa), Brisket Sandwich, and the Citrus Winter Salad. The q trio was good, salsa was better than expected. The brisket sandwich is large and was a little too saucy for my tastes but still good. The winter salad was a little too bitter, however. We also ordered a mojito and a margarita, both were strong but good. Overall, decent experience for a hotel restaurant though it's a bit overpriced."

                "description": "This is their pasta bowl. At least 1/4 of it was jalapeÃ±os. The serving size was very small. They weren't sure if they should use fettuccini noodles or macaroni noodles so they just used both. Heck, why not. The taste was horribly bland. This tiny little box of pasta cost about 30 bucks after tax. It honestly looked and tasted like they went to random downtown restaurants and asked them to throw any leftover scraps from plates in this box and called it a meal. I don't honestly know how they could possibly serve this.  I wouldn't even serve this to my trash can."

We saw the fried quail with waffles and the mudslide dessert and that's all it took for us to want to try them out. Too bad both items are no longer available. Not cool.   The food: the sausage is extremely good here. Ribs have lots of flavor. The brisket is kind of dry but really different and good. The sides were okay. Cole slaw and beans. The bbq sauce is really spicy.   Also the burbon pecan pie had too much burbon in it. Jesus Christ! Also don't be cheap! Use blue bell vanilla ice cream   Atmosphere: great place to have drinks and eat dinner. Also nice place to catch a game. They also validate your parking.   Management why do you all change the menu so much? I really want to try the fried quail and waffles. Can you all add that back to the menu? Thanks"

                "description": "This is definitely a solid lunch spot. It is a little on the pricey side for lunch but, it is within a hotel. That's is to be expected. I always get the Pasta Bar option. You can add your own pasta sauce or mix and match. (I mix the marinara and Alfredo) It's $15 and you get unlimited made to order pasta, salads, and a ton of dessert options. The $15 covers all soft drinks and tea as well. It's a nice spread for sure.  The pasta is pretty delicious but sometimes they can make it a little on the oily side. I recommend asking for light oil, with the pasta chef.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the offerings.   Overall, if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks it's a great option!"

                "description": "Q Kitchen did some things really well and others not so well, so the \"A-OK\" rating is appropriate.  We had dinner at Q on a Monday evening.  The dining room area was closed, so we had to sit in the bar.  We had my 7 year old son with us, but the server advised us that children were permitted in the bar area until 9 PM.  We were able to sit in a corner booth that was furthest away from the action, but be aware that this is a bar so depending on how crowded it is you may not want to eat here if you have young children with you.  To start, we had the queso and salsa trio.  These were largely misses.  I would say the verde was the best of the dips, but that is not saying much.  The guac was basically mashed up avocado with a hint of seasoning.  Non tomato, onion, cilantro, peppers, etc.  The queso was too thick and made with processed cheese.  I would not order the dips again.  To eat, I went with the salmon sandwich and housemade potato chips.  The potato chips lacked seasoning and in some spots were not very crunchy.  The sandwich, on the other hand, is the reason for the 3 star review instead of 2.  The salmon was cooked very well.  The BBQ glaze was flavorful and a bit sticky.  The veggies were fresh and the aioli was flavorful as well.  There was quite a bit of excess bread due to the size of the bun, but I just ripped that off.  Very good sandwich, I would order this again.  Service was good throughout, our server was quick with water refills and very friendly.  No issues here.  The beer list wasn't great, but it had some Texas favorites on it.  I was certainly not blown away by our meal at Q, but it definitely had its high points and is a decent enough hotel bar/restaurant."

I find that the place goes through furniture identity crisis.  I have seen the place go from semi-comfy sectional furniture, to uncomfortable bar tables and chairs, to oversized chairs with dining tables, to the now deep-seated sofas and very low side chairs with high tables for eating.  I wish they could figure this furniture thing out.  For a bar too, there is harsh bright lighting from the elevator area."

So from the river  you would walk into the Hyatt Hotel and go to the 2nd floor up to the Q Bar Kitchen. Open air bar with large windows you can actually see out to the river. If you are staying at the hotel the lobby check in is on the same floor.   NICE!"

There's live music on the weekends too. The bar area overlooks a nice indoor river area and you can relax while listening to the water go down the indoor water fall. There's never a wait and it's way less crowded than most of the places on the river walk- although because the all glass facade you still feel like you're dining on the river. The escape from the humidity is an added plus as well.   For our last night in San Antonio, we decided to have dinner here. Great prices and good portion sizes as well. The service (we had Tina several times) was fantastic as well. Certainly recommend this not-your-average hotel bar/restaurant!"

Will be back for dates on future S.A. visits for sure!  Most places along the RW are tourist traps, with food typically ranging from mediocre down to hog feed. It's typically not very good and often downright awful, and you always overpay. Q Kitchen Bar had STELLAR food with personable and cool employees, a good vibe, and primo location.  The honey ribs - YES! Like dessert. Sweet and savory with a little crunch. Fantastic. The quail ... wow, amazing. SO good. I think of quail as lacking enough meat to be worth the effort. This was fantastic and left me wanting more. (The problem with quail: not enough!) And the queso fundido... to even call it queso is a stretch. It was a magical dip, to die for - liquid brisket and cheese and other magical ingredients with the perfect mix of seasoning... I ate waaaay too much. Wifey had to roll me out of the place.  Excellent beer selection. Plenty of local and Texas offerings.  Meeting the chef and chatting with her was the icing on the cake. She was awesome and clearly skilled at her craft. Cool lady for sure.  This place was great. Great food, great staff, cool vibe. Highly recommended!"

Acenar is right on the River Walk, so it is easy to take a stroll afterwards and see the lights (during holiday times) or just enjoy the area in general.  The appetizers are extremely good at Acenar and I highly recommend getting the guacamole which is freshly made, as it should be.   The menu is consistently very good, though there are some oddities like white rice instead of spanish, but in general this place is solid for dinner when down at the River Walk."

                "description": "We got a late start on dinner because my son graduated from the Air Force BMT. We were staying at a hotel near by the Riverwalk. This was literally the second place we came across.   We walked in off the Riverwalk it was about 9:15 pm. The hostess greeted us and sent us to dine at the bar level. She never said anything about hours of operation. We went upstairs and sat at a table across from the bar. We had been seated for about 10 minutes, no acknowledgement or greeting... nada.   I decided to go to the bar so the male bartender, with a beard would have to acknowledge me. He's making drinks; not acknowledging my presence.   I finally said \"excuse me sir, I was told we should dine here in the bar. Is that correct?\" The guy didn't even make eye contact with me. It was like I was an interruption.. bad attitude and customer service. He said yes we could eat there but we'd have to go up to the bar and order from him. The guy didn't even offer us menus.   My daughter was able to get some paper menus off the bar and we sat down to decide what to order. We decided to order the skirt steak for two with some guacamole.   The guacamole was great. The tortilla chips were warm. The skirt steak was some of the worst meat I've had in my life. It wasn't grilled it was more like steamed and gray in color. The meat didn't have much flavor to it. The only seasoning I could taste was pepper, it lacked salt. I was highly disappointed, especially for the price.  We would have to keep getting up and down to ask for drinks and every time it felt like a chore. This guy did not want to deal with us and it showed. He was very happy attending to his customers sitting at the bar. Once we got our bill, on the receipt it said Oba. If I was the business owner I would've fired this guy on the spot.   To make matters worse when we decide to leave we go downstairs to the Riverwalk entry. There are two gentlemen down there one of them an average to shorter height Hispanic man. He asked if we were visiting and if we were enjoying our visit. .. then he started asking where we came from and how long we were staying and it would be coming back to the restaurant or not. In the beginning it seemed hospitable. Then all of a sudden the tone changed... he started following us outside to the patio and chased us to the stairs. He kept saying he hope to see us again. As soon as we got down to the Riverwalk walkway he started making cat calls and telling us how beautiful we were very beautiful.  It was very unprofessional and creepy. The whole time I'm praying this guy would slither away. I have never felt so uncomfortable... He should be fired as well for being inappropriate and unprofessional.   Honestly the highlight of this restaurant was the homemade guacamole... Nothing else the service was awful. The food was over priced and poor quality. I would definitely recommend dining with a male friend or large group....If there was no other place to eat. I probably would've had a better experience at Taco Bell"

Next , We ordered Appetizers: Ceviche and Guacamole for 2  -- They make the Guacamole FRESH right before your very eyes !!!! Super Delicious! Then the Ceviche - wife says it's the best she's had in years.  Unfortunately...we were too full for Entree's.  Far and Away the BEST FOOD we've had in SA so far!! A side note, our Waiter was Gomez- Wow !! Ended up being a Great, light, lunch.  Satisfied, but still able to walk the River Walk afterwards.  BTW, there are many delicious sounding Entree's. :-)"

I ordered a glass of sangria, chips and salsa to start. The tower of chips was impressive and I barely made a dent in them before my three enchilada plate came to the table. The three enchiladas included: queso, mole and verde. The enchiladas were all very flavorful and delicious. The restaurant was quite crowded and service was a little bit slow, but understandably with the number of people. The mariachi band started up and entertained some of the larger parties. It's a beautiful setting on the Riverwalk and it was a nice evening for outdoor dining."

                "description": "For me, this restaurant put an upscale twist on Mexican food. The salsa was a smoky flavored brownish flavor and look. Like a chipotle flavor type of salsa. They screwed up on our order by putting the sauce on my wife's shrimp tacos and I got cheese enchiladas instead of ground beef. Everything could have been better in my opinion. However, our services was good and server was polite and took food care of us."

I ordered the 16oz Coconut Margarita which was excellent but not sure it had much Tequila???  I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas for dinner which were great. Little strange to have white rice instead of Spanish Rice but it was good with the sauce on the Enchiladas.    Would love to go back and try some of their other items!"

Their hot sauce has a smoky flavor. They use for roasted tomatillos.  Their Chalupa's Compuestas are fantastic. I prefer the chicken.  Everything on the menu is great. There's a La Pina your margarita that is also top notch! And you're sitting right on the river. Same owners as Rosario's in San Antonio. Our favorite place in town."

                "description": "You'd think for the price that you're paying that they would be better able to accommodate modifications. I asked for something with no onions (I'm sensitive to fodmaps), and the server told me that basically every dish had it and everything is premade or premixed by the hour. The server was at least very friendly and attentive.  The food was actually good. The Alambres appetizers are on the chewy, tough side, but they remind me a lot of fajitas. I really liked my molÃ© enchiladas, and I feel like this menu is very faithful to Tex Mex dishes while still being elevated. A lot of upscale Mexican restaurants are more geared towards authentic Mexican food. If you are a tourist wanting to eat something representative of San Antonio cuisine, this is a good spot!"

We had a really large group and they were so accommodating and professional.   The food was also absolutely DELICIOUS. I had to get the enchiladas with mole, and it did NOT disappoint. It was everything you'd hope for--nice flavors with the filling, the rice and beans incredible, and the mole a nice, dark, spicy yet sweet sauce that drove the whole dish home. I wished I could've eaten three or four more but I was pretty full after just one, which was nice on my wallet.   I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area, even if only for that mole sauce!"

We had the Oyster appetizer to start which was yummy and a feast for the eyes as well. I got the Chipotle Chicken and my boyfriend the Acenar combo which were both delicious. The sauce on the chipotle chicken was amazing! Our server was Gilbert, who was very attentive  and helpful. Only con is having to pay for chips and salsa, but hey, it was delicious (same as Rosarios salsa which is my all time fave)."

                "description": "As a Houstonian traveling to San Antonio, we wanted to find a romantic restaurant on the river walk for the evening.   After checking on Yelp, we found Acenar which seemed covid friendly and romantic (had outdoor seating, river walk access, and multiple vegetarian options).   We made a reservation beforehand just to make sure we had a spot when we arrived. It did seem that the outdoor seating was busy however indoor seating looked like it had a limited capacity. There was no dress code, people were in t-shirts, shorts, did not seem to dress up.   First thing I noticed was some of the employees had masks under their chin or nose. Second thing- there were no chips and salsa like a typical Tex Mex restaurant. This restaurant seems like it aims to be a fusion, high-end, hipster Mexican restaurant however it fails to do so.   We ordered the classic margarita jumbo size which was around $20. Not worth the price. Jumbo size did not seem much bigger than the regular size. I rather pay less for the regular size.   For food, I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas which came with black beans and white rice. The food came out in a timely manner. The vegetarian enchiladas seemed almost vegan. Inside the enchiladas, there was no cheese and shredded vegetables. The sauce was tomato based. There was nothing unique or special about the black beans. The white rice tasted like there was butter or something creamy in it (was different than what I was used to).   Overall, this is an average place. Because I don't live in San Antoinio, I most likely will not be coming back."

But Pam's handled my crummy attitude with patience and grace and I've gotta say, that made a difference and snapped me back into the reality that everyone is short staffed these days, and while there are some places that are blaming other, Pam's is just rolling up their sleeves and getting it done!  As for the food, this is hands down our favorite restaurant in San Antonio. The takeout is always amazing and filling and the variety leaves no one unfed (three picky kids), but even with this variety, every menu item is spectacular. When we do dine in, this place is so versatile - it can be a fancy date night, a casual lunch, or an evening out with three loud kids. The food is always fresh, creative, and delicious, the service is always on point, and the beer and wine selection has something for everyone.  Thanks for staying open throughout the pandemic, glad we can be customers!"

I was originally told they were fully booked but then the guy came back and said we could have a table that didn't have a reservation until 7... I was confused as to why it was an issue but not worried about it enough to change places since the rest of our group was driving to meet me.   Like many places, they have replaced menus with small pieces of paper with QR codes on them. It is an easy modification since almost everyone has a smart phone with a camera that can use this kind of technology. There was one for drinks and one for food.   Bread was brought out in a paper bag so it was covered and had minimal hands on it that we could see.   Staff was masked the whole time. And wore the masks correctly (it goes over your nose too).  One waitresses was busy spraying and wiping down surfaces throughout out time there.  There was hand sanitizer by the door inside since you had to go inside for the restroom. Staff were wearing masks inside too.  The food was fantastic and the service was good. Our poor waitresses, we got so caught up in catching up that it took a while to even look at the menus.   Everything was full of flavor and extremely filling. The salsa for the tacos is not for those with faint taste buds.... The Pad Thi looked and smelled amazing. If we get to go back soon, that is what I'm getting...   Tip: want to share a dish? Just ask for an extra plate and divide the food yourself, otherwise there is an up-charge. The transparency from the waitress in regards to this policy was greatly appreciated. The Pad Thi serving is large enough to split this way."

Ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and it was very fresh and tasty. We also ordered the chicken Tinga nachos...wow! Very very tasty. We shared the chicken saltinbocca, and if I would've been so full I would've eaten it all myself. I thought it was going to be heavy and too much, surprisingly it is not.

Don't order this on a first date unless you're cool with it being the last date.   The desserts are also amazing, you really can't go wrong with any of them.   This month is restaurant month so I might just try what they have on that menu. Right now, it's take out and curbside only. Give it a try!

Rick makes you feel like you're his bestie. It's a family environment, through and through. The patio is amazing! If you're on the fence, DO IT. For lunch, the spicy Hawaiian is my favorite. For dinner, the nachos are amazing. It's all good. Order whatever. It'll be worth it! 10.5/10"

I ordered the spinach and tomato on focaccia and it was good-might have been better with a little seasoning, but so glad they were willing to accommodate a vegan diet. The chips and mango/avocado salsa is so amazing! I hear they have a vegan taco option for dinner and looking forward to coming back to try!!"

My husband and I had an early dinner at Pam's  last Friday and while the food was good, not spectacular but good, they have definitely raised their prices. We don't mind paying for good food and can handle slower service but escalating the price for poorer quality food or quantity will not do it. We ordered two desserts to take home because they make great cakes but when we got home we took out two very small slices that costs $7.50 each.!!! RIDICULOUS!!  So raise your prices but serve the same quality and quantity as before. IT DOES MATTER !!WE WONT BE BACK !!!"

The restaurant has a relaxing vibe of casual wine dining. I really wanted to enjoy my experience more, however, the food was not impressive. We started with the chicken tinga nachos, then we ordered the shrimp tacos and pad Thai. Everything was just kind of ok and edible. Our service was disappointing and wait time was a bit much. I can't say that I would go back. If I can suggest improvements ...maybe faster food delivery.  Atmosphere 5 stars  Service 1 Star  Food 2 stars  Cleanliness 5 stars  Overall 2.6 stars"

We would probably suggest 1 - 12 inch pizza per person if everyone is hungry but 3 was fine.   Service was pretty slow and there was a wait despite tons of open tables. I think they are short staffed and was close to closing time. They also rushed us a tad and started to clean the carpet right next to me as I tried to multitask eating my last slice and paying for the bill they rushed.   Five stars for the food, Three for the service but I'll give the benefit of the doubt there."

Pizzas were really delicious and tasty! I love their crust and how thin they make it, I love when I can eat more slices without it being a ton of bread.  The middle was a bit soggy with the meat pizza so maybe getting it extra crispy is the trick.  Service was good and food was quick to come out. I'll be back!"

The rest had barely any toppings which was sausage on ours. Cheese was sparse and didn't cover the majority of the pie. I can't believe they'd put such a pathetic pizza in a box.    I'd give zero stars if I could.     My son and his GF just moved to San Antonio and wanted to try it since it was near their apartment. I am moving their also. I won't be going there ever again. I was just fleeced out of $30 and it pisses me off.    You want a real pizza with a load of toppings - check out Flying Pie Pizza in the Pacific NW. Hell, my homemade pizza kicks ass on this pathetic place.    Skip this place a go elsewhere."

The wait was 2 hours (!!!!) but they were doing a good job of pivoting to takeout for people who couldn't wait. We had our pizzas in 20 minutes (they're on the small side - grab an extra if you're unsure). They were absolutely delicious, the crust was amazing, the sausage on the pig love pie was really tasty. We got drinks to go and the sweet girl behind the counter had a great attitude, especially for someone who was absolutely slammed with orders. They did seem to have limited seating, but the park nearby had plenty of tables for our to-go order, and kept the kids occupied while we waited."

I didn't go check their shipping receipts to make sure they were from Italy but they tasted very fresh and I honestly believe them. We had the ricotta al forna and the margarita pizza and both were exceptional. Great cheese and hand pressed dough. Highly recommend checking this place out. Prices were also reasonable considering the quality of the food.   Overall: 4.75 stars   Pro tip: ask for the gargonzola dip, it was very solid"

We got the Ricotta al Forno to start and it was so light and creamy on the perfect toasted bread. Then my husband and I shared a large Margherita pizza with half house made sausage. The crust was just how they do it in Italy--so light and perfectly crusted. 5/5 for sure!!  PRO TIP: dip the crust in the ricotta if you have leftover, and ask for a side of the Gorgonzola blue cheese dip (if you're a Ranch dipper!) to dip pizza in but it definitely doesn't need it!!!"

The food was delicious, always fresh ingredients, and the service was outstanding and on point. The waitress/server for our table at the time, Bailey I believe was her name, was energetic, humble, and would make us feel right at ease as she provided us with quality service while we were dining in at Dough the downtown location. Thank you Dough and thank you Bailey for making our evening much more pleasant we will return again."

We recommend the fried mushrooms, they are just superb.The Sirloin Steak and pork chops are delicious plus the baked potato was perfect. We also enjoyed the salad bar.

The Alamo Burger has the nacho fixins infused into the patty, bacon and spicy ranch dressing all served on homemade sourdough bun. So good! Cora's is a great places, with awesome service and a down home atmosphere.  On Thursdays you can sit outside and listen to live music."

                "description": "Late post... but after living in the area for over 2 years passing by all the time we finally decided to try this place out! Its nestled on a small farm road out by all the fields, it has a play area for kids outside.   Walk in and greeted right away by the sweet ladies that stand at the desk. We always choose to eat in the dining room since there's AC in there!    Service has been great both times we have been, they have a young lady make you a salad of your choice and they nice about piling toppings on if you want them!  The nachos here are just ridiculous!! So good so tasty with all the toppings, I could go back just for those! But we've have fried fish, burgers, CFS, and steak here! All which were great!  We'll definitely become regulars here at Cora's!"

Super sweet but delicious with the ice cream on the side."

Most of the time we have to get a carry out as it covers the plate.   Lots of covered seating as well. Their open hours can be a small challenge, but no more than other places.  They have a small band play on Thursday nights I think."

                "description": "8/29/2021 the beer battered mushrooms are top notch! I would definitely return for the mushrooms. I also ordered the homemade chicken tenders..sadly the batter did not have any seasoning whatsoever. I went ahead and let the manager know about the lack of seasoning ...the tenders cooked to perfection and very tender..a good thing. i told her...she seemed very offended by me letting her know about the unseasoned chicken tenders i went ahead and added salt and pepper to them...instead of appreciating me letting her know she said \"we haven't had a complaints\"..i told her\" some people don't like to speak up but I'm doing it because that's what I would want for someone to tell if our food wasent seasoned..she rolled her eyes and continue to deny my issue on the matter. She said \"oh our customers let us know\" i told her \"well not today they didn't\"..to top it off she threatened my 75 year old dad and my self that she might have to move us to a smaller table if she had a large group come in which i agreed my did doesn't like boths and all the tables were being used. So we choose to sit in one of the large tables towards the back.... Management was very rude and unprofessional. wasent even asking for them to be remake or a refund the chicken tenders just letting her know..she could have taken the constructive criticism and fixed the issue with there tenders ..simple mistake but she could have handled that a lot better."

I really wanted some tasty Mexican food, I ordered cheese enchiladas. Disappointed when I realized they used American cheese instead of Cheddar and chili sauce instead of red. I will try again and order something more \"diner traditional\". Their posted hours were 5pm-10pm but they actually closed at 9pm. We were surprised when the lights were off and we were still sitting there!"

Nachos came out on an old cafeteria platter (I'm ok w that- kind of goes w the small town vibe) but honestly this was supposed to serve a bunch of people. I'm not even sure there was a full bag of chips thinly spread across the platter. It was meh at best. Service was not good- unless you know the waitstaff- which we did not. We live trying new local places but won't be back. Another one and done for us."

My group ordered the nachos and they were quite tasty.   I had the crispy beef tacos and they were well seasoned and the taco shell was nice and crunchy. My friends had the burgers, fries and onion rings. The burgers were a good size and my friends liked them both. The fries were a miss as they were very greasy but the onion rings were the bomb. Not greasy and very crunchy.  Overall the staff was friendly and the food was good.  I would recommend stopping in if you're on your way into/out of Castroville."

We had cheese nachos(excellent; just American cheese and jalapeÃ±os, broiled to perfection), pepper steak was the best out of the group. Also had chicken fried steak (good, but I wish one of the side options was mashed potatoes; instead I opted for baked potato over fries). Salad bar was crisp and cold. Chili taco was meh, a bit of a mess  because it looked like a casserole instead of a taco.  Peach cobbler was a little doughy and wish we had not gotten ice cream smothering it.

As the server was clearing our plates my 5 year old told the waiter I was 44 and the waiter said with a laugh, \"I don't care.\" I looked at him and said are, \"Are you kidding me?\" He immediately said he was sorry and tried to say he was joking, which he clearly wasn't. I told the manager on the way out what happened and was told he was very sorry about the experience. Never offered to take care of anything. After reading reviews, it is very clear their customer service is lacking and needs to be addressed. Just a suggestion for your first lesson on customer service, How to address kids at the restaurant."

Food was good but nothing wowing us enough to come back. Our server Manny was amazing and took great care of us during our visit and is a big reason for the 3 stars.  Drinks: Had a subpar dirty martini and Moscow mules during our visit. Moscow mules won over the martini as it just wasn't tasty or as clean prepped as I've had at other locations. Moscow mules were on the sweet side and could have used more alcohol but it was nice to sip on.  Food: Started with the fried asparagus and while they were good, we have just had better. If you've never had them before, highly recommend but if you're trying to fill a craving, I don't think these are the ones. Birthday boy had veal Parmesan and loved it. Said it was some of the better veal he had had since living in Texas the past 8 years. I had the Scuzzi shrimp dinner. Thought it was good but it needed more salt and sauce. I would have preferred the coating on the shrimp to be a bit crispier but that's just me. While we didn't order or request a dessert on our own, they provided the birthday boy a mini cannoli with a candle. Loved the thought and appreciation but I later found out they charged me for it. I didn't bring it up bc I understand businesses are trying to recover but I would have preferred the option to decline if I had to pay for it. It definitely put a damper on the experience so we probably won't return anytime soon."

Everyone ordered a few appetizers to share...they were your typical Italian fair like bruschetta, spinach dip, and fried calamari. Everything was pretty average and underwhelming. For my main meal I opted for Scuzzi's California salad with pan seared tuna add-on. The salad was just ok...I did the enjoy the pine nuts on it though. The tuna was a little fishy, but thankfully seared properly, although lacking much flavor. The best part of my meal were the 2 glasses of crisp house white, which made me temporarily forget how much I was spending on this super mediocre meal.  With so many other delicious Italian places in the city, I will not be back here."

Chairs were touching one another cause the restaurant crammed everyone together like sardines in a can...no elbow room. Food was lack-luster, bland, frozen Italian food. One waiter working hard, one with an attitude and a brand new bartender that didn't seem to get help from manager or coworkers. He did his best.  And the worse part of the whole Christmas dinner was eating off of paper plates. Sad. Won't be back again."

And they will split and give extra sides for only $3.   My favorite is the Gorgonzola chicken.  Then today I ordered a different chicken dish with squash and lemon butter sauce and now I can't decide which was better.  Such a hard decision for next time.   Their patio is beautiful and has a wonderful view of the city.  Also a nice breeze.  Try it out."

I had alfredo pasta with grilled scallops and my guest the Rainbow Trout.  We both loved the flavors and the attentive service.  I would have preferred to have the scallops be fresh, but we are land locked in the heart of Texas.  My guest took advantage of the $5 martinis on Thursdays and I had a most excellent old fashion.    I rarely have a bad meal here and I caught myself asking why don't I come here more often?"

The service was exceptional, waiter was very attentive and courteous which is why I rate this place at a four star for the most part. The food was moderate, my wife ordered the chicken Parmesan and I order the beef lasagna. The lasagna was soft, cheesy and tomato was ok no too impressed and my wife chicken crusted Parmesan tasted great the noodles and tomato sauce was ok. Overall not too impressed with the food however they do excel at service!"

No olives and the caesar dressing was not good. Will I go back?  yes. Just will not get the salad and the bread which they give you had no taste. Always give them a second chance.

We were celebrating a birthday and decided to bring a cake of our own (typical) we asked if they could keep it in the fridge to stay cold because it had fruit on it, then our waiter proceeded to say we will be charged $1.00 each for serving our cake? Talked to manager who wasn't very friendly and said we were being charged because we are using their plates and forks. Ridiculous! We also noticed our waiter was being rude to other servers continuously. The food was definitely overpriced and for the portions we received! I was expecting flavor for $23.00. If you're planning on coming here just keep in mind this business is all about the money."

As a foodie great food but I was over charged on my check the manager gave me the hardest time ever. Happy hour was 4-7 we ordered at 620 because our reservation was at 6pm and they rang the check in at 7:04 per what the check stated! He didn't even want to refund me after over charging me. I wish this was a better experience but it wasn't for all my people wanting the best service and food stick to Pompeii! I should have never cheated on my favorite Italian restaurant in San Antonio for this. 4 shrimp for $17.00 ohh hell no!  Please don't ever contact me or any customer for that matter via personal line/text that is just against all ethics to continue to rant about what I said on this site. A customer review is feedback! The thing is I still tipped in cash next time include all the facts!   I really would like to know why wouldn't you offer an opportunity to make it right next time, let the customer know you will always provide superb business. Nope that was not the case! This has now become harassment! It just food people!   Ps I'm not even a food critic! They are much worse!"

They were busy though but they maintained their cool during the entire time.  It was our 1st time there and our waitress Illissa was very helpful and patient with my dad's order.  He wanted gravy for his mashed potatoes  Their bread was soft and tasty, could have more olive oil for dipping though.  They have a great wine selection.  Their salads are huge and fresh.  We then decided to get the dessert menu. Saw that they had crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, I had to order it of course! Illissa reported that they don't do the flame on dessert anymore for show. Which is fine by me, just get me my dessert.   Dessert was brought and it 4 slices of strawberries around the dish, i was expecting an array of different berries.  Then proceeded to break the hardened caramelized sugar..... The custard was runny like pudding,  it was not solidified at all. Don't know if it skipped a step or what happened.  It tasted good but it was not in the form it was supposed to be.  Asked Illissa to please take it cause I couldn't eat that. She apologized and removed it from our tab.  Not her fault at all. However,  I would return for the main entrees, but leery of the dessert menu."

The baked oysters were great and their beet salad is a nice touch. The shrimp and lump looked amazing and came in a pool of butter, it's nice but was annoying to run into little shell pieces when you bite down.

We got complimentary bread and butter and shortly after our Calamari strips arrived. They were so delicious, crunchy, and soft in the center! Even the marinara was great not just tomato sauce!   We both got Redfish, I got the Pontchartrain and my wife the Diablo. The Pontchartrain was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, the Diablo was pretty bland and no spice at all! The dirty rice was average just seemed like it was out of a box...   Would definitely go back and try other dishes."

I always know what kind of meal it is going to be early on, and when we were given warm bread and a tasty olive oil dip, I knew we were in for a treat!   I had the Louisiana Lemonade and it was one of the top 5 cocktails I've had so far; my entree was a plate of oysters, shrimp and fries- all fried and it was so obviously fresh and seasoned to perfection. I'm very picky about my seafood and this restaurant is definitely on the top of my list of places to revisit!   Bourbon St. seafood is a must if you're visiting San Antonio!"

This place definitely hit the spot. It came with the softest bread and the most unique cilantro-infused oil that was delicious. The noodles and shrimp were cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of cheesy sauce. The portion was a pretty good amount (enough for 2, but I wanted to be a pig, so I ate the entire darn thing...and I have zero regrets). If getting takeout, the restaurant is sweet and adds a York peppermint patty. I don't really do chocolate and mint, but the gesture was really cute.   Highly recommend for taste and promptness. Totally worth the price."

The food is delicious but a tad overpriced and not quite as \"authentic\" as advertised. The dirty rice was more of a darkened rice pilaf than actual Louisiana dirty rice. The group I was with ordered a varied array of dishes and we each enjoyed the food. The order of frig legs that we shared as an appetizer was the BEST part of the meal, they weren't too heavily breaded,  as some restaurants do, and they were fried to perfection and still juicy and moist. I will recommend Bourbon Street Seafood Kitchen for fine dining with a Louisiana  flavor"

After bringing it to their attention, they brought her another cup and it was much better because they made a fresh batch. We requested an inside table due to outside seating was just too breezy.

This time wife and tried the Riverwalk location since we were in the area for an early dinner on Sunday 1/2/22. Took a minute, but we figured out the awkward parking and entrance after scouting/circulating the area back and forth. Parking was easy across the street at the hotel restaurant designated lot, but finding the restaurant entrance was a bit odd. The street side entrance is through INSide the hotel main entrance-weird. Even if you were walking the riverwalk path it's hard to even notice the restaurant is there. Once inside it's comparable to the Dominion. Intimate/nice but not overly fancy...this location has its own character. It was NOT crowded at all-which is a main reason for going. Carlos was our server and did a good job, but nobody was wearing a mask-really would have appreciated that. We are in a pandemic what's holding you back?  Protect you-protect me-protect your coworkers. Yes it's inconvenient, but it's the right thing to do during a pandemic. Thanks for considering. Alright to the food: wife had the trout (very rich and buttery) and I had the blackened catfish w/shrimp-great flavor. Both dishes were quite good overall. Sides and salads all well done too. Pleasant surprise the lunch menu was ON till 300 on a Sunday-can't beat that! Good experience overall will return, but won't go out of my way for this Riverwalk location-good enough if you happen to be in the area-especially for the excellent lunch menu value.  4 stars for the high quality of the food. Venue, no masks, and general quirkiness curtail the all elusive 5."

                "description": "We ate while in SA for a long weekend. The food was wonderful! We all ordered a different dish and there were no complaints. The spaghetti vegetables with my husbands dinner were perfectly seasoned. We all tried a bite and were amazed at how good they tasted. My blackened redfish was perfect, and served with dirty rice that was amazing. The others in our party ordered shrimp dishes that were cooked to perfection.   Leave room for dessert. The baked Alaska is big enough to share with several friends. Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e is my favorite dessert ever, and it was perfect. I'm not usually a fan of restaurant coffee because it's generally a dark roast, but their coffee was smooth and well suited with the desserts.   Definitely give them a try!"

Downside...pricey $100+ lunch for 2 adults and one kid, but the food was simply superior, and we were playing tourist, so we splurged.     We don't get a lot of good Cajun food in California...this place would have a line out the door 50 people long in San Francisco.  Not close enough to the downtown riverwalk action, but still, looks like a great, very clean, very tasteful hotel."

The food is amazing! Came here for a date night and it truly was the perfect place. Definitely a nice fancy spot with delicious food. Definitely recommend making a reservation.   Staff was so friendly and personable. I love that welcoming feeling the moment you walk into the door. Our waitress really knew the menu and even recommended delicious appetizers like the Calamari.   Price: fine dining pricey. So worth it though for those special occasions or if you really wanna treat yourself to something nice.   I'll be back for my birthday dinner next month."

                "description": "First off, I love Eddie Vs - Houston (Kirby and beltway 8), Palm Springs, Newport Beach, and Los Angele... iI've taken so many clients, friends, and family to the Houston Kirby location that the managers all signed a very nice birthday card for me in 2020.   Now for the criticism, I'm new to San Antonio, but my standards are those of the national Eddie Vs locations.... I've been here 3 times, twice at the bar, and once seated.   At the bar on my most recent visit, here were the main issues  1. Messy set up - super wrinkled napkins, uneven fold, plates not even put on napkins ...bartender had no regard for a nice set up 2. Same bartender started arguing with my client and guest over simple syrup in a cocktail. The maverick doesn't list that ingredient on the menu, my client doesn't like sweet cocktails, bartender surprised her with an excessive amount of simple syrup so she asked for a remake with no simple syrup. He kept saying that's \"just how the drink is made, not all the ingredients are listed\".... Just remake it without wasting time.  3. Same bartender was wearing a mask that doesn't cover his nose or mouth... I'm not a mask nazi, but food service should be doing this  4. Dirty plates everywhere. It was 8:30pm on a Tuesday, no one was taking dirty plates away. The folks to my left and right, as well as ourselves had were forced to stare at dirty plates... the floor where the bartenders were walking was dirty too.   Similar issues the other 2 times. I hate to say this, but out of the 5 EVs locations I visited, this is the only one I wouldn't come back to."

Stuffing could have used a little more sage seasoning a bit more than 1 tablespoon of cranberry sauce. However, they gave us more of everything when we requested, overall this was no problem.  This is our second visit and both times we found it to be delightful. keep up the good work in the reviews will keep coming in."

                "description": "I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars simply because their menu survived in tact with a name change. Can we get a relaunch  on the menu?  I decided to make this place for Halloween night because I knew I would be alone so I didn't want to be that guy who shoos away the kids or makes them walk all the way up the walk to get a thing of nerds. So I set 150 pieces of candy on the curb and bolted.   I arrived to the bar and promptly ordered their house special smoked old fashioned   https://youtu.be/d1iEBP9I2Nc  For bar food I ordered mini filet burgers. Center cut filet, blue cheese and onion jam. Very nice.   My entre was Texas Redfish with rice on the side. Perhaps just a hair overdone.   My bartender heard me say nothing was grabbing me from the desert menu so he orders me something custom on the house. I guess he knew once he did that, I'd be ordering a new old fashioned. This is why he's tending bar here and not Buffalo Wild Wings.   By this time I had switched to their standard old fashioned (12 less than 18). I've been annoyed by the lack of Bulleit Rye in San Antonio so I settled for Hayden's. I managed to hunt down two bottles of Bulleit Rye in town. Bartender suggested I covet those.   I always tell young couples looking for a serious date night to come here. It's rare for me to come here without being dragged by the wife.   If you're from MD and you know what real crab cakes are, all I can say is don't do it. No matter how much the staff brags on them, the MD style crab cakes are a forgery. They will disappoint you like accidentally kissing your sister."

                "description": "My dad and stepmom came to visit my fiancÃ© and I, and they wanted to eat somewhere good while they were here.  Eddie V's was suggested, so I made us a reservation.  I had never been to Eddie V's before, and it definitely did not disappoint.  Their food and service was fantastic.    We had shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, my fiancÃ© had the ribeye, my dad had the South African lobster, I had the scallops, and my stepmom had the sea bass.  We also ordered the crab fried rice, crispy brussel sprouts, and truffle macaroni and cheese for sides.  For dessert, my step mom and dad had berries and cream, and my fiancÃ© and I had the pineapple upside down cake.    The shrimp we had as an appetizer were nice and big, not to mention tasty.  I tired my fiancÃ©'s ribeye, which was cooked perfectly to his liking and was full of flavor.  I also tried my dad's lobster tail, it was sweet and very tasty.  I didn't try my step mom's sea bass, but she said it was amazing.  My scallops were sweet and some of the best I've ever had.  The sides were delicious too.  The truffle macaroni and cheese was bursting with flavor and my favorite out of the sides we ordered.  Probably the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had.  The crab fried rice and brussel sprouts were also amazing.    We also had a wonderful waiter.  He was very attentive and professional and even gave us some small samples of an appetizer they offer and a small sample of their bananas foster dessert they have.    My fiancÃ© and I have lived in San Antonio for about two and a half years, and Eddie V's is my favorite restaurant so far.  It is a bit pricey, but the food and service is totally worth it.  If you like good seafood and steak, I definitely recommend Eddie V's.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  I can't wait to go back.  I  am not sure if this is a reservations only restaurant or not, but I did make reservations for us, and I suggest making reservations if you go there."

There were five women, with one celebrating her birthday. He was very complementary of our looks (apparently, he claims women age better than men....I'll take it ). Other than his excellent service, we were also happy with our meals.   For our sides, we had the following:  Crispy Brussel Sprouts - **** Crab Fried Rice- ******  (amazing!)  Starters:  Wedge Salad - ***** Warm Goat Cheese Salad- **** Classic Caesar - ****  Main Entrees:  Norwegian Salmon - ***** Jumbo Gulf Shrimp- ***** Parmesan Sole - *****  Clearly, we were very happy with the food and the service. Icing on the cake was the surprise birthday trio that was presented to the celebrant. The petals on the table was an added and sweet touch to our experience.  So glad that I finally got to experience Eddie V's!"

                "description": "Five star service from start to finish.  Outstanding job to the manager (Mike I think?) and his team of service staff.  Reservations were relatively easy to grab late in the day on a Saturday.  As some have mentioned it's sort of a loud place but the decor and overall vibe of the place makes up for it.    The hosts were spot on, professional and saw us to our table promptly.  The waiter was very quick to recommend, share quick table conversation and most importantly pace the meal so that we had an experience that was remembered and not just in and out.   Food was above my expectations.  It was presented as described, with an excellent temperature and quality.  Plating, we all understand we eat with our eyes as much as our mouths.  Presentation here was without flaws, the culinary team really executed the meal preparation with professionalism and skill.    Desert was placed to go and we were given a small square sample of the bananas foster to go.  One bite, I'm hooked.  This was the absolute best bananas foster I've ever eaten and giving me a small square in my bag was the smartest thing to do.  Otherwise, I probably would have passed it by and never experienced it.  Seriously, if you like bananas you simply must go for the foster.  I have found my newest favorite desert.    Oh, our to go was chocolate cake which while good, it is really overtaken by how good the foster was.  The team here really put fourth a five star experience and served with passion and heart. My second visit is down, and I look toward many more in the future.  The word on the street here is they have a pretty amazing happy hour.  Definitely something to check out in the future.     Five stars for me my fellow yelpers, I recommend you give them a visit and prepare to elevate your evening."

                "description": "Very elegant restaurant. Polite staff but food was a bit underwhelming.  We ordered a few oysters on the half shell - a bit smushed onto a plate but definitely fresh. Strong horseradish - so be cautious if you don't want to lose the taste of the oysters.  Lobster bisque is poured over a small piece of lobster tableside which is a nice presentation but it does cool the soup a bit IMO. Needed a bit more salt to bring out the flavor. It was ok - nothing stellar - this is generally one of my favorite soups to order but alas this one was just ok  My DD ordered the Halibut which at first we were told was not available and we overheard a different server mention it as a special so we were able to locate ours to double check if it was really available and to change our entree order. It was done really perfectly - definitely would order this again  I was excited to see lobster mashed potatoes - so HAD to order this of course - I have had an excellent rendition of this in SF at Maestro's so was really looking forward to trying this one. Definitely steps and steps below. We ate the lobster on top - ok amount but the potatoes were just warm - not hot and the sauce (not just butter) didn't add to it all and there were chives throughout which really didn't work here. We didn't have much of this and didn't bother taking the leftovers home - which really never happens before - Leaving mashed potatoes is a very strange concept to our family.  Might be worth a second try if we our in the area but I won't be dreaming about coming back....."

Our table definitely looked different then everyone else - there was a Reserved card and it had fresh rose petals surrounding the centerpiece candle. Al was our server for the evening and he was so sweet and walked us through the specials for the evening and his favorites.  [Not pictures] My drink throughout the evening was The Hope's Diamond - gorgeous looking and delicious; can't taste the alcohol so be careful!  For dinner our entrees were the Lobster (my favorite place for South African Lobster) and the Filet Minon with crab stuffed shrimp.  No dessert for us as much as Al tried but it was a great evening dinner all around. I would highly recommend celebrating birthdays here."

My wife and I went for our annual Christmas dinner out to celebrate the evening, I made a reservation a week prior and upon arrival they set us at a high top table in the bar. We asked to be moved to the dining room and they accommodated our request. I don't have a problem sitting in a bar but when you make an 8pm reservation and get dressed up for a $300 meal you expect to have a nice place to sit. But to be fair, they allowed us to move and the rest of the evening was great."

                "description": "I like to sit at the bar when visiting Eddie V's restaurants and truly am on a mission to try every one, so I was very happy to see there was one in San Antonio, when I went for business recently.  The day I went, it was dead... I've never seen an EV's so not busy. Service was initially very attentive and prompt, but that seemed to decline as I enjoyed my first glass of wine, as it appeared the bartenders were busy restocking and working on getting off, even though I think I arrived around 7 or 7:30. I started with my favorite shrimp Cocktail anywhere and it was just as awesome as it is at the other locations. I opted for their Texas Red Fish, as I've never seen this on the menu at other locations. It was just \"OK.\" It was very underwhelming and had a nasty vein of dark meat running through the middle that was inedible. Another item I always get is their crab fried rice, it's usually the best fried rice anywhere! I wasn't impressed with this preparation of it at all. Something about it, it just didn't have the incredible flavor I'm used to. And the brussel sprouts had actual whole garlic cloves in it, not even sliced up... I found that to be odd, especially since I've gotten this before at other locations and don't recall this being the way it's prepared.  I don't recall getting waited on much in the last part of my time dining their that evening, so I requested the check, paid and left. I was going to return next week when I return for business again, but I'll be going to Bob's instead."

We went with shared appetizers and sides.   Service was amazing, and presentation of the dishes was good! I left SO FULL and really underestimated the portion sizes. One of the best meals I ever had. Filet mignon was perfectly seasoned, lightly salted, and very tender. I really liked the truffled Mac and cheese. The cheddar potatoes were good, but I expected au gratin to be more of a scalloped potato than cubes.  Will be back!!"

                "description": "Eddie V's truly has a delectable menu and fresh, delicious seafood. From the minute we walked in, up to the moment we paid the bill, the service was above and beyond.   My hubby and I went for a weekday date night and kept it light. We enjoyed some fabulous appetizers and the crab fried rice, which if you have never tried you haven't lived! Honestly everything was fabulous, the seafood is never \"fishy\" and it's cooked just right, never rubbery. This is one of our favorite spots for fine seafood.  The outdoor patio is pretty much where we always sit, it is well covered so you never have to worry about the sun beaming down on you. It's always best to make a reservation, and if you get a chance, sit at the chef's table!"

Long known for their seafood and great variety of wine they also do a lot of great steak options. Re the HH selection, the crab cake is the best and freshest u will get in SA! The spicy yellowtail sushimi cannot be beat and we also love their prime rib sliders! They also do a great job of chilling their wine which we can always use in SA even in Dec! U cannot go wrong w this place. The service was also impeccable! Thanks Eddie V"

They make  some stops along the way to get some food and bathroom breaks, since we can only use the bus toilet for #1 only. We are very satisfied customers and plan on going back again."

                "description": "My wife and I have taken 3 casino trips with OK Tours. The first time the I10 was closed and the detour made the trip last 4 hours longer.  The seats are okay for short distance but was very uncomfortable by end of trip. The last trip there was a driver and \"tour guide \".  The tour guide kept chatting up the driver and to my mind this distracted the driver.  This was evident when a wheel barrel blew off a truck in front of us.  In trying to avoid striking the object our driver swerved onto shoulder at fairly high speed but still hit the object. Very scary. On the way back she missed our exit and had to double back. I'm sure I will never get my wife on a bus again."

We had the A/C unit go off in over 105 degree heat. A young girl passed out and was unresponsive. And what did OK TOURS do??  They said let's stop here and let this young girl gather her composure and then we will take off. Well like I said that was over 6 hours ago. No one has offered to put us up in a hotel room...There are elderly folks out here in the elements. There are people asleep on the concrete sidewalks in the parking lot of a Love's. What the fuck is that??!! (Please excuse my language). But I have been more than patient with this sorry ass excuse for a tour bus company.   I am giving them a 1 only because it will not allow me to post if I do not select at least 1 star.   Sorry to some of the coordinators. They tried their best.

                "description": "I have been on a few bus trips from San Antonio to Coushatta Casino. I don't remember which company for previous trips, but if I go again, will make sure it is with OK TOURS. The bus was comfortable and the driver made sure we had all information needed. The driver or as I would like to call him, the Captain of our ship, was THE BEST! Captain Mark Cain was definitely the best bus driver ever! His driving skills were evident from the get go and I can honestly say, I felt confident and knew that he would get us there safe and sound (a major consideration for bus travel these days). So take away is: Request Mark Cain for your trips and you will be a happy traveler. And OK TOURS: Mark is deserving of whatever raises he is eligible for. Do whatever you need to do to keep him!! Happy Travels with OK TOURS and Captain Mark Cain!"

So for 2 people that would be 110.00.so when I checked my balance of my checking account they took out 130.00.so when I called I talk to one of the supervisor he was very rude.. So anyways he said he would put the 20 back. In my account but still ain't there. So rules of the bus is you can't have beer or no liquor.. The man that was sitting in the back was drinking beer and whiskey.. Very ignorant and very irritating. We got to the casino well we had to wait like 3 in half hours to get are room we got there at 2..the tour guy Jaime said he would be back at 530 to give us the keys to our room.  Well he was 30 min late we finally went to the room it was the Days Inn it was a dive.. The room was hot AC didn't work.. Carpet was dirty.. So we went back to the casino.. The staff at the casino are rude I had to go to the bar 7 times to get a drink wait staff was no good.. The casino look ghetto.. Stinks real bad.. on the way back the man that was drinking on the bus before well he brought liquor on the bus kept talking to me and my wife I told Jaime he was harassing us and told him he was drunk and drinking he didn't seem to do anything about it. He bought beer at the last stop and brought it on the bus right in front of Jaime and did nothing about it"

We had previously had a bad experience with one of their drivers and requested he not drive our kids on this particular trip.  Yet, this same driver was there on the 2nd leg of our trip home.  His driving continued to get worse as he drove.  Long story short, he was finally arrested and charged with 52 counts of DWI with a minor.  Two years later, the court case is finally over and he's now a convicted felon who will not be driving a bus ever again.  Not once during this time has OK Tours taken any sort of responsibility or returned any payments made even though they did not get us home safely.   We have scouts who will never be able to get on a bus again without checking to see if the driver seems sober.  (Bus on trip to Georgia also broke down leaving us with 50+ scouts stuck in a parking lot.)  OK Tours may be cheaper, but it is not worth the money you will save!"

I'll assume that to be true. Looked outside and saw the bartender having a smoke and putting on makeup. I walked outside to let her know about it and didn't request anything in return. She apologized and offered to reimburse my card (I paid cash prior to my finding and a 30% tip to which I should have taken back, but I did not).

                "description": "I went this past Sunday at lunch.  There were maybe three tables sat when we got there.  We ordered the onion rings appetizer.  They were very good except for the ketchup tasted spoiled.  We ordered three burgers where they charge you for the cheese and a different bread if you want it.  I chose the Jalapeno cheese bread.  After waiting about 40 minutes our waitress comes out and says they ran out of hamburgers but rest assured they were making some and ours would be fresh!  My family laughed and said, what had they not ran out would they not be fresh?  Needless to say and hour passed by and our food finally came out.  Trusting the yelp 4 start review I'm ready to eat!  Well my Jalapeno and cheese bun came out and it had no Jalapeno or cheese in it and it was the type that is old and falls apart and was fermented.  I almost asked for my $1.50 back for the upgrade but my family said let's just get out of here and forget about it and not come back.  So for $52 we received an order of onion rings and three burgers and no drinks.  A sign of the situation as well, the table next to us complained of the hot sauce for their tacos being spoiled.  Their 4 star review may have been earned in the past but this place is not something I will ever be looking forward to.  ****Update*****We used my Mastercard here to eat and didn't use the card anywhere else.  I've received two fraudulent charges on the card now.  A girl by the name Jessica used the card to buy pizza in Seguin."

It's a smaller restaurant with plenty of seating and a full bar (although pretty simple draft choices).  The prices are good, and the food is great! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on sourdough. It came out fresh and melted in my mouth. I can't say I have had a chicken burger this fresh and moist...ever! My husband got the Texan which was great as well- not too much bbq sauce and the flavors went together great.  While we didn't have room for anything else other than beer, I would definitely be back. Very dive bar feel with what seemed like 98% \"locals\" or return guests as everyone was mingling with the bartenders a lot. I am happy to say this didn't affect our service since the bartenders were the waitstaff as well.  Definitely check it out! Also karaoke on Saturdays!"

                "description": "This should be your new \"regular\" spot for lunch. The only problem is that it's already the regular spot for a LOT of people so you better start taking lunch breaks early.  I came with a work friend and got a decent table ala \"seat yourself\". Lots of burger options and that's what they are known for. I had the Texas burger on a bun. Usually, it comes on Texas toast (of course). It was ginormous and well done. The pile of bacon on it was - it amazes me to write this - almost too much. I think there was more bacon than beef. Also a couple onion rings and bbq sauce made this an awesome meal.  For a side I had the tater tots which were tasty and well cooked.   I would have liked speedier service, but the three women serving this place were flat out slammed and doing an impressive job of keeping up with the flow. So go, be patient, and don't fill the place up!"

Drawn in by the media buffet above the bar (football, football, football, Simpsons, football, football...something for errbahduh!), we parked it there.  There's a great list of pre-built burgers, but also a long list of carb jacket (definitely go for the jalapeÃ±o cheddar! Definitely. ) and topping choices from which to build your own. He orders the Australian burger and I beer, I go for a much more Texan option: chicken fingers and fries basket, white pepper gravy duh, and a sweet tea (Don't judge! We had just spent all afternoon at  brewery, and I hadn't eaten. Adultin' like a mofo!) The waitress was kind enough to suggest that the fries in my basket would be enough for both of us. ..\"*if* I felt sharing\", lol. Well played, ma'am! And much appreciated tip, seriously! ...and indeed they were. A very short few minutes later, a veritable mountain of food was placed in front of  us.  Burger: Super!! Chicken and gravy: Really really good. Fries: Old eff'n Bay!!! Yaaayyyy!  Sweet Tea : holy shit, use the lemon! Super sweet and delicious with it. Without citrus...drinking Karo sizzurp through a straw lol.  Bellies : full.  To-go box: also full.  Bartender: Badass"

Decided to try it out for Mother's Day. NOT for us. Burger was large, but very greasy and lacking in flavor. We asked for extra crispy sweet potato fries, I've had more flavorful and crispy sweet potato fries frozen out of a bag. Menu was a la cart, so we spent way more than we should have for in my opinion, poor quality food.  Customer service (if you can even call it that) was non existent. Will not go back. Pat's Place is definitely much better, unfortunately they're closed on Sunday's.  For the lovely folks letting their small kids scream and fight over the pool table, pool sticks/balls, AND use a stick with no tip on the felt, unsupervised, I'm thinking Chucky Cheese is probably a better choice next time."

                "description": "Today, for 8 hours, I've been thinking about downing a hand-formed, griddled hamburger. Where to go? My criteria: new place, no tips, local, inexpensive, and at least a 1/2 pounder,   There are not many places to get hamburgers over here. There is Smashburger, which has been getting horrible ratings, Chilis (my favorite), Texas Roadhouse, Gruene River Grill, the Phoenix Saloon, and Pat's place. Now, places where you can get away without paying a tip--whether that is through the drive though or takeout--are GG's Corner Cafe (Marion), Blakes's Cafe (McQueeney), Kirby's Korner (Seguin), the Longhorn Cafe (New Braunfels), and today's addition with Landa Station.     This dive bar is located about a block past Landa Park. While looking at their menu online, I noticed that all of their burgers are 1/2 pounders (plus); they have one pounders also, chicken sandwiches, and Mexican food (cool). This is a bar folks!  I went through the drive though, after phoning in my order 10 minutes earlier. I ordered a patty melt ($5.75) because I haven't had one since I was a teenager, ions ago. The patty melt was described as a 1/2 pound burger, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on a buttered, Texas Toast. I must have arrived 5 minutes too late because my \"toast\" was no longer toasted. Either it was not toasted enough, or it steamed in that Styrofoam box and turned back into bread.      The burger was huge, juicy, and was cooked medium, as I had ordered (plus), the onions were great; however, the cheese was a white cheese sauce, or poor quality cheese (I think the former). The cheese seemed almost like white cheese whiz. If these burgers could be improved, I would only serve Wisconsin cheeses. I would pay 75 cents more.  They also have chopped pork, chicken, and many burger combinations. Because of the price, the drive through, and hand formed burgers, I will definitely be back. Oh, and on Wednesdays, when you buy a burger, you get a beer for 10 cents (probably inside only)."

While the store is not big they have a good selection of liquor, beer and wine as well as mixers. This small yet well organized store makes shopping quick and easy. While their prices are a few dollars more than other chain liquor stores in town, I'd rather pay a little extra to support a locally owned business. Also, they offer a members club for a small annual fee, $25 I believe, and with that you get 10% off liquor and wine.   While there are other larger stores nearby, do yourself a favor and shop here; the staff is more friendly and knowledgable."

TABC required us to name a liquor store to receive our bottles, half went to Seazar's and half to a liquor store in Tempe, AZ. As \"Wine UnClub\" members at Seazar's we always get a discount on all our purchases. For this third barrel Mike decided to up the price per bottle to retail and not honor our discount club card. When we asked why the price was higher this time around we were told they were doing us a favor by handling the transaction at all. Even though I live in AZ I buy a lot of bourbon from Seazar's and I have many friends in San Antonio. You have lost my future business and I will make sure to spread the negative word about how you do business. We have several more barrels coming and they won't be going through Seazar's."

While there, a guy offered to let us try samples of like 5 of the new beers they had just gotten in. Pretty cool! Even cooler, the owner/manager guy.. (he calls himself Captain (something or other).. I forgot) offered to let us try two wines also. Apparently, every saturday there are free wine tastings of the featured wines.. He chooses good and reasonably cheap ones every week. There is even a group you can join to try them every week and get a discount on them.. Then, we returned for halloween and the owner basically showed off his vast knowledge of different alcohols by recommending various tequilas that were within our price range but also very good. Seriously, this guy knows his stuff and he doesn't try to rip you off by recommending the expensive product.. it's pretty awesome! GIve 'em a try!"

                "description": "While visiting another business nearby I decided on an impulse to purchase Vodka for Bloody Mary's I planned to serve for my husband this week-end. What a great decision! William was attentive, very knowledgeable and patient. He made some excellent suggestions and recommendations for Vodka and wine. I have been a wine collector for about two years and still have much to learn and I already know William will be one of my major resources. One of the biggest joyful surprises was he was able to find a case of my new favorite Chardonnay in their warehouse. I haven't been able to find this small production wine at any retailer online  and even the winery itself is sold out so this was a real find! I joined their wine club and since I live in the area my case was delivered the next morning when it arrived from the warehouse. You can't go wrong with these guys! Their prices are very competitive and with the 15% discount it becomes a lot easier to purchase the special selections. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"

I struggled with the item number and the write up because they did not always match up or it was hard to determine what the item number was.  We had a good time, a lot of stairs.   I will give more information when I go back. The first time was a quick hour walk through. So if you really like art you can spend all day there."

                "description": "How does one rate art? Just like anything else, it's about the $$ vs experience.  Parking is convenient...not free ($5) unless you're a member. There was some construction, so navigating wasn't the most fun. Service was superb at the front desk...just smiles and respect.  I really enjoyed seeing ancient artifacts and sculptures...esp the coin collection and Greek statues. There were literally pieces that are thousands of years old, even preceding the days of MOSES. Crazy!  I was a bit fan of the Chinese collections as well....however my 4 star is because of my huge disappoint at the Korean collection. It is labeled Korean so I expected a bit more than a few Buddha sculptures and pottery made in korea...thought it would be more of the culture. Oh well.  For $20, well worth it and lots of food options near by too. If you want to find something to do to spend your day but can't decide, then this is a great option to stroll around and enjoy someone else's hard work.  However, this is probably not a place you want to bring young children or strollers, I don't think the experience would be very pleasant with children around. It was pretty cool that they would allow us to take photos of stuff (without flash) so I get to capture some memories with my wife."

When we came to visit, the elevators were down. So if you have anyone who isn't mobile enough to go up and down the stairs I'd call first to see if they have any suggestions. It took a little over two hours to do a 'quick' run through the whole museum, I could have probably spend the day taking everything in. It's a great place to visit! Definitely would recommend anyone to stop in and get some steps in."

                "description": "If you had told me six months ago that I would find an extensive collection of Egyptian, Greek, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese artifacts in San Antonio, I would've laughed in your face, yet here I am - living right next door to the museum that houses just that.   I decided to check it out and ended up becoming a member (it's a good deal; $60 for a year-long all-you-can-visit membership with some free guests or $20 for a single visit unless you're military, a student, senior, etc.) and I'm already considering becoming a volunteer.  I'm not sure why the name is the \"museum of art\" because - as far as I've seen - it's mostly historical artifacts, or artwork from 1000+ years ago. Of course, I've only visited once so far so there might be a large section I'm missing but either way, it's a surprisingly large collection in a surprisingly nice museum. (And I know it might sound ignorant to think a museum like this wouldn't be in south Texas, but I had only seen such collections on the East coast of the US, or in capitol cities.)  Highly recommended to check out while you're in SA!"

                "description": "One of my first visits to SAMA was in the 1980s when my parents took me to a Jim Henson exhibit and I've been a fan ever since. I usually visit at least once, sometimes twice a year depending on exhibits. Parking across the street used to be free but they now charge $5 but members can can get validation. I feel like SAMA tends to get overlooked compared to the McNay. The McNay surpasses SAMA with the beauty of their grounds but SAMA also is located on historic grounds of a former brewery. This is the only art museum in town with an restaurant on the grounds out back by the river (the excellent Tre Tratorria) which is great so that you can see the entire museum with a place for replenishment. They still have an excellent and actual gift shop as compared to the McNay, which has significantly downsized theirs. I feel like the exhibits sometimes pale in comparison to those at the McNay but right now they have an excellent American Impressionism show and extended the very fun Movie Metal showcasing some of the Transformers and vehicles from Batman shows and movies and back to the Future. The museum is several stories tall so be sure to visit the level with the skywalk that many years ago was used to roll barrels of beer across. They also have very cool old-fashioned glass elevators. Free admission for Bexar County residents on Tuesdays and Sundays (check their site for hours).  If paying for parking make it worth your while and take a walk north along the SA River while viewing more art installations and head to the Pearl shopping and dining district and catch a ride on one of the river barges. There are several less expensive places to eat at within walking distance that are less expensive than Tre Trattoria and the Pearl such as Elsewhere and Rosella. You can also walk along the river towards downtown for coffee or rooftop cocktails and light bites at Paramour. For more art (that's free!) walk a few blocks along Jones towards I-35 to see murals painted under the highway."

On free days for any special exhibit there will be a $5 or more surcharge.   A few beautiful sections of the museum include. * Texas Artist and Texas Furniture  * African Artifacts * Roman Artifacts * European Art * American Art * Abstract Artist  * Modern and Contemporary Art  You can spend all day in the San Antonio Museum of Arts from reading all the information bulletins to exploring the various levels and artwork.

We got to see all the art displayed. The bad thing about it is the walking, if you don't like to walk, then this place is definitely not for you.  SA is full of rich culture and heritage. I think the museum did an amazing job at depicting Latin American/European art. If you are in this area, you should definitely check it out. The sculptures are beautiful and it gives you a better understating of what art is."

It's literally filled from floor to ceiling with tons of awesome paintings, artifacts, literally anything you could imagine. The place is very well organized and grouped by different countries. I feel like I see the same art at every other art museum but not at this place. There are so many stunning pieces that are indescribable, unique, and overall incredible. The facility was clean, it was quiet, it was just utter perfection when we were there. My family was able to learn so much and experience things we didn't think we'd ever see in person. There aren't enough words to tell you how incredible this place is. They have every type of art, from every type of place, and just wow. It's also located on the river walk, so you could take a nice stroll afterwards like we did. There's also a restaurant with tons of outdoor seating. I'm just in awe of this place. If you're in San Antonio you HAVE to check this place out."

                "description": "We are museum members who visit often, and here are some tips for new visitors.   A path through the museum. From the Great Hall (entrance lobby), turn left into the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman galleries. Take a ride in the glass elevator to the second and third floors with art from Asia, especially the ceramics from China and Japan. On the fourth floor, Australia and Oceania.   The skybridge is a must-see. It has a beautiful of downtown and the Pearl area. You can see many of the rooflines of the converted brewery building that became the museum.   The east tower is changing right now, but be sure to go to the Latin American wing to see colonial art, folk art, and ancient artifacts.   The museum store is in the bottom of the east tower and has books, postcards, toys, and more.   Checking the website will tell you what changing exhibitions are at the museum. On the way to the temporary exhibitions gallery, you will pass under a Chihy glass ceiling. You'll also find out what events are going on, whether it's a Friday night party for adults, or Sunday afternoon activities for families. The website also has up to date information on free hours and free days, often including the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas.   Along the river, there are coutyards for getting some fresh air, as well as restaurant space, currently occupied by Tre Trattoria. The Luxury (an outdoor restaurant) and Rosella coffee shop are just down the block.   This area of downtown is getting busier, but so far we haven't had a problem finding free parking. During Fiesta parades, however, the museum will close because it is so close to the parade route."

                "description": "DISCLOSURE: If you're a lover of art, or have no real interest, this place still has a bit of something for everyone. This can mean a getaway from reality to spend some time in individual contemplation about the ways of the world.  For others, it could be walking, exploring and catching up with a friend of old.  And for that person in need of ideas for a project for their class, the San Antonio Museum of Art is worth the time and day (preferably a free day, so look forward to those Tuesdays or if you're military just walk on in).   Trying to get a feel for a new community that I am slowly beginning to integrate into, it can be easy to drive by this place and not even realize the potential for adventure you'd be missing out on.  This is an instance where one could say \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" because straight up, being seemingly located in a more industrialized looking area, are two huge brick buildings connected by a glass bridge above the entrance. One would more than likely find themselves stumbling across this place realizing that they've found intellectually stimulating, creative brain splurges splashed onto canvases, molded into sculptures, and numerous other ways with the potential of draining your entire day away in the blink of an eye.    For starters, when you do get to the museum, parking is conveniently located directly across the street and the best part is it's free! If you're looking for shade, just park a little further back so that's helpful.  On your way through the parking lot is a little bit of teaser art that I don't think is associated with the museum itself but if you're looking for a shot for Instagram, consider this little jewel on your way to the treasure chest.   Walking into museum, you'll be greeted by smiling employees at the desks in front of you and along the right wall, so don't be afraid to ask questions about the break down of the establishment so you can organize your trip or adventure any way you'd prefer.  At first it can be confusing considering there are numerous centuries of world art divided between several buildings and four floors.  The exhibition available during my time there was 500 years of Spanish painting from museums in Madrid so check out the central building first to see what new exhibitions they have available.  Aside from these are American art, contemporary art, and my favorite would easily have to be art from Greece and Rome so I spent quite a time in that section.   Know that as in any art museum, keep conversational volumes to a low, be mindful of anyone analyzing a piece, and please do not let your kids touch anything (as well as some adults tbh).  The facility is clean, the employees will answer any questions that they can, so help them out and be a fantastic visitor!  When you're done, they have a nice little gift shop and if you're looking to save a few pennies, ask them to point you in the direction of the clearance items which are just as nice as the regularly priced items. This was a great experience and I will find myself coming back here for more brain food!"

A visit to SAMA was of particular interest to me as the former Director is the new Director of our Minneapolis Institute of Art.  The SAMA collection has a focus on classical Roman and Greek art and Asian Art. There is also an interesting collection of more modern art including a Texas art collection. There is not very much from Europe however so you shouldn't expect a lot of art from medieval times, the renaissance, or the French impressionists for example. The collections themselves are well presented in an impressive setting.  The building itself is located on the river walk and there is a nice restaurant attached. The SAMA is certainly worth multiple visits."

                "description": "Thursday night we decided to celebrate my wife's birthday,  since they do not take reservations and did not want to chance sitting outside waiting for a table we went at 5:30pm. We were able to park close and was seated right away. We loved the look and feel of the court yard and restaurant.  Cozy is how we described it. Our server was attentive and we passed on appetizers but order a bottle of French sauvignon blanc wine. Very good wine at a reasonable price point. We both ordered the 7oz loin steak. I opted for chicken tortilla soup, tasty thick soup but it was not very hot (Temperature). My wife had the salad with blu cheese dressing (good quality). We were pleased that our entrees did not arrive until we finished our soup/salad course. Again a point of proper service by our server. Our loin steaks were proper Temperature and had a great char crust. Great tasting. Green beans were fresh and cooked with still a bite to them. Roasted potatoes were nice.  For dessert we ordered black coffee that was fresh, cheesecake and a chocolate cake with ice cream. Desserts were very good.  We highly recommend and we return soon"

                "description": "My new favorite place in New Braunfels! I had a work meeting here and I was looking forward to eating at a restaurant that I have not been to before. I had seen all of the great reviews and even had some friends that Have recommended this place.  I love the decor and the house feel to this restaurant. We were seated right away and the service was top notch. I got the tortilla soup which I recommend and I ordered the steak with the port wine reduction sauce with blue cheese. I am picky about my steaks partly because I think I am pretty decent at cooking my own. This steak did not disappoint and the sauce was amazing.  Afterwards I had the cheesecake which was not only good but also the perfect size. If you are in New Braunfels you need to make a visit here and check this place out!"

My issue was the food quality. I have run restaurants and I know what should and should not be on a plate, especially with such a busy place. The salad was wilted. My tomatoes were starting to shrivel. The bread had been frozen and not thawed all the way before they cooked it. The meat was a lower grade than we were expecting.   Sometimes it's hard for me to eat out having shopped for three cafes and been a chef for 10 years, so take this review knowing I'm very picky.  My expectations are probably higher than they should be."

The people who work there are friendly.   The parking is difficult but the food is worth the trouble. Huisache's meals are one of a kind.  They take fairly ordinary recipes and add little twists.  Those twists make their entrees taste marvelous. Well done Huisache Grill!"

The mashed potatoes were dried out. The meat was over cooked. And the waitress was inattentive.    This place used to be a gem prior to the pandemic.  I would recommend it to people from out of town.  Now, I will just warn them to not waste their money here."

                "description": "Came here for the first time about 1 week ago. I loved the location, the atmosphere was romantic and cozy. My husband and I thought the place was beautiful, however the food was ok. We started off with some wine, the moscato was great and added to the ambiance. We had the broiled spinach and artichoke dip.  I was expecting a traditional dip, but let me tell you what we got was not average at all. The dip seemed to have a hint of lime in it. My husband loved it, it was not for me. I can more closely describe it to tasting like corn in a cup. They also serve it with bread and chips. For an entre, I had the parmesan breaded chicken breast. It was stuffed with mushroom's, spinach, cheese and  artichoke hearts, served with a side of penne pasta and broccoli. I wish that my chicken was stuffed significantly more. I could hardly taste the filling. The penne pasta was a little bland, but I did not mind it. The broccoli was cooked to perfection and I quite enjoyed it. My hubby got the 2oz mixed grill. He was satisfied, but mentioned it was not for him.   In conclusion, this place is worth a try, the location is beautiful, and they also have cats in their courtyard!"

I invariably look down at my house salad or side veggies and think, another disappointment. For the first time last night, we tried Huisache Grill. With my first bite of the house salad, I did a double take! Fresh! Beautifully prepared and presented. Delicious salad dressing. What?!  I come from a state where veggies are often served within a day of harvest. This salad tasted like that!  Many Texans might think big deal, gimmie meat! Well, I eat meat too and the meat I ordered was also skillfully prepared and darned near perfect. Factor in a personable, efficient server and despite how busy the restaurant was, my husband and I had a delightful dinner! We will be back and soon!"

Yes, I know that restaurants are short staffed, but at least explain that to your customers before they have to wait 20 minutes to be asked for a drink order at the bar or wait while others that came after you got served first.  I have been to a half-dozen restaurants within a 1 mile radius of Huisache in the last two weeks.  They have NO problems with fast, fair, and friendly service.  I may give them another chance, but it will be awhile.  They need to work on it."

Score on that count.Total Success!  In this Total, the restrooms are at the back of the store instead of as you enter. It's not something one intentionally seeks out at a liquor store, but I've had the need on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, in this case, it's a matter of out-of-sight is out-of-mind, as I found the men's room a bit dirty and ragged around noon on a Friday--far too early in the day to be due to foot traffic alone. That's in stark contrast to the Total near me with its sparkling, nearly spotless restrooms. If that aspect doesn't seem important to you, remember they hold tastings here. Their brand ambassadors can only be as clean as the facilities in which they clean up.  Then again, alcohol kills most germs, so party on! Four stars, and TOTALLY recommended!"

Honestly it felt like half the beer that TW Cedar Park and South Austin have.  Wines fared much better, but still lacking some of the offerings we typically find elsewhere.  Prices were great, as with all Total Wine stores.  Really wish they'd make all their locations the same size so we could depend on them.  Oh well, still better than most liquor stores right ?"

                "description": "The variety at Total Wine is fantastic! They always have samples you can try before you buy. John was great during our last visit. He introduced us to a new whiskey, that we loved and bought! He helped us find what we were looking for and was always friendly and fun to talk to. Stephanie Frankie was great too! Admittedly there are definitely people who work here that do NOT make you feel welcome and aren't friendly, the great people make up for the rude ones. You will know who is helpful and who to avoid. K.P. is great too! You can always count on her for help in finding a great wine. Happy New Year!"

                "description": "Let's face it, no one has every selection of wine or beer.  Especially with legislation and rules on how and what brands or alcohol can be imported.  A side desk aimed, I don't buy high end wine and I do. It really see any wine cellar controls in place so I sort of in my mind question how they ship store and control the quality of high dollar bottles so they don't skunk- or have any other issues.   For my purposes and my visit, this store was an unexpected visit but I had been wanting to try it out for awhile.  I was met with friendly staff, and an overwhelming selection of wines and beer.  At about every corner I was met with staff inquiring what I was looking for.  Wine tasting, a huge room for what I assume to be classes and finally a cold and shelf temp beer selection were all cleanly arranged and accompanied with more than adequate signage.    If we speak of selection, I would really like to have seen a better selection of German wine from the Pfalz region.  There is an abundant amount of wine that is from a wine drinking standpoint \"must try\".  But, I do not see them in any stores around."

                "description": "Ideal for samples!   Friendly staff, decent pricing.   A lot of times I have been there samples were being offered, which is kind of cool. Not just wines or beers, but whiskey and tequila and such. Once I was offered absinthe and the man giving out the samples was the business owner all the way from Oregon! It was like a reverse Oregon-trail, I told him after the sample.  Selection is not what I expect from Total Wine, I have shopped at their locations across the U.S. and this is the least I have experienced. Some of it might be due to Texas Law, as I asked why other stores (such as in Houston) can't ship to this location, and I was told it was Texas law.   A perfect place to pick up mainstream beers and wines, as well as to try the samples (I think they have a schedule for the tastings)."

We were visiting from out of town and wanted to purchase some wine. They were sold out of our favorite brand (obviously-Cooper and Thief) so we were recommended some other wine that was supposed to be similar and purchased 3 bottles.   When we got it home they were all horrible. We tried this brand and it's 3 varietals and didn't care for any. THANK GOODNESS they offered a refund even though the bottle was opened.

I found beer that was best by 2017, 2018 and January of 2019, it's December 2019 guys!!! When bringing the out of date beer to managements attention, my husband and I were pretty much scoffed at and they tried to educate us on the fact that beer can age. Well yes, that may be true, but not for most beer and brewers put best by dates for a reason. Will not be back!"

Total wine not only had more Shinner varieties they also had a bigger and better beer selection. I think they had a better selection of everything period. The staff interaction was pleasant but they didn't have a lot of people on the floor to help you while you were shopping. The other issue I had was actually getting out of the store. They have the doors blocked off to force you to go through a checkout line. This is an issue if you don't need to check out but have to squeeze through people just to leave. Other than that go here over Spec's."

I recommend you do one full loop before trying the hop-on/hop-off option, so you can see which locations you want to see.  Our tour guide, BC, was hilarious and really made the tour fun. There was a lot to see in San Antonio and the bus route made sure to stop at all the popular tourist areas!  Note: Wear comfortable shoes and bring dollar bills to tip your tour guides."

Our first trip we rode the entire route to see what was available. They driver, Jack, did an amazing job of giving us some history and pointing out extra elements. He had a small bit of the tour recorded, but it was mostly live.  After we decided what we wanted to go back to we rode 3 other times. The other drivers were nice, but none compared to Jack.   Even though they say the buses are air conditioned, it doesn't hold up to Texas summer heat. Sitting on the lower level gave a little relief, but not much. The upper level is a neat experience, but I would definitely recommend spring or fall to give it a try."

                "description": "One of our favorite things to do when we visit a new town is to take a tour bus that will acquaint us with some fun locations and introduce us to the city. So we scheduled the hop-on-hop off bus tour for early in our stay.  We found the stops to be a little underwhelming. Some of them take you to touristy places that you'd expect (The Alamo, Pearl, La Villita, etc.) and other stops felt a little forced. Random streets or restaurants that appear to have no real attraction other than perhaps a deal that a business made with the bus company to put a stop there.  The experience also varies depending on which driver you get. Over the course of our three days, we rode on several busses and found that Kat was by far the most entertaining and engaging. She sang along with the songs, cracked jokes and interacted with the guests. Other drivers hit a pre-recorded track and just drove. I do appreciate that each driver was able to modify the script a bit to match their personality, but some really could have done more to liven it up.  Overall, I'd give this tour three stars due to the inconsistency of the drivers and the strange stops. But Kat was so fun that she earned the company an extra star. She really went out of her way to make our trip fun and memorable."

We took a wheelchair as she can't walk far distances. It took you to all of the good places to see. The top of the bus had much better views and you could tell what the narrative was talking about. No air up top but they had a cover and it wasn't bad for July. Of course my Mom couldn't climb the stairs so her and my sister stayed down below in the mild air conditioning."

We were on the north side of town and the bus was 20 minutes late, or so we thought. Next thing we knew the driver turned off the mapped route and didn't reappear for another 20 minutes (I assume a coffee stop). Bus number 903. As we had walked to the corner to see if he was coming we weren't at the sign, although we waved to flag him down as soon as he turned the corner and saw no one at the stop he hit the gas. We had to walk almost a mile into town to see if we could get a refund-not looking good. Much better to give you money to the numerous vagabond milling about than this company."

We only wanted to see one thing off of the bus so we rode to it and got off.   When we first got on at stop 1, Jesel was on the bus, I guess as a hostess or something.  She was super nice.   The driver for our first leg was BC.   He mixed up recordings and live speaking and was very clear on the stops.   His narration was informative and entertaining.    Our second leg was 180 degrees.  We could not hear the driver very well at all from the back of the bus.  I was following along on the map and planned to get off the bus at #18.   He stopped at #17 and was talking but we could not hear him.  he then drove right by #18.   He tried to say that #17 was #18 but I'm not buying it.  We got on at #13 and there's no way he made 5 stops before the final stop at #19(aka #1) plus I was looking at the map and knew where we were.  I think he was just taking short cuts.  Your experience will vary wildly depending on where you sit and who your driver is."

Ended up buying them from the boat company directly as we had already been in line for 45 minutes when we found this out so the online combo is no bargain.  At the bus boarding spot the online voucher wasn't good. We have to go across the street to get tickets printed. Tried to get on the bus and we were given the wrong tickets.

                "description": "During my visit to SA, we took the sightseeing bus around the city to check out the different sites. We bought our tickets and boarded near the Alamo. After waiting about 15 minutes, we boarded the bus and went on our tour. There were both pro and cons.  The cons:   Since the bus was crowded, I had no choice but to sit in the back of the bus while the driver drove us around talking about the different sites. I wasn't happy at first since it was difficult seeing out the frosty windows which was from the see through advertisement that covered the window. In addition to not being able to see, I was next to the motor which was very loud and made it very difficult for me to hear what the driver was saying. There wasn't much air circulation and got a little stuffy.   The pros:   We bought the all day pass so we were able to get on and off the bus at their designated pick up/drop off locations. This gave us the flexibility to get on and off at our leisure without having to drive around the city to look for and pay for parking. It was nice being able to see the different spots around town and it gave us ideas on where to eat and what we wanted to see more of. When we had gotten back on, we were able to find a spot on the second floor of the bus since less people are riding the further it gets away from the starting location.   Overall, it was a nice experience but thought it was a little pricey for just seeing a handful of sites throughout the city. If you're not a big walker and want to see the city, then I think this experience is an ideal one."

You can really get hurt by the low lying branches that seem to jump out of nowhere and smack you in the face. Driver did mention it after previously passing about three trees. However, there is no signage so be careful. The \"stops\" were ok and lead to some pretty trendy places. Overpriced for a 24 hour pass on a bus that runs only until 5:30. â€  Great views of the river can be seen from atop the bus."

While not their fault, road construction made it impossible to stay on route although there really weren't any great points of interests. We were most interested in going to the Tower of America's as the last stop. However, the bus dropped us so far away it would have been better for us to walk to the tower from our hotel."

We had a lot of fun on this tour during our short stay in San Antonio. Our tour guide was Kat and she was very good at what she does and made our trip special. I highly recommend this tour if you want to get the most out of your trip to San Antonio and see more than just the Alamo and Riverwalk."

                "description": "I'm usually fine with 'tourist trap' exhibits, restaurants, and tours, but this one was decidedly 'meh'.  This is only a slightly upgraded city bus route with not a lot for your money unless you really enjoy upper-deck views of downtown San Antonio.  Nothing wrong with that, but the choicest views can be glimpsed either from the Tower of the Americas or down on the River Walk.   The 'tour' part is just a recorded tape that plays as the bus reaches each stop.  Given that there's more music than speech, the speech isn't that informative, and it's hard to hear over the grind of the diesel engine, I'd give it a miss.  Since I experienced a 40-minute wait at a stop between buses, I recommend that you just walk, cab, water-taxi, or uber it between your destinations.    Tip: If you insist on having this sub-par experience, at least don't do it for full price.  This outfit typically has a sale on Groupon, or discount tickets on their website. Failing that, grab any of the free maps/guides in the Rivercenter or tourist info booths around the city.  There's usually a coupon lurking in there somewhere."

I would recommend going during the week and early, and after school starts back up.  We liked riding on the top deck, better view.  Buy a ticket,  stay on for the whole ride, than get on and off as many times as you want, a one day pass is good for 24 hours, you can do 2 and 3 day passes too."

You pay separately for each item which is costly. If I have one thing to say that would like to see changed is either the size of the bread or the patty. The patty is not thick enough to accommodate the size of the bread. Too much bun for me!"

                "description": "The company logo was like a throwback to Happy Days reruns, so I was very happy to walk in to an ambience of jukebox style 50's music. Yay! I was born in the late 70's, but who doesn't enjoy being transported to an era where we can imagine life was a little slower, a little more private and moments were meant to be embraced in the present and not social media.  Ordered the double cheeseburger - I asked for it well done and it was still juicy. After I ordered, I realized it was probably a bit too big for my appetite but I sure did eat it all - it was too juicy not to. :-) I really liked the buns they used for burger too. I'll admit, I'm not sure if it was poppy seeds on top or something else, but whatever it was, the buns were fresh, soft and tasty. Complemented the burger well. I'll find out next time what the bun is.  Who doesn't love freshly cut fires with the skin on? Salted and fried to perfection. Crunchy and soft at the same time. The regular size was a prefect portion.  Oh, this place also has a great peppermint malt shake. Yum! I can do peppermint all year long, so glad they had it well into the new year. They should have it all year - why not?   Location also has several TVs in great spots so you don't miss your favorite team while enjoying a good-old-fashioned burger, fries and malt."

                "description": "I came here during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the dining room was closed. They seem a bit under-equipped to do take-out orders. I ordered a cheeseburger and hamburger patties a la carte, medium rare. After picking up my order and driving for a few minutes, I noticed the paper bag was leaking and the grease was getting all over my car. I later realized this was because they packed the hamburger patties *swimming* in pan sauce, with nothing in the foam container to keep it from dripping everywhere. I understand that medium rare meats release juices after cooking, but they should have used an air-tight container or put something in the container to absorb the juices.  To make matters worse, I called them to let them know about this issue with their to-go orders. The lady who answered was rude and disinterested in speaking with me. No apology was issued for how the order was packaged and no thank you for notifying them.  I just cannot see myself coming here again during the pandemic. The food was decent but not worth the customer service or the messy packaging."

It did hit the spot! Fries looked homemade and crispy, needed a bit of salt or spice but overall pretty good. Little sister got the kids chicken basket, it came with the same crispy homemade fries and a free kids ice cream. The chicken nuggets were little dinosaurs kinda cute but also looked store bought.

We often order double cheeseburger and split it, this way we get a \"whole\" burger patty w/o the additional bread. Definitely my hubby's favorite onion rings are from Chesters. Their fries are fresh cut, sometimes they can be a little soggy but its just one of the things that you get used to. Sometimes the burgers are a little greasy, but when they are perfect- they make my heart happy.   The do also have good hot dog- who would have known(?).   They have an incredible selection of bottled/canned beer, some wine (upset that they stopped selling sangria in a bottle).   You order at the counter, they call out your name and you pick up your delish food. On a beautiful day/night, they will roll up the windows. They usually have whatever game is playing that day.   They also have shakes and malts made to order.   You either love it or not, but they must be doing something right since they several locations and have been around a long time now."

The portions of the burger is filling, delicious, and full of flavor. I would say however, because the burger is larger in size, the price is a tad bit higher. I ordered a cheeseburger, salad, and tea and it was about $15. But it was worth it!  Also, for you newcomers, this is the type of restaurant that you place your order first and seat yourself.

If you want to leave customers hanging for 15 minutes, that is a serious flaw in your customer service. If it takes you 30 minutes to prepare burgers at 11am, when you just opened, you need to inform your customers it's a 30 minutes wait, not 15 minutes!!!  Your continued excuse for the delay is freshness is unacceptable. Man up and accept responsibility. And by the way, there are numerous other establishments that serve hot, fresh food products, and do not misrepresent the time for preparedness.

How can you not have some sort of Jr Burger on your menu?  Regardless, I ordered a simple cheeseburger with no onion and it tasted great. They ask how you like your beef cooked, and I think my favorite thing is the bun. It's perfectly buttered and toasted and the poppy seeds and a nice touch.  I'll keep rolling in here as potential meet up spots with buddies. You're able to have conversation in here and eat a good burger, what more can you ask for?

The added crunch from the pecans and dried cranberries *chefs kiss*  Some special dressing comes with it too! I'm in love.   I always get a slice of cheese pizza! Can't go wrong there! Amazing  I've tried their many of appetizer and I ain't mad.   Meatballs are amazing!!   Made myself hungry for this salad talking about it!"

This most recent time, we got the Margherita pizza. It wasn't my favorite pizza I've had here, but it was decent. It was done a little differently than this type of pizza I've had in the past. Instead of slices of mozzarella, it covered the entire pizza.  I do love their ranch dressing. I'm not sure if it's made in house, but it does taste like it is. Their salads are tasty every time. We always get one. And the beer selection!!! They have an amazing beer selection. Something for everyone."

Then something went \"sideways\"!  Last summer we received a \"blonde bottomed, cold pizza courtesy of \"Hunger, no such thing as a Rush\".   Looking to see if things had been fixed and a non marinara based pizza, we decided to give them another try.   70 minutes later, we received a Luke warm pizza and the insult of a receipt with an \"extra\" tip blank and puppy dog eyes of the driver!  I am now officially done with PI and Hunger whatever!"

My friends have mixed feelings about the crust and onions (sometimes they smell weird) but I happen to LOVE the crust and my pizza doesn't come with onions lol.   The set-up of the establishment is a little odd and the staff sometimes are just not friendly- hence the 4 stars instead of 5."

Thanks pizza italia. If you havent been. Go give them a visit and support them."

When speaking to the manager on the condition of said pizza, their reply is \"well you accepted it, so there is nothing I can do\". I have ordered pizza from Pizza Italia for more than 5 years and never been treated like this nor had this bad of pizza. Proves that the bigger you get the quality goes to s**t. We will be happy to take our business elsewhere. At over $25 plus tip per pizza you would think that quality control would be part of the service. Guess I was mistaken."

We had people visiting and we raved about the awesome pizza shop down the street (Pizza Italia). We order 30 wings, a large pizza and a drink. We go get it, get home and give the kids their pizza and then we sit down to enjoy their awesome wings... Look at the picture and see what we saw.  I called them and they proceeded to act like assholes saying the wings were right. We gathered up all the food, pizza and drink included and went down to the pizza shop. They then argue the wings are perfectly fine. I press them for a bit then they admit the wings were different then they have always been due to an issue with the supply order.  I tell them I understand that but it'd be nice to know up front maybe? They say yeah maybe, but you already ate some of the pizza and drank some of the soda so we're only refunding you the wings... even though they're good, \"I mean, did you even try them\", they said. I ordered extra wet buffalo hot and lemon pepper and they were all exactly the same. No sauce, no seasoning. Look at the picture.  So they ruin your dinner, give you a good ol' bait and switch, argue with you about it even though they know the wings aren't the same as always, then they decide what to refund or not. Very interesting approach to business.  Look at the picture and judge for yourself. Not even wingstop serves wings like that."

Our waitress was nice but pretty aloof. She got our drink order (and chips and salsa) then vanished. We watched our frozen drinks melt at the bar. Finally I just got up myself and asked the bartender if they were ours (they were) and served them to us myself. The fajitas I ordered were sizzling, but way over cooked.

Side salad was missing, the burger was RAW! We called and spoke to a manager and they were very apologetic and said they would credit us for the burger and side salad. Fast forward to today 10/09/20 called in the order and explained what happened 09/11/20, the employee over the phone stated Chili's will not honor this! We don't give away free food. Free food? We are not asking for free food! I wasnt even able to eat the meal purchased on 9/11/20. The employee said there is nothing he will do about it. When asked to speak to a manager, he stated he was the manager. How unprofessional and rude! This location has lost our business, I DO NOT and WILL NOt recommend eating at this location!"

                "description": "Food was good.  Service was bad. I left my phone at home and the other two in my party were Senior Citizens so we asked for hard copies of the menu.  Our second waitress brought us one menu and said the manager said we could only have one per table.  The menu was in Spanish and when we told the waitress, she said it just looked that way!!! We told her to get us a different one anyway. So we got a third waiter instead. He greeted us and was ready to take our order.  We said we need menus.  He brought us ONE and said the manager said only one per table. After we had to ask for utensils, the rest of the meal went fine. The manager came out and listened to our complaints and said the one menu per table was from higher up.  I've had other issues with the service at this location and I don't think I will return. Even if I liked the food, this disregard for those without technology abilities left a bad taste in my mouth."

We ask what the wait is for a party of two and are told there is no wait.  We turn under the Loop and pull into their parking lot.  We enter the restaurant where we then find out it's a thirty minute wait.  What the !?  I don't believe in the less than two minutes it takes us to reach them they filled up that fast.  I guess they just say whatever to get you in thinking you'll stay and wait.  Hey, I like Chili's but we are not returning.  For options try the newly reopened Mama's - where we went tonight - which is nearby or the even closer La Fonda.  Nuts!  I'm not going to play their games."

This Chili's is one of their more consistent places and I can appreciate that. The service was good, we were seated quickly and our server was very attentive.   My vegetarian self loves to order the guacamole burger with a black bean patty. I really adore this burger. The only thing that messes it up is when they over cook the patty. It's kind of like a coin toss of if it's cooked right or not but most times I'd bet that it's cooked right. For my one side I will order a side a broccoli when I'm feeling health conscious but I do get fries from time to time and they are great as well.   With this meal I ordered dessert and OHHHHH MY GOSH I was super happy I did!! I got the salted caramel molten cake and this is some last meal type ish! Like if I had to plan a last meal the salted caramel molten cake would be the dessert.  It was amazing and worth every calorie and the extra running time I put in for it."

Props also to the samples everywhere of beer and tequila makes looking for booze that much easier.  This place has an epic deli as well and they sell fresh pickles which is always legit. The beer section was small in comparison to other specs but they make up for it with the deli.   Things I would do: promote the October beers in a certain section.

Well if you have (or if you ever are), this is the place for you.  I was told to bring a \"moscato,\" but when I arrived at Spec's, I realized there were half a dozen types of it.  d'Asti, pink, black, dessert, bubbly, etc.  I was like WTH do I do? Fortunately, Spec's has plenty of wine experts on staff and they bailed me out.  Then, my next question was \"should it be served chilled or at room temp?\"  They said \"it depends.\"  I decided on chilled, and they directed me to this barrel full of water that magically chills the bottle in seven minutes.  It's pure witchcraft folks, but it's free, so check it out.  I'm still in total awe of this magical barrel full of water.  P.S. don't forget that this Spec's location has a deli in the back that's good for lunch.  See my previous review for a few details.  The food is really good.  Why four stars instead of five?  Because they charge a penalty for using credit cards.  They try to convince you that it's a \"discount\" if you pay with cash, debit, or check, but I see it more as a penalty."

                "description": "A unique Texas liquor store. Good for somethings and nah on others. Nice craft beer assortment, wine has lots to choose from, Whiskey/bourbon unique items, cordials good selection, rum is ok and lots to choose from in vodka category.  Tequila assortment is hodgepodge and not to great.  They have a great deli to visit in the back.  The thorn that bugs me is they ask if you want a bag for your purchase. Really? It a tad tacky if you ask me. My previous visit started this little irritation as I purchased a very expensive whiskey for my husband and was asked this question. On this visit as I was checking out I mentioned this past experience. Right after told the cashier what happened and paid for my purchase...what did he ask me? (Yup!) Did I want a bag? I straight up asked him why they ask. His answer was \"we don't really want to give them out if we don't have to.\"  Really? Ok if it's a recycle thing then take the route of encouraging people to bring their own bag like Sprouts. If it's a being cheap thing then find another way to save a buck - your bag with the Spec's name and logo  is important advertising that walks out the door with every customer that spends their money in the store. It's a missed advertising opportunity if I don't walk out with a bag.  My suggestion is to stop having your cashiers ask people this question."

I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm 10+ years over the legal drinking age and I just got around to trying a margarita. As such, I'm a total novice and didn't know what to get. I hastily Google searched \"best tequila for margaritas\" and was hit with a million results. Thankfully, I found a super helpful employee to assist rather than Google. I wish I would have gotten his name but he was a middle aged gentlemen with short graying hair and he was so kind and thoughtful as I bumbled my way through the store. He didn't make me feel stupid for my lack of knowledge when it comes to alcohol and was just really non-judgmental and had such a calm vibe. I can't even begin tell you how much I appreciated his suggestions. And he was spot on because the margaritas I've been making at home are delicious! I will definitely go here again when I need more."

In this Specs there is a small deli in the back offering various sandwiches.  Not only do they have a generous selection of sandwiches they also have those back there which will help you choose perfect pairing to go with their adult libations.  These suggestions range from various cheeses to meats.  If you are the cigar smoker, there is a large selection of cigars inside to choose from.  There are various Specs in the San Antonio but thus far this one seems to be one of the larger ones offering a greater selection.  Any bar supplies you are looking for can be found here.  If you are like me, you will walk around the store to see the myriad of drinks they have.  I actually found some various flavors of soju and managed to find a bottle of Brazilian rum (cachaÃ§a).  The prices are good and they offer a military discount.  There is also a rewards program.  I know what you are thinking.  If you in there that much that you need a reward card, then you (fill in your judging thoughts). A good place to get lost and find your favorite drink at very reasonable prices."

Up to this point I have always been pretty loyal to Gabriel's, and no disrespect but this place is way cooler!  The deli foods look really good, I was wondering why we didn't come here for lunch instead!  The alcohol prices look great, I always try to compare prices at each liquor store that I visit.  Just like the Gabriel's on 1604, Spec's has two separate prices, one being lower than the other, and all you need is your Spec's card for the additional discount, which is absolutely free to sign up for.  The lady who signed me up also told me that they have special promotions for card holders as well.  I loved the truffles; love the variety of gift-sets; love that they have a HUGE selection of beer, wine, spirits, and ales; love that they've got coffee beans for sale a-la-carte style; love the friendliness of all of the staff members.  LOVE this place!  Highly recommended to anyone, even if you are not a drinker, you are guaranteed to find something you like."

The jalapeÃ±o cheese bread is a must. You must pay up front before you can get the food at the deli, but that gives you time to browse the candy selection up front.   Downsides can be they change up the menu, not all items are available consistently. As of June 2017, Peppered BLT is gone. :/  Oh well, maybe I'll find something new."

                "description": "The Northside has been the happening spot as of late. With the addition of The Big Hops Growler on Huebner Road, the influence of the craft brews, wines and spirits on our lives is growing more intense and popular with each day. And while the HEB on DeZavala Road has a pretty decent array of beers and wines to quench the most discerning palate, SPEC'S is the way to go.       This SPEC'S location always reminds me of the one I went to in Austin. It has a pretty diverse selection of beers, wines and spirits alongside elegantly displayed chocolates and cheeses. Unlike the one at Rector, this one is more vast. The lanes open with shelves and shelves of products. There are fancy tequilas, Hennessey, whiskeys, rums etc. with prices to match. They have the customary two buck chuck. Or you can splurge on a high end vodka meant for that special office party to impress your boss and coworkers.   Throughout the store each section is manned by workers who specialize in that particular department.  I'm a beer person myself, so I tend to gravitate toward that location of the store. They have a quite impressive selection of craft beers veering towards Texas, foreign, regional, national and hard to find stuff. On hand they have Trappist Ales, Barleywine, Stouts, IPA's by breweries like Rogue, Southern -Tier, Karbach, Ranger Creek, Mikkeller, Stone, Prairie etc. It is quite a stellar selection of kind brews.    The service is good here and the employees are knowledgeable. And of course you get a deal when you pay with cash or debit. Which is pretty cool right about now. While I do like this place, the sheer volume of items is worth the drive, I do like the one on Rector. It has a more personable touch than this one. Sometimes I have noticed at this location it can suffer from that whole frat boy vibe ala UTSA (I'm not hating, I myself graduated from there!) and they can clog up the aisles. Still when I look and see the selection the other patrons are deliberating on, I have come to the realization that we are all here on the same mission: to find good drink at good prices.   I like SPEC'S, particularly this location. Good products, good service and good prices for all. Total Wine and More. Gabriel's Superstore. Pig Liquors. Many locations of SPEC'S and more to come. Our city is no longer the Heavy Metal Capital of Texas, but now more readily and quickly being recognized as the drinking capital as well...\\m/"

                "description": "I went to Spec's with my wife yesterday. We went to look for some of texas finest wine. Luckily we found it. On our way to the check out an employee tries flirting with my wife and gets in front of her and she's trying to walk around him and he tries to talk to her. I'm behind her watching this unfold. I look at him and I ask him \"what are you doing?\" My wife is already uncomfortable. He responds with \"I'm just messing with her\" his professionalism was no where to be found. And his action was completely unappreciated"

                "description": "Great prices! Great selection! Knowledgeable staff! Save 5% off all purchases when you pay with cash, debit, or check. Get a Spec's savings card (just a rewards card, not a credit thing) and save on items that are on sale!  Tastings of select wine and liquor usually every Friday's and Saturday's.    Downside I've noticed about this location...not real great about maintaining their shelves appearance. Maybe they are understaffed? I don't know but last night I saw 2 guys working in liquor area but the shelves were a mess!! Nobody fronting or filling empty spots on the shelves. Nobody available to help customers in beer section and Lots of people wandering that area. However, right before leaving beer section with our selection, we noticed someone inside the beer cooler. He was working hard to stock the empty spots in the cooler windows!! So, GOOD FOR YOU, DUDE, FOR TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS!!  Just wish someone else was outside the cooler helping customers, but at least YOU were doing what you were supposed to do!!  Spec's management, you need to work on having your shelves maintained and fully staffed to help customers!"

                "description": "SPECS, I LOVE YOU.  I have to admit, I have never stepped a foot inside of Spec's. I've heard fantastic things from friends and co-workers about the one over in The Forum so when I saw one was being built by my house, I was pretty excited to be one of those people who bragged about how awesome Specs is! ;)  My first trip here was actually before it even opened. The sign was up, there were minimal cars out front so I wasn't actually sure if it was open or closed. When I walked up to the door, the guy said they were having a soft opening and they actually didn't have any alcohol yet, just food. I passed on going in because I originally wanted a bottle of wine and didn't want to buy anything unnecessary, didn't realize at that time that they have SO MUCH MORE then just alcohol.  When I went back, I probably spent about an hour just browsing the different aisles and all the fine foods they had in the back. It was pretty shocking to me! I'm from England and it's pretty hard to find British food, especially at British restaurants (which there's only one or two in San Antonio anyways) and most of the time, the price is marked up ridiculously. Specs had an awesome selection of foreign foods, including chocolates and frozen meals. It was just fantastic.   Employees are so helpful. I was just here yesterday trying to pick out a Riesling and the man helping me was asking a bunch of different questions about what I'm looking for, he picked out a really yummy one, gave me two different options, a $20 or $10 so wasn't just trying to get me to pay an arm and a leg for a bottle of wine, which made me happy.  Also, if you have kiddos - they have a shopping cart with a miniature car attached in the front, total bonus and another reason why I love Specs. Keeps my 2 year old happy while I browse for wine!! ;) One of my favorite places in SA and would advise anyone to check it out."

                "description": "I'm perhaps the only non-drinker who loves to shop at Spec's.  Go friggin' figure.  Alright, so I'm not a total non-drinker; however, I did notice that the past couple of times I've been here I bought Sprecher's cherry coke and bar nuts.  Seriously????    Even the cashier asked me right before she started checking me out, \"Do you know about our rewards card?\"   Me: \"No.  I didn't know you had one.\"   Nice cashier lady: \"Yeah.  It's actually pretty good.\"   Pause.  **Looks over my purchases** Pause.  **Still scans**  Pause.  **One final look-through**  Nice cashier lady: \"So uhm.... yeah, you don't have any items here that are eligible for discounts SOOooooooo...  yeah, we have one.\"    **Quickly checks me out of her line**"

                "description": "It is time to start to enjoy your visits to the wine, spirits, and finer foods store.  Spec's has now arrived inside of the 1604 loop and not a day too soon.    If you are persnickety about, well, your wine, spirits, and finer foods, then you're in luck.  Not only does Spec's offer an expansive variety in each of these categories, the staff is incredibly helpful.  And knowledgeable.    Fitting that they opened on the 4th of July.  We are freed from the other San Antonio standards and now have some variety.  During today's impromptu and unanticipated visit, I was asked very politely by no less than two staff whether I needed any help.  I was pleasantly surprised that the service was consistent with the excellent help I have received at other Spec's and they had only been open for four hours!  Now that is something to toast to!  Salud!"
