The gentleman at Sister Creek who served our wine did great. Brandy was very knowledgeable, personable, professional and kind. She is a walking wealth of wine/vineyard information. If you're looking to book a tour, short or long, I highly recommend this company! We were given the option for her to provide a little info and just let us vibe or provide us with everything. I love all things wine so I went for it all! I wasn't disappointed. (Btw she took magnificent pictures for us as well)."

Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

We visited two wine vineyards and were able to spend the last hour of the tour walking around Fredericksburg. Overall, the tour was amazing! It was put together well and worth the price! I highly recommend doing this tour if you're in town visiting or live in San Antonio. They also give military discounts"

Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

We did a private tour with just 3 and it was completely affordable, which was my biggest concern off the bat. Communication was impeccable from the get-go and our tour guide Matt was such a blast. We hit up 3 wineries and a distillery that made moonshine. Each one was small and unique where we were really able to  converse with the staff and talk about the wines. Due to us having a small group we never felt rushed and when we asked for an extra few minutes, Matt easily obliged. I will definitely be going back for another tour!!"

We did the tour that consisted of two wineries and lunch in Fredricksburg. It was great!  Brandy and Matt think of everything! We were picked up in a clean van right at our hotel, so don't worry if you don't have a car! Matt even bring out a step stool so you don't have strain to get into the car. I didn't need it necessarily, but I did enjoy that extra touch. They gave us goodie bags while we drove to the country side. Matt is very knowledgeable and is a great guide of the area. He is full of little facts about the area!   The wineries we went to were very cool! Sister Creek was in an old cotton gin and more personal. Becker's was more upscale and large. we ended up getting 6 bottles of wine altogether. I was so surprised by the amount of good wine grown in Texas! Who knew?!!  Pros:  Brandy and Matt think of everything!  Don't worry about paying anything at the wineries- they take care of that! Transportation Good wine Great tour of the area Brandy and Matt are friendly and great at conversation They really know their stuff and love to explain anything about wine!  Cons:  I had a hankering for some cheese! But that's all I can think of!"

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Jodie is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  She is very knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing. By the time we were done I felt like I had made an incredible new friend. I can't wait to go back and do more tours."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

I did not have a lot of information on the distilleries and Daniel was incredibly helpful when figuring out where we should go. We had 19 people on the bus and we had SO much fun. The bus was super clean, Daniel was great and we had the best time. We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

There were 7 of us on a family vacation trip and we wanted to have a fun but classy wine tour where we got our money's worth and then some. As a new resident to the area, it's important for me to know what high quality tour guides are available. Well, Winding Road Hill Country Wine Tours with Billy is definitely the way to go, folks."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

We enjoyed his friendly banter, nice and clean van, and all of the places we went. Will definitely book with David again."

                "description": "Do NOT recommend! We booked a tour for 8 people and everything was a mess from the beginning. We were told we would be upgraded to a 15 passenger bus. A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there.

He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home.

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

                "description": "Apologies for this review being so incredibly late but Austin Nites was the best! We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

                "description": "For $700+ for four hours we would have expected a better looking bus. Multiple dents around outside of bus. The AC barely working. Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

They also provided ice, cups and a cooler for us so we didn't have to worry about taking our own. I would definitely recommend them, and will do business with them again. Thank you Robert for the awesome service and thank you Walker (our driver) for keeping up with my crazy friends and brining us home safe."

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

If you've been to Gruene you know parking can be a little bit of a nightmare, that is why we love to come to this place since they have their own parking and is also located near the entrance to the town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, with a cute little garden which is great for photos during spring. They have a decent selection of wines, which you can purchase by the glass or a bottle. If you are hungry, they also have a BBQ food truck but is not always open. Last but no least, if you are parent searching for a changing table, this is not the place for you. We had to change our baby inside our car, which was a little annoying since it was 90+ degrees outside."

They're right on the Guadalupe River in downtown historic Gruene TX. If you're having a bridal party, etc. this is an ideal spot with great social distancing and a recently added BBQ Food Truck. I'm not giving it more stars because 1) they're not growing grapes and 2) I'm really not impressed with their products BUT I don't like sweet wines which they specialize in from the looks of their menu. Their service was impeccable and quick and attentive even though it was a busy Saturday. Dog and kid friendly. Cheese and crackers available."

I gave her a $5 tip on a $5 glass of wine. She poured it in a plastic cup and I asked for a glass. She told me a wine glass would be $2 additional. OK! I just gave you a $100% tip, not happening.  Only reason this place is getting an additional star is bc the hostess was sweet. Don't waste your time on this place, it's crap. Also, be prepared to wear a mask and not get good service."

                "description": "Recall when I said I had reviews in my drafts? Ughs, this one is from 2018 (don't judge me).   Winery on the Gruene is a small 'boutique' style winery that makes vino on the premise. There are a variety of vino's to sample at a reasonable price (4 tastings for only $4.00). If you know what you want and are a true vino drinker like me, you can 'go for it' and just order a glass (Vino Blanco in my case, $5.00 per glass; see my receipt).  The vino selection here is decent and the customer service is even better. The only facet about this location that is not great is the lack of room inside when you go for a tasting. However, if you have time to come here and have a glass of vino while you sit outside and enjoy a nice spring day, you will not be sorry.   Happy Drinking!"

Pictured is the wine-a-rita, mix your favorite wine with a frozen margarita mix. These wines are seriously delicious. I'm usually not into fruity wines, but these are done right and are amazing. The employees are super friendly and it's a good time every time we go. There's even a bbq food truck in the parking lot if you get hungry!  Dog friendly patio, with some more secluded picnic benches if you'd like. Highly recommend!"

                "description": "Wow, how have I not written a review about Winery on the Gruene?! It's like my best friend's favorite place to go in Gruene so I've actually been so many times... We've been visiting since they were at the original location down the street like ten years ago in one of the new strip centers on the outskirts of the little village of Gruene! Winery on the Gruene got lucky when this location became available, right in the center of Gruene!  Winery on the Gruene is located just up the hill from Guadalupe River about a block west of Gruene Hall. Great location, easy to find. Lots of room to sit inside or out. There is even space upstairs to sit or rent out for private parties.  All the staff have always been amazing... Thank you! That is always one of the reasons to go back to any business.   Winery on the Gruene is not a vineyard. Most grapes are not from Texas. Maybe not even any. That is my only complaint as I like to keep my wines local, although that is what works for these guys. They are not limited in their creations. They purchase grapes from all across the country to make their wines. They have a large selection on their menu, so you will find something you like. Winery on Gruene specializes in these sweet fruity wines, which is one of the reasons why my bestie LOVE them!  My favorite is Blackberrry Merlot. On my last visit for Tami C.'s birthday surprise, that is all I had... no need to sample, just give me a big full glass and I'll be a happy camper!   Yeah, you  know I'll be back for some of that Blackberry Merlot!"

Very charming staff and was helpful on wine tasting. We choose four wines to taste from their menu and have different emo fave on what we thought of the wine. I must say the tasting serving are healthy pour and provide the opportunity to enjoy a little more of each wine.  For me most of the wine was somewhat sweet and berry tasting as the Merlot wine has a hint of sweet berry. Reminded me of when I was had my first drink of Boonesfarm wine but not that sweet...lol.  Charming with that modern industrial farm decor.  I would come back to just sit on the porch with glass of vino. Cheers."

The server kept moving back and forth, checking on us, pouring wines at other tables, and had a smile on his face.   I had one of his award winning wines.  And, my friend tried a different award winner.  They did not disappoint.  This cute lil gem accommodates the vino aficionado as well as the novice."

They have all different kinds of wine so you will be able to find something you enjoy, especially since you get some free tasting. We go a least once a month for a date night. Some Saturday nights they have live music. They have a wine club you can join to get bottles at a discount and many more benefits. You should visit if you like wine."

There was 5 of us and the first 3 wines we tried were free and let me say, we were smart about it and ended up tasting 15 wines between us 5, each getting a different wine and passing it around each try. I highly recommend the diablo wine! It's a dry red but super super smooth! The whites were all amazing! But the sangria's? #givemeabarrel they both were excellent! I will definitely have to bring my grandma back to wine taste!"

                "description": "Totally chill relaxing place to enjoy some wine with friends.  Nestled back among the oak trees off 46, this place is a little gem.  Patio has a view of the vineyard, and when the weather cools off there is nothing better than sitting under the trees enjoying the fire pits. Community tables make for great conversation and an easy way to meet people when new to the area. Check Facebook for date nights and various events. To really get the feel for this spot, it's best to go when there is a band and food trucks.   Experienced friendly staff really make this place stand out. I don't know much about wine so staff was great about helping me select an excellent \"Wurst Red\" wine. This place probably deserves a 5 star for good time, but I lowered it to 4 since seating indoors is limited.   And chairs on the patio are not very comfortable. I will certainly update my review if changes are made. Would love to see some comfy coffee house style couches indoors to make it more comfortable.   Pro Tip:  Order the red or white frozen sangria. It is the BOMB!!  Tastes like a fruit slushy in the most delicious way."

They offered for us to try the two bottles we selected before we purchased them which was excellent customer service, above and beyond.   The staff was pleasant, had a sense of humor and were quick to accommodate guests to keep them dry and happy when a wild rain storm blew in.  We made reservations to return at the end of the summer when their wine list changes, they gave us lots of information!  Lots of outdoor space and a great ambiance.   Very enjoyable afternoon."

We didn't realize we needed a reservation until after we arrived, but the sweet lady at the entrance helped us make a reservation so we could get seated. The outdoor seating was very spread out, and there was a lot of shade from all the large trees. Our server helped us choose a bottle, and brought us any sample we wanted before purchasing a bottle. The wine was so good we left with a couple bottles to bring home. The pricing is very affordable ($20-$30 a bottle). I would highly recommend visiting this gem near New Braunfels."

My fiancee and I have come out here several times on a motorcycle ride to enjoy the peaceful surroundings and get away from the traffic in the city. We love their frozen sangria and the Comal Red. They offer a plastic boot for $20 that they fill with their delicious frozen Sangria. Bring the boot back and refills are only $10!   The staff here are so nice and helpful too. On our last visit we were going to each have a glass of wine and the lady told us for a few dollars more we could buy the whole bottle. You don't have to tell me twice! Grab a seat outside, either by one of the many oak trees, or under the shaded pavilion and enjoy the beautiful surroundings."

There are a bunch of wines to sample as well as one champagne and their famous sangria slush (my favorite).  The ladies are so helpful with the samplings and very knowledgable about the wines and where the grapes come from (not all can be grown on site due to certain bugs and climate reasons). I was very intrigued that they decanter their wine when you buy a bottle. I have always heard of this but have never seen a place do it. We were able to taste a wine before and after decantering and WOA what a difference!! I'm not sure why more places don't do this  This is a fun place to get away to with the country feel and relaxing atmosphere."

                "description": "So this was an absolute lovely vineyard.  We really liked the grounds, the out door gazebo and the building.  The furniture made of wine barrels was really nice.  We paid 15.00 for these really tiny tastes. We didn't really like their wines and do not enjoy sweet wines. We ended getting 3 glasses of their Sangiovese. Total bill was over 50.00.  This was pricy for a tasting and 3 glasses.  Normally if you end up buying glasses most wineries don't charge especially if the tasting pours were so non committing I don't think we even got through our tasting before deciding just to buy full glasses. So you should Be a little more generous with your pours if you are going to charge 15.00.  You all need something a little dryer and bolder."

It is not available to the public but available to those that participated in last years stomping event. People are very friendly and outgoing. The different wines are delicious. I like all of the reds, especially the Black Spanish Dark Red Lenoir 2012 Reserve , which has a nice bold berry flavorI am not a fan of white wines but their French Colombard is amazing. It is a great light summer wine that is soft, fruity and mellow and so is the Spanish black and white wine. The vineyard is a great place for weddings and parties. It is a very quiet and restful place."

It's covered with trees so mostly shaded but I thought it was really cool that they had misting fans going for muggy hot days like today.  If you're in town and want to hang out with the girls or spend time with your significant other, this would be an amazing place to come and try something new while relaxing.  Everything was also labeled: sweet, red, white, rosé, and even organic. I didn't know organic wine was a thing but apparently it is and they have it.   The guy working today was not the nicest. He barely said anything and didn't really help us out much. It seemed like he didn't want to be there."

                "description": "This store/wine local is in the center of Gruene. It is across from Gruene Hall and Mozies restaurant.  The store is filled w wine glasses and coasters (other items relating to wine) w funny quotes. They have a very large variety of wine that they sell by the glass and by the bottle.  We got 2 glasses of their \"best seller\", the Texas Southwind Blackberry Wine and one of my friends bought a bottle ($29) bc she loved it so much. Each \"glass\" was $9 and it came in a small plastic cup. I have an eye for a serving of wine and this was DEFINITELY short. Our cup wasn't even HALF way full.  Unfortunately, they do not do offer Wine Flights. I'm not sure why. This could be such a great addition to their business. They have a huge variety of wine. It'd be nice to try 4-5 wines and then be able to buy a bottle (or 3 ) of your favorite wines to take home w you. IMO, they are hurting their business by not offering flights. If we had been able to try more wines and not have to pay so much for each tiny glass just to TRY the wine, I'm sure our group would've walked out w more than one bottle.   There is a small courtyard next to the store where you could just sit and drink if you wanted to. There were numerous dogs w their owners. (So, dog friendly! ) We chose to walk around w our tiny glasses  and find a place w live music. (and find a place that offered wine flights...lol)"

We visited on a Saturday, which it wasnt too busy, and enjoyed people watching while waiting for a table to become available at the Gristmill.  I enjoyed the frozen sangria and my husband enjoyed a beer while live music started playing outside in the court yard. Great weather although a little warm for a fall day in October. They did have misters and a bar outside so people didn't have to go inside if they didn't want too.   Plenty of parking nearby. Clean restrooms. Friendly and Quick service."

We did not partake of their wine but on a hot October, Saturday a cold beer or two was in order.   The beer line moves fast and there is a good selection of local and corporate beers. Masks are required indoors while you order and the outside tables are set pretty far apart.   There is a good-sized shaded courtyard with live music (on this Sat afternoon). We opted for the people watching section by the street and we were not disappointed.   Like most places in Gruene everything is a bit overpriced but if you know where to go there are good (nontourist priced) deals. The Grapevine is a cool place to hang while planning your next stop in Gruene."

While there was plenty of out door seating, and a live band playing...definitely still crowded.   Drink wise...we got the frozen wine-a-rita - sangria and peach bellini......very sugary.. but very good if you like sugary drinks. Also kinda on the pricier side for 2 slushy type drinks after tip.  You'll probably make your way here while waiting for your table at the Gristmill to be ready."

Just thought I would throw that out there since most people like to go to actual wineries when up in the hill country region. This is a super cute spot (that can get extremely busy) where you can sit outside and enjoy sipping on fermented grapes while listening to live music. It's dog friendly. It's family/children friendly. There are plenty of seat options outside. And it's very reasonably priced! Especially when you consider that your 3 wine tastings are FREE. I recommend!"

If your stopping through Gruene,  this tasting room is a great spot to stop and enjoy a glass of wine."

It is my favorite place to go, especially this time of year when the weather starts to cool off they will light up a fire pit. It is the perfect place for a date or group of friends to hang out. Before ordering, you are aloud to taste three wines. There is a wide selection to choose from with categories: sweet/dessert, red, and white. My husband and I usually will take one small sip of our glass and then switch so that we can try six and then buy a bottle of the one we love the most. They give you the option of having a chilled wine in a bucket of ice. In the summertime, we will do this with one of the sweeter wines. Our favorite thing to do is to get them to open the wine and bag it, then give us two plastic cups. This allows us to carry the bottle around and sip on the wine while we walk around town to the different shops."

My friend and I had gone in for a tasting to see what might be tempting.  It never hurts to buy a bottle of wine, right?  Well, it was fairly crowded, being such a beautiful day out.  However I have seen it busier.  Anyway, we had walked up to the counter and were greeted and asked what we would like.  We took a few minutes to decide and got our sample.  A little dry for me, so we got another.  Now a few minutes have gone by as we've been standing there.  People come up to the counter and get help.  We finally decide what to get and the person who is been helping us keeps on walking by, as she is helping others.  But there are a few other people working the counter, including a gentleman less than four feet away.  Well, we stand there, just looking, waiting for someone to help us.  That help never came, so we decided to walk out without a purchase.  It's always important to keep track of everyone that comes into your business.    Because I did like the wine I will be back at some point in the future, hopefully to get the bottle that had caught my attention."

The customer service here cannot be beat. On a weekend day, you will find it to be a happening place, but you won't be waiting in line as you would expect. Sometimes they even have Peach-A-Ritas and Frozen Sangria!   The Grapevine offers a plethora of bottled wines for sale, or you can buy a glass..   There is ample seating outside of the Grapbine building, where you can enjoy a glass of wine, beer or maybe you bought a bottle to share. They will give you a bucket with ice to keep your wine cool in.   The bathroom situation can get a bit tight, as there is 1 male restroom and 1 female. But there are plenty of restrooms available at Gruene Hall which is not far at all.   I like that you can open a tab, so you can grab a beer or glass of wine, walking around Gruene and shop, then stop by when you need a refill.   I was bummed they no longer offer any of the wines from Val Verde in Del Rio, but the waiter did suggest a few wines for me to try that were comparable.   They also have small cheese and cracker boards available."

First, all the wines are made by natural fermentation (aka natural wine) with organic grapes- this winery is even featured in a Natural Wines book. The owner is so friendly and also has the sweetest dog. The decor is unique, interesting, and definitely sets a mood. The wine is delicious- we had a bottle of the \"on-site-only\" Lambrusco Pet-Nat, and we bought a couple others to-go. All the local websites were advertising Dry Comal Creek as the only local winery (and I'm sure it's great), but we stumbled upon La Cruz de Comal because Dry Comal closed at 5 and La Cruz was still open until 6pm. We will DEFINITELY be back for more organic, natural wine!"

The tasting room looks like a little cottage nestled in the French countryside.   The owner/winemaker, Lewis, is a piece of work. One of the most intelligent and yet one of the most obscure and eclectic people I have ever met. A true pleasure to meet and chat with.   Do yourself a favor. Check out the hours and plan to visit this little piece of heaven. You will be thrilled and so glad you did.   I highly recommend!!"

When we drove in, right away we noticed the winery's main building and it felt like we were in France. It is an authentic European building, small and cozy and welcoming!  The owner was there to serve his 100% estate grown grapes which boast of no additional acid, sugar or sulfites to his wine. The owner, who is a retired lawyer, Mr. Dickson, calls his wine, \"real wine.\" We tasted four wines and our favorite was the port, it had a smooth and delightful finish. There also is a sweet winery dog who loves to visit with the customers...we had a relaxing time there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to taste \"Real wine.\""

                "description": "I decided to take a trip and visit this place. I researched all the vineyards nearby but this place not only had the highest reviews, it seemed to have a nice scenery. The interior and exterior has french touches to it and you can tell each piece was well thought out.   Now the wine.... my husband and I FELL IN LOVE. At first the prices seemed to be pricey but once you do the wine tasting, you'll know why. The wine is so pure and has so much grace you have to walk out with at least a bottle (we bought three). I like wine but I'll only drink one glass because I get dizzy but when I went hope my husband and I both finished a bottle. The wine here has no sulfites and you can just taste the purity of the grapes.   Pricing: When you buy three wines the tasting fee is waived for one person ($15). The owner gave us a discount so after one wine tasting fee and 3 bottles of wine we paid around $160.   The interior is just lovely here you can just tell each piece in the room was placed there for a reason. The bathroom outside looked very old so I was very hesitant to use it but one you go in it is so cute and was not uncomfortable at all.   So, overall this place was an excellent experience!"

It is very obvious the owner should have stuck to being a lawyer. I understand the all natural thing. But it was awful. I tried to like even one of them or even find something interesting about at least one. With all of the time spent in Napa Valley and in France you would have thought the wines would at least be palatable. The only thing I can figure out is most of the reviewers don't drink wine. And if your thinking about going to see for yourself...I'm being nice in my descriptions."

                "description": "I love everything about this place! It's a hidden gem tucked away in the hills just south of Canyon Lake.  Lewis, the owner, is a former big-time defense attorney in Houston who found his calling to be one with the grapes and wine. Listening to him wax poetically about what he's doing differently at his vineyard gives you insight into what you're about to experience. He's also a hoot!   Instead of using commercial yeast, the wines ferment from wild yeast/bacteria on the grapes and whatever bacteria is in the HillCo air. This gives the wines an obvious farmhouse character (mild funk/horsey, slightly sour). He doesn't filter so the wines are a bit hazy and have some sediment/yeast on the bottom.   Grapes are either grown on-site or purchased from farms in the Hill Country and they don't add sulfites.  If you like traditional wines, you might not enjoy the wines that much but I still think it's worth a visit.  Tasting: $15 for 6 samples Bottles: Range from $25-$60 Times: Tasting room is open on Sat and Sun from 12p-6pm. What we bought: a bottle of Rose.  The tasting room is an adorable limestone building and the vineyard can be seen from the windows.   If you can't make it to the vineyard, Jester King Brewery just started carrying their wines in its taproom! It's a match made in heaven! Wild yeast for everyone!"

The tasting pours were generous and we enjoyed learning about the differences between their preparation methods versus the larger, more commercial vineyards.  I have to assume it's those differences that led to such pleasant flavors.  I've always been a red guy but found the first white I've enjoyed here.  Another first, I could really discern the various ingredients/flavors in each glass of wine, and the reds didn't have that strong bite to them.  I've been to Napa and Senoma, as well as France and Italy, and I just haven't ever enjoyed the taste of wine as much as I did during our trip to this little winery."

We just parked, shared a tasting and left in about 15 minutes because we felt kind of unwelcome and found the wines to be awful. And we wanted desperately to love this place, because it is GORGEOUS. I'd have been very easy to please to be able to spend time in this beautiful place. But the owner was kind of frosty, barely spoke to us (but was more vocal with others), didn't tell us anything (not even the names) about any of the wines. I complimented him effusively on the place when we first got there and tried to get him to chat during the tasting, but he didn't thaw. I don't know if we made him mad because we chose to share a tasting?? We would've gotten a glass or two once we found a wine we liked. We felt like we weren't wanted, which when you're sitting at the little wine counter right in front of the guy, is really uncomfortable. I could've ignored all that if one of the wines worked for us, but I hate to say it, we thought all 4 were terrible. We drink a lot of wine, not cheap or sweet ones, and none of these tasted like anything we've ever had before. I'm confused that every other reviewer LOVED them and we had such an opposite reaction. We are at a loss for the experience we just had. The winery is so so beautiful though, it rivals CA wineries. So bummed. :("

After visiting wineries in Fredericksburg/Hye/Stonewall area, this one falls a little short. The wine itself is okay, but I didn't like it enough to buy a bottle. The building is a little strange, as is the decor inside. There's a lot going on in there. There were tons of kids running around which for a kid-free date weekend sort of dampened the mood for us.  I failed to get her name, but the young woman behind the bar serving was working hard, helped all the customers, and was courteous and friendly - probably the best thing about this place.  All said, we do not regret the visit, but there are definitely areas for this business to improve on."

There was 3 meads on tap, raspberry champagne on tap, and a plethora of wine and meads by the bottle available for tasting or a glass.  They do sell growlers, so you can enjoy the tapped mead and champagne at home. I was impressed with the meads and champagne. I did not try any of the wines.

They flavors are so complex and have underlying subtle flavors that come out as well.   The meads are really sweet and very smooth.   The wine tastings are 5 tastings for $5 which is an amazing deal. Their selection is somewhat limited so if you go with someone else you practically get to try everything they have.   The only downside is that t is out in the country, and looks a bit shady... But they are expanding so it's starting to look more legit.   If you're ever in Seguin area, I definitely suggest this be one of your stops."

The cranberry orange spice is a must try for the fall season.  Our server was nice, knowledgeable and made good conversation.   We'll definitely go back.  The only recommendation that I would make to the owner is to put chairs at the bar.  The tasting room opened earlier this year so that may already be in the works."

My girlfriend and I both did a tasting, of which I bought a bottle of the Black Lotus (amazing) and my girlfriend tried both the ports.  She ended up getting a bottle of that.  We also got a bottle of the strawberry mead to drink there on the property.  It was a perfect start to our wonderful valentines weekend we spent in San Antonio.  We will definitely be going back and telling our friends about this wonderful spot!"

                "description": "Located between New Braunfels and San Marcos is a beautiful and quaint little gem named Gruene (\"Green\"). Gruene Historic District is embellished with historic buildings, antique stores, specialty shops, quirky restaurants, and beautiful landscapes. It is small enough to walk by foot, but big enough to discover new things to do and see for an entire day. There are restaurants for coffee, pecan candies, ice cream, and even pickles! And there are shops for toys, unique t-shirts, plants, and pottery. The possibilities are endless.  There are a few unconventional hotel and cottages conveniently located nearby that are walk-able distance. Otherwise the drive from New Braunfels is about 10 minutes. I came here on a Sunday and there were quite a few people walking around, but it wasnt so crowded that I couldn't feel a breeze. There are also plenty of street and parking lots scattered throughout, but there is a main lot located near Got Toys and Typsy Gypsy."

I love old historic buildings and this is the perfect place to come learn some history and see how well they preserved their town. Tons of restaurants, wineries, and little shops to explore. I wouldn't say it's necessarily kid friendly but a nice romantic getaway or girls trip would be perfect here. Everything is within a five minute walk of each other which was nice.  Parking was easy for us to find, the biggest parking area we found was behind the grapevine winery so I would head there first before wasting time circling in front of the store you wanna go into."

                "description": "Too much traffic and too noisy (not talking about the music). I was born and raised in New Braunfels and now live only 20 minutes from the city. We come to Gruene often, to shop and/or eat. Recently we stayed for a couple of nights during the week just for a get away. We stayed at the Gruene Mansion Inn which was fantastic. Gruene itself, however was awful. I walked early in the morning and it was like walking on the side of the freeway. The traffic was non-stop, including big trucks. Cars were moving fast. I had to run to cross the street, in between cars, no one stopped. After my walk (probably around 0800), I headed back to my room and noticed that there were lawn workers cleaning at Gruene Hall with leaf blowers. At around 0930, we walked to go shop and they were still blowing leaves at all the shops in the area......lunch at Mozie's......still blowing. Tried to go back to our room at 1300, still blowing. My husband tried to take a nap at 1430, couldn't because of the leaf blowing. It was ridiculous! Not so cozy or peaceful."

                "description": "It's pronounced, \"Green\" Gruene is a historic district outside of New Braunfels, along the Guadalupe River. It's an old Civil War era cotton town that was once somewhat of a ghost town. It's bounced back with tourism!  Gruene is a place to go to hang out for an afternoon, and take in the antique shops along Gruene's main street. They also have a wine sampling spot. The Gristmill is a great place to get some German food, and then head to Gruene Hall for some live music at Texas' oldest dance hall.  Gruene, Texas was founded in the 1840's by German settlers. The entire area is all German. The downtown area is mainly made of old brick buildings that have been restored. They're cool architectural designs that make up the shopping district. During Gruene Market Days, local vendors come out for a public market in the streets. As far as I know, you can't really go tubing through Gruene, as it's a bit out from all the tubing spots. The water comes rushing through here, and it seems like it might be difficult to tube it here. Try closer to downtown New Braunfels."

My friend and I were early coming back to Austin from a weekend getaway in San Antonio on a Sunday afternoon.  Being newish to the area I wasn't familiar with Gruene.  We saw the highway signs advertising Gruene, and usually my curiosity gets the better of me and I will find myself driving out to these places that end up being nothing.  However, Gruene is the first time the signs haven't lied.  My friend and I fell in love instantly with the magic of Gruene's historic wooden downtown main street buildings.  There is something for everyone here,  restaurants and cafes galore, an amazing historic music hall that has some fantastic bands regularly playing, little boutique shops, a winery, a wine tasting room highlighting the best of Texas wines + a couple of beers on tap, numerous adorable BandB's, outdoor market days highlighting local artisans, and of course the token water tower.   I recently spent an afternoon here enjoying the market days, tasting great food, and sipping some great wine.    Time moves a bit slower here, and even though you are 45 minutes from home, you are on a mini holiday."

I was unenthusiastically greeted by a girl who acted as if I was bothering her by coming into get coffee. I was asking her questions about the place and what they had and she was incredibly rude and continue to answer my questions with one word answers. No smile ever came across her face and she really made me feel uncomfortable as I was just trying to get some information about the store. My family is really big on cigars /coffee/ whiskey and I was very disappointed in the customer service or lack of customer service. I decided to push through and continue with ordering a coffee and when I asked her for a dry cappuccino she proceeded to roll her eyes and told me she didn't know how to make it and asked me what a dry cappuccino was. When I asked her \"isn't this a coffee place?\" she said \"I don't know how to make the coffee I just push the buttons\". As somebody that has been a barista and worked at a coffee shop I tried to explain to her how to make it and she just increasingly became annoyed with me. I decided to scratch the dry cappuccino just ordered a double shot of espresso which was awful by the way. As I continued to try to make small talk it was very apparent that I was not welcome there. I even asked her if she wasn't having a good day because of the way I was being treated. As I was paying, I asked her if there was a place that I could leave a review for the store she looked me dead in my eyes and said no. I confusingly asked her, \" oh you don't have a Yelp?\" She straight up told me no. As somebody that has worked in customer service I have got to say this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and I would never treat a customer the way that I was treated. I just hope that the owners can see this and know what goes on in their store when they're not there because if I was the owner of the store I would want to know about one of my employees making people feel very uncomfortable And not being helpful at all. I made several attempts to try to turn this experience around and give her the opportunity to create a pleasant experience for me but she just acted like I was interrupting her day of sitting on the stool behind the counter. Customer service was awful coffee was awful she didn't even know how to make a dry cappuccino. If I were you I would steer clear of this place it's not worth it."

The gentleman behind the counter, Steve, is super knowledgeable about his beers and stogies. If you enjoy the nicer things, here is your place.  Better pricing than other places on both beer and cigars.   This place intentionally protects it beers and cigars from harmful UV light by putting reflective tint on the front windows and the right amount of illumination inside. That shows seriousness in what they do."

                "description": "Short visit reaped great rewards.  Mr R had called ahead and been told they had no snack bar/restaurant on site but standard cheese/fruit/charcuterie were available for tastings.  Circumstances changed and I arrived alone at the tasting room's last hour of business. No offer of munchies but the employee was personable, knowledgeable, enjoys his work and I got to taste some *great* stuff in short order. If I'd arrived earlier I'd have asked about a few solids or in hindsight packed a bento box of them in the car to visit between flights.  In wines I tend towards dry, Pinot Grigio's what you can always find at my house and usually in my glass. I also love mead, although what I've consumed over the years is quantum territory compared to my impressive wine quaffing.  I tried four meads and one wine, enjoyed them all. A tasting of 5 selections as I got is $15 and you get to keep the glass. Took home traditional mead (drier), raspberry, Oatmeal Monster, and Vermentino (a drier white wine).  Seriously, if you have a friend who likes sweet wines, you have a shower or other small party on your calendar, come stock up on this oatmeal monster. It's like drinking an oatmeal cookie, it's ridiculously satisfying and giggle-inducing.  The drive's less than 40 minutes from San Marcos, it's near 123 in Seguin not far off my usual path to my parents' and the landscape's as nice as any in this part of Tx. As I said, I didn't have time to wander about on an extensive tour but it looked nice. The map option through Yelp was quite sufficient to get me there easily for a first visit.  They have events throughout the year, the wine club (quarterly delivery/pickup) has no membership fee and I think I'm going to sign up for it. Bottles start around $15 each and there are discounts offered on certain labels/quantities; I saw a few postings for those. The facility's nice if you are making an event of it and there's reasonable parking for split parties to meet up here.  What more can I say? Highlight of my day and now I have new hostess gifts or treats for myself stocked away."

                "description": "So, really I am surprised that this meadery exists in the middle of \"nowhere I'd be going randomly\". My mom has been getting into making mead with the fruit trees back home and so, when in Texas, try Texas Mead. Again, this place is way off the beaten road so unless you're aware of their existence, I'm not sure there will be too many coming here.  To start, it was nice and quiet the day my mom and I stopped in, which meant that we got the undivided attention of our hostess. She was highly informative and gracious. My mom had many questions on account of making mead herself, so I just quietly sampled my mead.   Mead is traditionally quite sweet, so if you're not much of a sweet person, find yourself to the wine menu with some drier options. (Yes, along with mead, they have wine here.) The unfortunate ending to our tasting was that the tasting was not comped upon purchase of bottles of wine. (Hmm, maybe with time an popularity this one will go?) Anyway, small gripes, small gripes. So, there is definitely a selection if you're not one who is traditionally into mead.  The last little tidbit I must relish again was their \"Hopped Mead\". My mom and I decided to drink a glass outside, wandering the winery, and it was incredible. Think somewhat sweet mead but carbonated (that doesn't happen often folks) and hopped for taste. It was so good, my mother bought a growler and we went on our way hoppy. And maybe a little loopy."

Owner, Paras, great person, super knowledgable, and way cool. It was Friday night and he had about 6-8 bottles out for samples and gave recommendations on best ways to drink and mix.

Last time we were in, we ordered a build your own pizza that included a plethora of delicious meats and even topped it with truffle oil.

We did a flight of beer so we can taste a multitude of what they have to offer. The Peanut butter stout was amazing. The only complaint was the copious amount of flies swarming us, lol. We tried not to let them bother us but they were drawn to our food.   We probably would have stayed longer but the heat and flies got the best of us. We ended up going to a different place to day drink. I think it would be even better during the fall, winter, or the spring."

There is a second tasting room where you can get flights instead of full tapped beer-that area houses the main brewery area.

Everyplace in NB was packed out and GBC was no exception but it was for good reason, thankfully we didn't let our hunger or the crowd deter us because we would've missed our big time!   So they have two separate building you can order beer at, and a pizza building, pub fare building and taco shack all surroundings common outdoor seating area.  I will say the beer selection and quality was amazing, They had so many unique flavors full of body, light to dark and low ABVs all the way up to 15%! Im so thankfully they weren't 90% IPA which seems like the trend nowadays but truly had a large variety as selection to please everyone.  Their cider was perfect my tart and not sickly sweet like every cider is, super refreshing.  The food was no second fiddle either, and held its own not just against the beer but other rival restaurants with similar fare.  First of pricing is really good so you're not gonna break the bank. Also you get a ton of food for what you pay.  But the icing on top is that the food flavors are soooo good, we had the cheese curds, blue cheese burger from the pub food building at it was honestly one of the best burger ive ever had.  The pizzas were equally as wonderful and had some awesome combinations you don't normally scene but they have them down. We got the one with corrizo and it I think is one of my favorite pizzas now!   This place should be a regular watering hole for everyone! although it's outdoor seating the trees, canvas overhang and mister make it bearable and they really have an ambiance that make you wanna stay and hangout, especially with the live music in the garden patio setting.   As a suggestion/request I will as the business owners to blessed put up some fans! Not just for the heat but the stupid flies especially in the smoking section were super annoying!"

It was our first visit since they expanded and it's even better than before. Same great expansive beer options with a lot of new outside space. They also have a separate small batch only bar and overall, their prices are very good. It's also dog and kid friendly and all the people that work there are very friendly."

                "description": "Guadalupe brewing is one of our absolute favorites, and they keep expanding and somehogetting better and better. Amazing flavors and unique beers for every taste ranging from light pilsners to heavy stouts, hoppy IPAs or sour berlinerweiss. They have unique flavors such as dreamsicle, and If they advertise a flavor in a beer it'll definitely be a leading flavor and not slight hints! They have an outdoor seating area that is gorgeous, and an inside area as well. They also have two different bar areas to order from- and some beers are only at one bar and not the other, so check both before you choose! You can get reservations for a week in advance, so they're great for groups/special events. They also serve pizza which is so good! They offer normal or Detroit style, and is an absolute must!"

                "description": "As a native Detroiter and lover of Detroit style pizza, I can honestly say that the Detroit Style pizza here is the best I've had in Texas and possibly Detroit. I had a simple pepperoni pizza and it was absolute perfection 10/10. Better than Via 313 in Austin, which I hold as the standard by which Detroit Style pizza should be measured. One pizza was enough for one person, and I really wanted to order and second but I resisted."

We've even slung beer for them on occasion to help out with events and goodwill.  From a \"closet\" with an outdoor grill on Friday nights, to a full dining and entertaining establishment,  Anna and Keith have never lost focus of their dream even all through Covid they have persevered.  The latest additions of a awning over the beer garden and customer laser engraved new tables to sit, three food choices including a new boffo pizza kitchen, you can't go wrong to stop in, relax and enjoy their hospitality.    Parents... there is a posting on the GBC website, please leave your minor children at home after 7pm. We don't see a lot of adherence to this request and this insults your hosts by being rude and reflects badly on you as a guest.  \"Prosit\""

The beer selection is one of the top tier places. I appreciate the live music and crisp cold beer. They have live Texas country music for MULTIPLE times a week. Along with an amazing food as well. I have attached a opening, videos and photos for Sunday morning, and food menus, hours (for food) and more. Hours for the brewery is open tue-thu 5-9 fri-sat 12-9 sun 12-6. The pizza is made with their fresh garden vegetables that you can see them picking tue-thu 5-9 and fri-sat 12-9 (peep my tik-tok, which isn't my thing but it's cute)"

There was guy playing live acoustic music on stage for a short bit. I got 16oz pour for $7 with nice, friendly bartenders. The low rating is for the food. It was not good. Not the burger or fries nor the service from the lady that look the order. The food was cold, salty, and the burger was all toppings and little patty. I'd definitely return for some drinks and the atmosphere though."

First, a bit pricey on flights ($20 for 5 beers).  What really annoyed me today was we sat in the nonsmoking section and a worker (owner?) kept coming through with a really pungent cigar.  Multiple trips through and even lingered by us as he smoked.   Totally nullified my ability to taste the beers.  On the bright side, as well as awesome beers, the young man seating guests was super nice and attentive.  He even suggested we move to a cooler spot (the non smoking section haha).   Anyway, mixed experience.  Hence the 3 star rating."

I sampled a couple of the sours and they were ok, but again, just not my cup of tea, so I won't judge them on that.  Staff was very friendly, very knowledgeable about the different beer selections.  The clientele that we hung out with and spoke with were also very friendly and cool.  Bar area was kind of small but there is also a bit of seating back in the brewing area.

We decided to stop by and see what they had to offer.  It turned out that most of their beers leaned toward the sour end. Sours aren't necessarily my favorite, but I was intrigued by the pickle beer. (Not a fan.) However, they had some dark sours that were actually delicious! This was our third brewery of the day...so that may have influenced my taste buds, but no matter...I still enjoyed them. And the anniversary party was hopping and it seemed like a lot of people love this place.  We'd like to go back and check them out on a non-party day, just to see what they've got.

                "description": "Dear city of New Braunfels:  I hope you understand what you have here. New Braunfels brewing Co is in my opinion, one of the best breweries of Texas, definitely the best when it comes to sours (in my humble opinion).  I am gonna go ahead and sound like a pretentious douche, but my husband and I are huge fans of sours, and we have been to over 60 breweries around the country. This one is absolutely a keeper.  The brewery is ran by a family that lives in town, they do everything from cutting the fruit that goes into their beer, to brewing and marketing, so don't expect fanciness, a very small group of people runs the entire show. They are usually very good about updating their menu on facebook.   Remember, this brewery specializes in sours, you will not find the regular styles like Lagers, IPAs and Stouts and such. If you are looking for anything other than sours, please skip it instead of giving it a bad review.  The tap room may be tiny, but it's packed with awesomeness and flavor. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable, and they are always ready to help you and tell you all you need to know about sour beer.  This brewery is not a place to hang out for a long time with your friends, but more of a place for doing a quick tasting and take some bottles home. This is absolutely not a good place for large groups.  I recommend that you buy a flight, which is $8 for 4 small pours, that way you can taste different things. If you want to commit to just one, the prices are very reasonable.   My favorites are Saison de Nefle, Hell yeah! and PKL FKR.  We like their stuff so much that we bought a membership to their club, which is totally worth it."

Very friendly staff were quite informative.  Only the second time I have tried a sour, first time at Jester King and I did not like. They gave me a free taste and off I went.  We quite liked the sours actually better than some of the wheats. We tasted 5 of the 8 taps and liked all but one.   The sours are like a double fermented beer inoculated with live bacteria and can be quite puckering. Some are barrel aged up to a year.  If you're in town I highly recommend stopping in. You can even wander around the small brewery on your own.  Oh btw, they will pour you a cup to go. New Braunfels allows open containers, drink up!"

I had the Jose rosé gose after sampling a couple of others. Nothing was extremely sour, so this might be a good starting point for someone new to sour beers. Very knowledgeable, friendly staff."

Really small inside area, but a nice little beer garden out back. No food.   Also, importantly, if you don't like sour beers - I wouldn't make the trip. That is what they specialize in, and every beer on tap is some form of sour except one."

Yes 5stars of delicious suds. All top notch quality. Impress your friends or woo some opposite sex by taking them here for good times! All the beers I tasted I would buy in a store."

They don't change the website, but to quote the guy pouring, \"nothing in life is a sure thing\". I'm pretty sure the \"on tap now\" list is supposed to be a sure thing. Thanks for not only being a Dick, but for wasting my time.   2. All of the beer follows the ode if a little spice is perfect the whole bottle must make it better. Not good. I tried 6 of the 8 beers hoping for one I could finish. NOPE   First clue I should have just turned around was the bartender asking me if I was hungover.  (Nope, but thanks for telling me I look like s°~×  before saying welcome to our brewery)   NEVER AGAIN"

                "description": "We had an accidental run in with this brewery. We happened to spot it as we were getting out of our vehicle on our way to another place. The open sign was calling us, and for it being past 8:00, finding a brewery open that late is unique.  The tasting room is fairly small with a few bar stools and a bench in the brewing room. They  invited me to go in the brew room to take pictures.  These brewers are some of the nicest we've met so far. Great company and conversation. They even recommended some other local businesses, which I now have bookmarked.   The beer: they specialize in wheat beer. That's not typically the style of beer I enjoy, but I did find one called the \"Hot Child\"- a cucumber and jalapeño infused beer. We only had time to have one beer as their tasting room closes at 9:00. Currently their tasting room is open Thursday-Friday 5-9pm. I hope to see these guys at Wurstfest someday."

Not for everyone, but they have a place indoors to chill on hot summer days. I'd fire up the pit on a summer night, if they would let me.    They do change the beer menu quite a bit, but they do have there regular beers. Staff is friendly and helpful. Sorry, no beer flights, and I see why, you don't want to get something your not happy with, plus they will give you sample.  They have a kitchen, we've eaten her before, so I can only recommend what we have tried, the pretzels, the pizza, and the bratz.    Now they are about to open a coffee bar, can't wait for that."

                "description": "So what do you do if you are off the beaten tracks outside of SA.. roaming around from New Berlin to New Braunfels and looking for a bit more  action .. Yelp actually points me me that there is an actual brewery in middle of nowhere, just drive through some windy roads to get there.  Well that seems like a fun adventure on a Saturday afternoon.    Little did I know that this little brewery would be located in the middle of a preserve.  This is where hiking trails meets beers. No masks need rules just some friendly owners ready to talk beer and God's country.   Well let me back up a bit as the hiking part is not quite is not quite available aw of 2021.  But the owners of this wonderful property own all of the acres of this incredible property so maybe this may become the next latest and greatest thing since yoga and beer drinking came to be..  I loved everything about this place.  It was spread out so you could find a spot without being disturbed.  They had picnic tables to hang out under the trees, even rocking chairs for grandma. Totally open to all age groups from the kiddos to oldies but goodies.  Normally I'd not want what could be described as chaos in a normal brewery setting but with the beauty and spaciousness everyone seems to get along and make it work.  Kids and AA/NA 'rs are drinking the hibiscus tea while the majority are enjoying a freshly brewed beer.    Beers are a nice mix here. They have nice light options for the Texas heat like a 4.8% Pilsner kolsch Hefeweizen and orange juice infused pale.  Then they get more serious going to a stout w/marshmallow graham crackers and coco nibs and get all the way to a 9% imperial stout with blackstrap molasses that comes regular or bourbon barrel aged. Those only come in a 6 oz pour which was appreciative considering we all do need to sometime and head back to civilization...  I loved all of the beers especially the Pilsner as it was so refreshing in a hot day.  But even the darker beers were super smooth.  I also loved how they gave you taste tests before committing.     They even gave a bit of entertainment going on with a guitar player on the outdoor patio.  Kids were dancing and adults hanging out with their pets. Yep i didn't see anyone not having a fun time, especially when most people have been deprived so to say over the past year, cough cough:D  This was a great find for us venturers, and I wholeheartedly recommend you bring your friends and family to this wonderful scenic treasure.  Yes Beer does exist in God'scountry. Say Amen to that .."

Off the beaten path of 1863, snuggled in the countryside with abundant outdoor seating and space for dogs to play and kids to run. There is shade, which is nice but an inside area for those triple-digit days. There are outdoor fire pits for when the weather is actually enjoyable in Texas.  There is usually an on-site food truck on the weekends. The beer is very crafty and creative. My first 2 visits were very excellent. Recently, my trips have still been enjoyable but a bit disappointing. While I admire the creative side of their brews, I do not care for everything to be fruit-infused. I don't mine 1 beer being fruity, but when that is all there is to choose from (other than the Kolsch) it gets old, fast. When I first was visiting this brewery I loved their porters. I haven't seen them in months. I think I would frequent this place like i used to if there were more non-fruity options.  Other than that, I love how it's family-owned, a large, open space, and just a relaxing atmosphere. Hopefully some non-fruity porters or ambers show up soon so I can head back out."

The beers are fantastic with a wide range of both familiar and eclectic styles. You can get 5oz pours of anything, enabling you to try quite a few without getting too tipsy.

Great event! 5 stones is a Christian brewery and apparently they do these live music events several times a year. This one was live Christmas music and awesome beers (and some wines) in an awesome outdoor, family friendly (including the dog) environment that caters to the ability for social distancing. What a cool experience. I was only able to try two of their beers, but both were delicious! I highly recommend both Merry Christmas and Toby G's. All of their beers and made with seasonal ingredients. The Merry Christmas is a fairly typical style Christmas Ale, but delicious. The Toby G's is a family pecan pie recipe made into a beer. Sounded strange, but I love Pecan Pie, so I tried it. So good!! I will definitely come back to this place. Hopefully I'll get to try more of the beers next time. A friend was telling me about a pineapple jalapeño beer they do in the summer time. Sign me up!!"

And when we do ask questions,  get a short or sarcastic, (looking annoyed) or condescending answers.  People much friendlier at Krauses.  Shame, this place is so much closer to where we stay."

If you like something, you can build your own 6pack. If you wanna stay and try things, order the pretzel or the biscuits. There's no wrong answer- though the hot chicken one is hot- be forewarned! (Think hot wing sauce)  they also have some sort of slushee that I meant to try but I forgot because I was distracted by a \"sour IPA\" and some other interesting things I wanted to try. Try them out, taste some things or wear your mask and build your 6 pack to try at home!"

It is dog and kid friendly, and a nice place to just sit and enjoy the weather. On some weekends there is a food truck, so that is nice.  Overall the place is clean and very welcoming. There is a lot of bottled beers and ciders to pick from and just a small amount of beers on tap. While I understand that space is probably an issue, I wish they wouldn't carry local beers like Faust on-tap. If I want Faust, I can drive over there. If more taps were available it'd be fine but I'd rather try something else local but not from the same town."

The new place is awesome,  there is a large bar area and seating inside and out. They also now have homemade foods and snacks.  They have the same great selection of Texas beers and a few more.  They also have a huge selection of can and bottle beers you can either drink there or take a six pack home with you.  You will have to try the fire sale (I think that's what it was called). The bartender picks out a beer or hard seltzer out of the cooler, it's fun like a spin of the wheel to try something different.  They now have Sangria Slush which tasted very good and it is also made in house.  I felt very comfortable there, you wear a mask unless you are sitting to drink and eat, they use social distancing, very clean. and the restroom was also very clean.  I felt very safe with the pandemic going on."

That ahi tuna was the food highlight of my weekend. Ever since COVID, I've been having the hardest time getting quality tuna from restaurants but this dish was perfect. The crunchy slaw added a nice contrast to the to the tuna and sauces. I loved the combination of the multiple sauces. I would drive from San Antonio to new braunfels just to get that tuna appetizer.   I've had the Mac and cheese from here before a few years ago. I remembered it being good and it is! It ended up turning into 2 meals, it's a good amount of food. I like the noodle shape they use and the addition of the veggies. The additional Parmesan toasts on the side are so yummy. Can you ever have too many carbs with cheese?"

Looks like I'm too early for the Oktoberfest brew again, but good enough reason for me to come back.   The German Nachos are killer! You can beat the beer cheese and the brat is delish.   The pretzel bites are a must with the zesty beer cheese."

                "description": "We went to The Faust for an early New Year's Eve dinner. It was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised with the service and food. Our server was Maddie and she was fabulous. She was also made our drinks and they were top notch. She got my husbands tequila on the rocks order right and made a very good Mexican martini and French 75! She definitely made our evening great. We had the perogies and German nachos for appetizers. The perogies were excellent, we really enjoyed the shoestring onion rings on top. The German nachos also were excellent. I had the beer cheese soup and French dip. The soup was very good, I was disappointed with the french dip. I think it just couldn't compare to the nachos and perogies. My husband had the corque monsiuer with fried eggs and was very impressed. My son had the Faust Wellington and was also very happy. We will be back soon and highly recommend!"

My wife had the Tuscan sandwich and it was to die for!!!   I had fries and my wife had kartoffel chips.  Both very tasty.  So glad a friend recommended this place. Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. Oh yeah they brew beer too but we don't drink so can't speak but if they brew it with the same care as the food I'm sure it's great."

They have a really nice outdoor patio area with large picnic table style seating, indoor seating at the bar, and also indoor seating in the \"hangar\" right alongside the brewing equipment.  Their beer selection/variety is good, and the staff are VERY knowledgeable about what the have on tap.  If you are looking for a certain style of beer, ask them and they can probably find one to suit your taste.  They will also give free tastes if you are not sure before purchasing one.    Great local business - show them your love folks!"

                "description": "Wife and I had about 2 hours to kill prior to picking up the kiddos so we found this place and checked out the hotel prior to going in for a bite. Very cool hotel with an awesome decor and super cool phone booth.  So Luis was our server and he provided very efficient and prompt service. There were several other employees there who were kind of hanging around the bar (bartender + other employee) not really helping out despite 3 tables (7-topand Two 2-tops) walking in within 5 minutes of each other. It was a seat yourself kind of place so I guess none of those tables were in their section?  Anyhow, we got everything ordered and the bartender brought me my beer; kind of a drop and go situation. When I ordered my second beer she tried to deliver it to the table next to us so I'm not sure what was going on.   Food was pretty solid. Reuben was amazingly good. The Russian dressing was made from scratch and had a little spice to it.   The Croque Madame was sinfully delicious but a lot heavier than I anticipated.  The egg yolk really rounded off that dish and would be necessary to complete it. I couldn't have imagined that sandwich without it.   It was a solid experience overall. Decent beer, efficient service, but nothing really blew me away. Wouldn't complain about going back; but wouldn't crave/seek out either."

They were all so unique and different packed full of flavor and fun. Our waitress Carson was extra sweet and seemed to make it a priority to make great small talk.   I had the Diablo burger and paid extra for a premium side. They make their own tater tots and they were filled with jalapeños, cheddar cheese and cream cheese. They had a little extra crunch to them but were like nothing I had before.   We shared the apple pie cheesecake which was also good. I would not call it great and a must have but I also think that is because I may have overeaten my meal because it was so divine."

That's why we are continuing to take precautionary measures to ensure proper sanitization and minimal contact for all your orders.\"  Given this statement it seemed odd that no one in the place (except for me) was wearing masks, and the tables weren't spaced far apart. I would be very uncomfortable dining in here. But my order was for pickup.   I ordered a Caesar salad. The online menu says there's a balsamic reduction, but it was nowhere to be found. That's unfortunate. The salad was a decent size. The dressing was good. It seemed like it was yogurt based. It needed something. Maybe more garlic, or some salt.  The Parmesan crisps were a nice touch, and weren't mentioned on the menu, so maybe they took the place of the balsamic reduction. It's a fair trade off.   I'm on a low fat diet due to some recent health issues, so I think the rest of their menu is off limits for me."

They definitely have different things that make you explore and try new things! I was iffy with my Diablo burger but man it was the best combination of sweet, spicy, and meaty! The chips with queso was ok, the chips were a little stale and queso was clumpy. The service was amazing, friendly, and swift. Everyone was happy to help and knew their menus pretty well.

Wait staff was friendly and efficient.   We stopped here on our way up to Austin to celebrate our anniversary. I went with the Mexican Street Food Burger, I think that was the name? ‍ Anyways it was a burger that had a bunch of things on it including Mexican Street Corn. It came with fries which I upgraded to Poutine Fries because why wouldn't I on our anniversary it's time to celebrate. Wifey got Shrimp Tacos with pickled onions on top and I believe some kind of Asian style seasoning. Her meal came with fries as well which she said were good but once she tried my poutine fries she quickly wished she upgraded. We shared my fries because hey it was our anniversary and I'm a nice guy (sometimes).   Overall a good dinning experience. Would reccomend and would return."

Arrived right at five and seated very quickly on the cute patio. Service was quick, and my mouthwatering burger arrived promptly. Definitely lived up to the hype, stuffed with creamy pimiento cheese and stacked high with all the good, non-healthy stuff. Just the right amount of spice too, more about flavor than intense heat. I devoured it quickly because the bun could barely hold it all and I just couldn't resist. So tasty.  Also, the service here was so amazing. My sweet waitress came out to tell me they were fixing my order to get me the sweet potato fries I ordered instead of regular fries. I hadn't even noticed the mistake! I ended up with both sets of fries, and then they didn't charge me for either to make up for their mistake. Superb customer service that sealed the deal for me. Going to recommend this place highly to everyone I know. Hoping to try another burger here soon!"

Great outdoor space, but it was thunderstorming while we were there.   $17 for a burger and fries is pretty steep though. I got the Scape Goat and the thin beef patty didn't even come close to covering the bottom bun. Disappointing for a burger at that price point. It was flavorful though. Parmesan aioli fries were an up charge; they were pretty delicious.   Basic cheeseburger was deliciously messy and the side salad was beautiful!   We tried the Muck Mule, Peach Sangria, and I had a sample of the Flamingo Fruit beer. All were very good.   Give this New Braunfels gem a try when you're visiting or just passing through!"

The wait was kind of nuts but you are welcome to walk on over to the bar and find some outdoor seating while you wait for a table. It did rain all over us because they don't have a legit cover for outdoor seats but all of that was forgotten when the food came out.   Their fried green tomatoes and onion rings are phenomenal. The burgers were HUGE and they did not shy away from any toppings or condiments. One of our burgers came with an entire bowl of queso to dip or pour. I got a burg with jalapenos and it was so spicy, I had to take some off lol. Delicious meal and very kind service."

The last day Schlitterbahn was open, we walked right in and got a table at about 645 pm, so it might be slowing down a bit so locals can stop by. We live in Converse and will be back!  We were so full and could not even try the amazing desserts!  Next time..."

                "description": "What can I say about MandF?   The ambiance is hip yet comfy.  You can dine inside or out.   The restaurant is clean. The employees are nice and they're good at their jobs. It's close to the Comal river. Now, the food!  Muck and Fuss (don't say it too fast or you'll end up throwing an f-bomb) has SUCH good food!  They have a nice variety of dishes like; appetizers and gourmet burgers, sandwiches and tacos, \"boozy shakes\" or not boozy shakes, and cheesecake for dessert  (unless you want a cocktail for dessert).  Speaking of cocktails, their cocktails and craft beer are SO tasty (and strong) and will get you in trouble if you're not careful. The only complaint I have is the prices.  A couple can easily develop a $50 tab for lunch.  In south Texas, that's kinda pricey. The hub's and I have eaten at MandF a number of times and the meals are consistently yummy and the employees are consistently great.  We just don't eat there as much as we'd like because of the cost. Even with the high prices, I recommend Muck and Fuss!"

                "description": "The only unpleasant part of dining here was finding a place to park on Memorial Day weekend. We were told we would have to wait an hour for a table of 5 but ended up waiting only 30 minutes or so. We were seated on the patio but had shade and a breeze, so it was pleasant until it threatened to rain, and the host very politely let us know and set a table for us inside. After we moved, it downpoured, so that was very thoughtful!  Our server was very sweet and attentive. We never had empty drinks, and our food was all delivered timely and was hot. I ordered the Scapegoat burger with a side salad. I shared some poutine with my sister. And we got some chips and queso for the table, which was delish. All the food was really good. The Scapegoat with its gooey and melty goat cheese paired with pepper jelly was excellent, great flavor. I should have tried the Asian slaw. The side salad and dressing were good (and fresh), but there isn't much to write about it. The poutine was amazing. It has a mushroom gravy, and my sister hates mushrooms, but she actually loved the poutine.   I didn't get any alcoholic beverages, but it did look like they had a good tap list and some fun cocktails. Note they have Maine Root sodas, so if you are a die-hard Coke or Pepsi lover, the soft drinks are a little different. Two members of my party didn't really care for them. The iced tea was good.   Overall, prices are fair, service is top notch, and the food is worth whatever long wait time they may have!"

                "description": "Great place for food and drinks. They offer cocktail and beer flights. They have a long list of beers to choose from. We tried both. The cocktail flight was perfect. It was a margarita, a mule, sangria and the prince solms sipper.  For food, I ordered the special of the week. It was a sandwich with pimento cheese stuffed fried avocado and a side salad. It truly was perfection. I did also try their Mac and cheese and it was super good. I guess I love cheese and everything I ate had it.  On a Sunday for brunch, it was busy, but we only waited about 20 minutes. We did get seated at the bar. It can get tight, but so worth it.   They have inside and outside seating."

Either way, this is a cool, low key joint. Best part is that they serve both wine AND coffee! They are the same company as Wicked Voodoo Coffee, and its super interesting that they have a wine and coffee bar. I love it! The concept and the place is so unique. They also have legit charcuterie boards. The staff here is also extremely sweet and nice. Great customer service, amazing ambience, and a great place to bring friends. They also have a private seating area if you wanted to reserve for a large party. If wine and coffee are your jam, this is a perfect place for you!"

I really can't explain how detail oriented they are towards picking the right blend of foods that go so well with their wine offerings.  The bartender/host Stuart was AMAZING. She helped us navigate our flight of wines and has almost perfect recommendations.  I would come here everyday if I could.

Then there is Melinda, who was primarily taking care of us.  She was subbing in from one of their drive-thru locations due to being short-staffed, and she was flat-out nails!  Great personality, extremely helpful, and just a lot of fun to talk with. My wife did have the munchies and ordered the bacon donuts, not really reading the description...obviously missing the 'mountain' in the title.  This is enough to feed Joey Chestnut...a huge pile of freshly made rings, topped with bacon and a sticky-sweet glaze...with a side of healthy fresh berries.  My wife has breakfast for the next few days. Great wine selection...coffee smelled great, but did not have any (got a bag of beans to go), and truly outstanding people... We will go out of our way to visit again, for these experiences, even in today's climate, are rare. You will not be disappointed."

Crazy to see them now downtown in a large, beautiful space. Sadly, the beer is, I think, still mediocre. Everything seemed watered down and missing something. Their Heffe and Oktoberfest just didn't taste like that type of beer, and the Pecan is just meh. I was disappointed to see the beer hadn't improved over the years. However, if you do come here, the pizza is phenomenal! There seemed to be only one guy working the kitchen (bless his soul), but he was turning out pizza after pizza and they were so good! I have the Sleek Blue Ribbon and oh man! Drool! I love pesto on pizza but usually it takes place of the red sauce, which I don't like. But here, you get both = win!  I'd say it's worth a stop, but if you're a hardcore beer snob, it may not be to you liking."

I believe they also offer some other drinks such as margaritas and wine. The space is pretty cool with lots of room and a hip look. They have TVs to watch the game on. We visited on a Saturday and the service was good and the place wasn't too busy - although it did appear to be busier when we walked by later in the day. There is a kitchen in an adjoining space that serves up some brick-oven style pizza, though we already had lunch plans, and therefore didn't partake - but it looked really good! We enjoyed our visit and would consider a return trip if ever in the area again."

We stayed in budget and my party guest paid for their own adult beverages. I feel the need to add this information because the staff did not make it seem at all to be an inconvenience and were so accommodating.

I honestly had never heard of mead until coming here so mead at breweries is rare. The BlackBerry mead is delicious and almost tastes similar to wine. Customer service is always good and very friendly. The environment is super chill. They have 2 TVs and right now during the Astro vs Red Sox game it is $3 pints which is great for beer drinkers. I've been told you can bring food from other places and eat it here. It is also dog friendly and that is a huge plus."

                "description": "This is a must stop place for us every time we're in New Braunfels! We've been for brunch, lunch, and to enjoy beers and apps. Honestly, my favorite time to come is for brunch, especially when it's nice enough to sit outside. The ambiance is amazing: brews, live music, and great brunch! Our first time here was for a Mother's Day brunch, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy wonderful weather and got to sit outside and hear some live music! Their avocado toast is delicious: kale, sprouts, and eggs however you like them. It's perfect if you like healthier fare. Some of the skillets and schnitzels are more popular, but I'd honestly get the avocado toast again as it was THAT good.   We most recently came here for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner and really enjoyed it! For starters, the service is amazing. We showed up with cakes, cupcakes, and an ice chest full of ice cream. The wait was an hour long, but they sat us quickly when they realized how much stuff we had brought. They kept the cake in the fridge for us and provided candles and a lighter, which was super nice and helpful! The service alone is reason enough to come back: they truly go above and beyond. For dinner, I ordered the grilled salmon and my husband had the TX BBQ shrimp. My salmon was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the potatoes! The shrimp was amazing - I wish I'd ordered it! It had a good amount of heat to it as it also has andouille sausage. It's definitely worth ordering!  As a side note, this place can get PACKED on any given weekend and doesn't take reservations. Something to keep in mind during peak hours if you're coming starving. Overall, can't recommend this place enough if you're stopping in New Braunfels. It's truly a must-do!"

                "description": "The place is very spacious with a beautiful mural on the outside - I was surprised at how packed with people it was in spite of how large it is. Definitely very popular. The outdoor seating is ginormous! You could tell they were busy but still Emilia, the manager , who was acting as hostess and all around hands on, was very sweet accommodating all who came to her. She was very quick to meet everyone's needs.   I sat at the bar, thanks to Emilia (the first waitress I encountered at the bar was very rude and actually told me there was a wait for the bar and I needed to se Emilia... she was wrong, bar's open seating as in all places). Cynthia ended up being my server. She was wonderful and quick to take my order and check on me for drinks, etc.   They were out of the Wiener schnitzel, which was the reason I originally went, so it was very disappointing. While the ambiance and space and food were great, I was a bit disappointed at the fact that they didn't have such a signature dish so early in the day (noon). I ended up getting a jager schnitzel which felt a bit dry / over fried, but the mushroom sauce was delicious! It was tasty but I'll have to go back and see if it was just bad luck. The fingerling potatoes were well seasoned and delicious. I don't eat boiled cabbage or sauerkraut, but I tasted it and seemed pretty authentic.   They did have quite a varied menu of both food and drinks and most of the waiters and waitresses seemed to be very on top of service. I'll definitely be back in hopes of getting a Wiener schnitzel and maybe try a few other items."

They brought out a cast iron pan with cubed raisin bread swimming in a puddle of butter and sugar. I'm sorry, but in my opinion bread pudding should hold together when removed from the baking pan.  This rendition seemed like cubed bread slathered in sauce.  Where is the cream or milk?  Where were the eggs?  I don't know what it was, but I can't call it bread pudding.  The hot cocoa was hot but not much else."

                "description": "We had to try a German restaurant in New Braunfels and everyone said this is the place to go. They have a huge outdoor Biergarten and even the \"indoor\" Bierhalle is essentially outdoor, with mesh walls and sky high ceilings. Dogs are not only allowed, but encouraged, both in the Biergarten and the Bierhalle. There were several there when we visited and they were all very well behaved.   We ordered a ton of food here, and liked all of it. I'm not usually a fan of shoestring fries, but the ones here were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The broccoli was also prepared perfectly, not over or under cooked. The red cabbage was pickled, making for a unique but very good dish. The Apple fritters were the highlight of the evening. More closely resembling a corn fritter than the Apple fritters you would get at a donut shop, they were crispy on the outside, soft inside and came with a delectable dipping sauce.   A couple of complaints. The live music (a Biergarten staple) was WAY too loud. We had to lean right up to each other's ears to talk to one another. Also, although our main course came surprisingly fast, we had to wait forever for the dessert."

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this restaurant and the rating it has on here fits it well. It is not horrible but not overly fantastic. I can see this as a place to hang out with friends for a beer and finger foods.   The day we went there was a farmer's market so we were occupied while we waited the 45 minutes it took to get a table. I am guessing COVID restrictions play part in this, which is fine. The beers are good! I lived in Germany (Heidelberg, Ketch, and Kaiserslautern) for over 12 years and my husband is French and German, born and raised in Schweinfurt, Germany. Going to German restaurants are a treat for us because we like to compare American German restuarnt to the originals. All American German restuarnat cater to the Bavaria region of Germany and this one does a great job mixing both American and German style foods.   I had the Texas schnitel, which I did not care that much for. My husband had the German meatball which was amazing. The brussel sprouts are some of the best I've tasted since moving here.   In all, this is a fun place to hang out with friends and family. They have live music, which I would have hoped was traditional German, but hey! I do see myself visiting a third time."

The cheese sauce was fantastic and I enjoyed the honey mustard as well. My son and I split the German meatball with spatzle. The meatball wasn't very hot but it was good. Nothing spectacular but it was good. Good size portions. My boyfriend ordered the Texas schnitzel and it was ok, a bit dry and over cooked. The green beans were ok and the mashed potatoes were way too salty. They would've been great with less salt. The beers we had were the liters abd they were served in a huge mug. Those were perfect."

My favorite things to eat here: rueben with chips (so so good), soft pretzel with beer cheese, and the kartoffel poppers!  They have a ton of beers on tap, you're likely going to find something that you enjoy. They even had an Apple Pie Mimosa today and it was delicious. There is tons of space outside, and the beer garden area. (Only downside is that when they have music it is LOUD) I've never eaten on the real inside before, it's never been an option so I'm not sure how to get a seat in there?  The only reason for 4 stars is because service is consistently poor. I also tried 2 desserts today and was disappointed in both.

We waited for 15 minutes later and had to flag down a server. For the third time in a row we were told that there's a limited menu for no good reason other than the \"kitchen is slow.\" So no kartoffel poppers.....the best item on the menu. After bringing appetizers we waited 40 minutes and were told by server that she forgot to put in our order.  The manager (Sabrina) was unapologetic and asked if everything else was timely. What else?? No entrees came out and nobody asked if we wanted more drinks.  Don't waste your time here...and it is a waste.   Last few visits have been bad. Its a shame. This place used to be good. Lots of room to make something better in New Braunfels. Owner needs to wake up. Great spot but going down hill."

We were both disappointed and decided to find a place to eat to salvage the night. That's where AquaBrew came in. The environment of AB is warm and comfortable. The service is nice, attentive, and happy. And the food and beer...  My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork sandwich- the spicy slaw was delish. Both were really tasty and hot, fries were crispy and salty. The IPAs were delicious with the food.  Definitely looking forward to the next chance I have to go back."

When we walked in we were very disappointed in their craft selection. I had researched this prior to choosing to go there based on their craft choices showed online. Again, something else that needed to be updated. Also, they aren't serving food. There was a large dog walking around that would come right up to you or sneak up under the tables and lick your feet. I like dogs so it was ok but for someone that doesn't..... Would not go back here until they get fully moved or opened."

                "description": "They've thought about everything at this brewery.  Great food, live music, seating inside, outside, and UPSTAIRS on the deck!  When the weather is right, they have the big glass garage doors open.  Yeah, they brew their own beer here and they have a decent selection.  It's not your typical brewery where you can just stroll in and choose the table you want to sit at.  That's because they have full table service for food and drinks.  I prefer breweries that let you wander around from the bar, to an outside table, to an inside table, and then back again - you know, rinse, lather, and repeat (relaxed and unstructured - I need that once in a while).  If you just want to stop in for a quick beer, you can sit at the bar.  The bar is quite large but also very popular with the college crowd, so it's hard to get a seat at times.   Now to the serious stuff - the beer!  I've had their Kolsch (San Marcos Blonde) and their Vienna Lager.  The blonde was the run of the mill Kolsch, not bad by any means, but the Vienna Lager - wow!  It had a great malty taste to it.  I liked it so much that I purchased a crowler of it to take home.  I rarely do that, so that tells you it must be good.  Enough useless banter - here's everything else you need to know about this place:  Free parking lot right next door or free 2 hr street parking.   Patio areas in the front and the back with overhead infrared heaters and fans with misters (they have both Texas seasons covered).  This place is popular with the college kids - TOO popular.  Growler refills are $12 or $18 for 64 oz, and $24 or $36 for 128 oz, depending on the beer you select.    Crowlers to go:  $8 or $10 (depending on the beer).  You can get three for $20 or $25 (depending on the beer).  Plenty of food options.   And I almost forgot to tell you - they have a FULL bar, not just beer!"

                "description": "Aquabrew is definitely a gem in San Marcos. I learned about it through the purchase of the brewery tour on Groupon. The tour was quaint because it's not that big, but very interesting.  The gentleman who gave the tour seemed a bit rushed at the end, but he answered our questions and seemed very knowledgeable.   At the end of the tour we got to sample some beer. They also have a beer club where you buy a growler, we got the one for $100, and join their beer club. You get a punch card for 10 refills on the growler. My husband and I got one each for $200. I was thinking it an \"okay\" deal i guess. Truthfully I wasn't that thrilled cause of the price. But OMG!!!! IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY FOLKS!!!!.   Aquabrew has some of the best beers around. I am Army and have lived and traveled all over the world and this lil place holds its ground when it comes to beers! Purchasing the growler is the best deal too.   I have not had the food yet, but the place is always busy and people seem to love it. And they have some of the cutest guys behind the bar.  In all, I give this gem an A+"

This place really has a community feel with longer style tables and an incredible open patio with fans and lighting, ping pong and live music... and of course... beer.  The food was very flavorful. Thai chicken had good spice and the chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The Margarita flatbread was fresh tasting. The arugula salad was huge and bursting with fruits and flavor.  The beer was excellent and just what you'd expect from an onsite brewery.   Overall, if you're looking for a fun place for you and your peeps to chill, eat and drink in San Marcos... you'd do well to try this place. Plus it's right up the street from the Cheetham St warehouse."

Long tables instead of individual tables to encourage people to meet new people ! Which is a really awesome concept . Also there's a large bar since it's also a brewery.  Food- my food was about a 3.5/5 , but my friends was a solid 1. Her salmon Benedict had almost uncuttable biscuit since it was so hard , and the most burnt potatoes I've ever seen. My food which was the stuffed French toast was pretty yummy, but not a lot to it.  Noise level - 1/5 THE BAND WAS SOOO LOUD. I couldn't here my friend talking 1 foot in front of me :(  Price - 2/5 wayyyy overpriced for what you get. My French toast was 11.91 and my friends meal was 15.91  Probably won't return unless it's for a group outing , but still a cool little place to check out !"

Easy to get a seat and our waitress was very attentive, despite it being happy hour and slightly busy on a Friday after work.  As a table, we ordered the: a) Brew House Pretzel - Amazingly soft and the beer queso is a great pairing  b) AB Bacon Jam Fries - HOLY! The bacon jam itself is something I've never had before and I must say this makes it a must return for me  c) Glass of Imperial Pilsner - Smooth and pretty standard for a Pilsner  d) Glass of Artificial Intelligence Tripel (9.72% ABV) - Yeah...the ABV tells the story itself  This spot has a great atmosphere, very rustic and cozy. Definitely a nice place, just wish you could order directly from the bar for faster access to beer."

I wish I saved room for the Porter Ice Cream Float.   The AB burger was solid, maybe a little messy tho.  Forget the fries tho. The regular fires were under seasoned and chewy. Think Wendy's fries when you  don't finish them at lunch and try to eat them at the end of your shift. Bleh  The staff was super friendly.   The outdoor portion looks great but a bit too hot out today to go and enjoy it."

                "description": "You know when someone takes a picture of themselves and posts it on Instagram,and it's at just the right angle to make them look super attractive? The Yelp reviews of this place kind of remind me of that. It's not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.  The highlight of my meal was the Mosaic IPA. Balanced and drinkable, this beer was really enjoyable. I also tried the Swine Dive IPA. The taste of this was a little too clean for an IPA and just didn't have the hoppy depth to add to its character. Not bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall the food I ordered was really lackluster. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't a memorable meal. My chicken empanadas were oily, and had very little chicken in the filling. The whole thing struck me as more of acorn dog egg roll hybrid, and didn't really seem like an empanada at all. I was grateful for the spicy sauce it was served with, which was pretty tasty. I also ordered the brussel sprouts. There were some decent flavors here, but I would have really preferred them to have a little more char on them. They came across as slightly undercooked and worse yet, very wet. A little crispness would have gone a long way.  Service was fair, friendly enough but really on the slow side. It took me almost a half an hour to get my food and it wasn't crowded. The couple at the bar sitting next to me ordered hamburgers. I have to admit I was a little jealous because they looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe it was a bad night. Whatever the reason I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

But the reason I come to AquaBrew and recommend it to everyone I meet is the food. The \"new\" salmon dish isn't even close to the goodness of the previous balsamic salmon with veggies. Dry. Lacked flavor. Sticky rice instead of the delish potatoes and only green beans instead of a mix of seasonal veggies. Hubby had the tostadas and 'meh' reaction. Will give it one more try before relegating it to happy hour only place with 3 stars. So sad."

I was so excited to try these fries but they were very underwhelming to me. $4 is steep for an up charge but had I enjoyed them I wouldn't have minded. The burger was the best bite on the table. It was small in size but very juicy and tasty. Not one to split.   Next up was the fried chicken and eggs. It has so many things I typically like - fried chicken, cream gravy, bacon jam, eggs, but I didn't like this dish. It lacked dimension of flavor. It needed something. The herbed fries that came with it were good. I liked them better than the $4 bacon jam ones.   Our kids split the stuffed French toast. The only ate a little bit because it was too sweet. If a kid thinks something is too sweet you know it's toooooo sweet. Neither ate it. It was a waste of money.   Overall I'm glad we tried it but don't need to return on our own accord."

We saw a guy walk from the kitchen with a bottle of what looked like vodka and went outside to their outside area and was playing around.   The food was DELICIOUS!! My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork sandwich. He for regular fries for his side and i got a sweet potato. We weren't a fan of the regular fries, so I highly recommend the sweet potato.   We also ordered the mimosa flight and were kinda impressed. For $20 you get a whole bottle of champagne and 4 different flavor options. We chose chipotle pineapple, watermelon, passion fruit and lavender. All amazing.   This place is spacious. The food is amazing. I was just unimpressed with a few waitstaff/bar staff members. We went next door to Chances afterwards and they mentioned the management has gone down hill.   I hadn't mentioned we aren't from the area. We are from Austin. This place had stellar food and for a night shift it wasn't awful. Give them a shot!!"

                "description": "one of my go to restaurants and it's a comforts place for me and my friends. whenever we have guests from out of town this is one of the first places i bring them because the food is so so good. i like how they use yelp to save spots in line so we don't have to wait there or go in person in order to join the list.  the cheese sticks as an appetizer are amazing, especially the marinara because it's like sweet.  as for entrees the balsamic ribeye is my favorite ever. the gorgonzola burger is also amazing, i think they changed it from when i first had it  (because the cheese used to be like really creamy and it was amazing and then i got it and it wasn't the same) , so i haven't ordered it again but the steak is my favorite.  i had a friend get the tortilla soup and she said it was the best she had ever had. the jalapeño crawfish chowder was really good but it was super spicy so i gave it to my dad.  as for sides their french fries are amazing and so are their loaded mashed potatoes.  i'm always so full leaving here and i don't think i've ever been able to get a desert but hopefully i'll eventually get to try one"

                "description": "We had a great time for lunch here! A nice casual ambience with minimal to average noise depending where you sit. The location is beautiful, sitting right on the Guadalupe River! Our server Bri was kind, knowledgable, and prompt. We enjoyed our experience overall.  My spouse and I split the balsamic ribeye and it was totally delicious. Cooked perfectly and so, so yummy! The 16 oz was plenty to share between us both and it came with a good portion of both the potatoes and green beans. Everything was stellar and we ate it all up! I would 100% recommend this dish (we had it cooked medium rare and it was *chef's kiss*).  For drinks - I ordered the French pear martini, which was yummy but quite sweet. I'd likely try something else next time we're here! My spouse ordered the Rattler, which was great! Tart, but not too strong. They enjoyed it and said they'd order it again.  A delightful spot in Gruene that we'd definitely recommend!   Bonus - they have a military discount, if that applies to you."

                "description": "We visited Gruene River Grill for the first time on a Friday afternoon, before a concert at Whitewater Amphitheater. We were very fortunate to get good parking spot and was promptly seated by the nice hostess.  We started off with a couple of cocktails, The Rattler and a frozen Margarita. Both were delicious. For appetizers, we split the Shrimp Wantons. Holy Moly were they delicious. Seriously, one of the better things I've eaten in a long while.   For our main courses, my wife had the Oriental Salad and I had the Beef Fajita Street Tacos. My wife loved her salad. The beef fajita tacos were simply fantastic.   We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area. The service was great, the drinks were refreshing and the food was delicious. 5 stars from me.  *Sorry no photos, too hungry to snag a pic!"

Not that you'd expect anything else from this dip! We all fought over the last creamy crunchy bite, oh yes, this dip is served with tortilla chips and it's gluten free for those that have an intolerance like me! The yummy wedge salad with added bacon and blue cheese rounded out my \"cheesy\" meal at GRG! Oh, I almost forgot, for those that like prosecco, they've got it! Thank you to our attentive servers, Carson and Alex! Now, if y'all could just make me a gluten free chicken fried steak ;-) Cheers!"

She was one of the best waitresses we've had in a long time. She knew the menu very well and recommended great food. The decor of the restaurant is very cool. I had the Gorgonzola burger and my husband had the Gruene chicken enchiladas. Both were very good. The enchiladas were a little spicy but not too much. The burger was also very good. I definitely recommend Gruene River Grill and Kerrington."

                "description": "My family visited GRG for lunch today and it was a disappointing experience. When we walked up to request a table, the host rolled his eyes when we asked for a table of 8. I suppose we were an inconvenience to him less than 15 minute into his shift? Although there were at least 5 staff members gathered behind the hostess stand - some talking amongst themselves, some on their phone - not a single one asked if we needed a high chair or booster even though we had a small child with us so we grabbed the high chair and two boosters and still not a single staff member offered to help.   Our waitress was kind to our face (and we tipped her as such), but not knowing my husband was waiting for us to get back from the restroom, she complained to her fellow coworkers about us loud enough for him to hear. She complained that we had children with us, complained that we mentioned our poor experience with how we were greeted and then rounded out her rant with a \"ugh, tourists\". We aren't tourists. We live 5 miles down the road. Even if we were, what a horrid way to be treated by the locals?   I cut my teeth in the service industry and this kind of service / customer experience would've never been tolerated. I understand children are frustrating to serve. I understand that nobody wants to be at work on a Sunday afternoon. But I learned as a waitress to leave my bad attitude at the door and at the bare minimum, show a little class even on days I didn't want to.   I'd strongly advise your staff to be a bit more careful in their treatment of your guests because in driving away your local patrons, you'll be reliant on those \"ugh, tourists\" they seem to dislike so much.   What a shame."

                "description": "I really wanted to try a steak house tonight so we ran across Greene River Grill and everything looked good. They served Texas size portions for sure! We ordered the trifecta appetizer, then I had the Balsamic Ribeye because I love ribeye steak! And Hubby had the Chicken Fried Chicken which is one of his favorites at other restaurants.   The trifecta was really good. I loved the salsa and queso. Hubby loved the guacamole (I am not a fan). The steak was good at first but then I noticed that al you can taste is the balsamic vinegar. The meat was tender but there was not flavor. The green beans and red potatoes were good. Green beans had a little kick to them. The chicken fried chicken was ok. Not really seasoned. Hubby added salt and pepper. The mashed potatoes and corn were REALLY GOOD!   Overall, we have plenty for tomorrow's dinner but we will try another steak house. May try to get something else here when we come back to shop."

                "description": "Gruene River Grill is a place for hanging out, great outdoor ambiance and great food! Oh and Gruene is sounded like 'Green'?!  LOL That threw me off by the locals around here telling us.  Going to Gruene downtown was a  small nice town with lots of lights on their streets and big trees, hearing bands play music and small local stores to shop.  Some houses were converted to bed and breakfast places or stores. Unfortunately, we came on a weekday but the place was still crowded.  The parking lot of Gruene River Grill was large and the parking was full but we got lucky. When dining, ask to sit in the causal river dining area versus indoor. We came at perfect timing before sunset and overlooking the river.   Our server was very friendly and hospitable. Love the Texan accent but I forgot his name to give him credit. They have the downloadable menu scan to see the menu.  This is common now since Covid 19 started.  They do have happy hours on weekdays from 3:30p-6:30p and we missed it.   With many friends to order, it was great to try every dish they had.  We ordered many things and these were my ratings of eat: Peach Bellini (5 - a must try as its strong and good) Cucumber Mojitos (5) Cesar Side Salad (4) Crawfish Jalapeño Chowder (5 - a must try!!) Redfish (4.5 - a little bit salty on some parts but flavors are good) Filet Gorgonzola Mignon (5 -  a must try as its tender and love the blend of this cheese on meat) Balsamic Rib Eye (5 - their signature dish) Country Fried Steak (5 - crispy, moist and huge portion!)  All dishes, sides like green beans and potato wedges were very well cooked. Definitely, come here to try their food and enjoy their ambiance as I definitely recommend them. [14th/100]"

We ordered the shrimp wantons, jalapeño pork chops, southwest meatloaf, the lobster chowder and a side of steamed vegetables for a weaning baby!  Everything was delicious, we both took home half our plates and had enough for lunch the next day.   room for improvement would lie in the bathrooms, no changing table and unless there were more bathrooms somewhere there's only 2 stalls."

                "description": "This restaurant was recommended to my fiancé by one of his coworkers.  We got to the restaurant around 4 on a Sunday and got seated immediately.  For an appetizer we had shrimp wontons, which I highly recommend.  I had a hard time deciding what I wanted for dinner.  There were a lot of different entrees that sounded good to me, but I decided to go with their blackened redfish with crawfish Dijon peppercorn sauce served on a bed of basmati rice and a side of Asian slaw.  It usually comes with vegetable medley, but I substituted that with the Asian slaw, which is a favorite of mine.  My fiancé had the 16 oz ribeye seared in butter and balsamic vinegar with green beans and garlic crispy red potatoes.  We had dessert as well and chose the banana pudding, which is one of my favorite desserts and their's was amazing.    We really enjoyed The Gruene River Grill.  The atmosphere was nice, our waiter was kind and very attentive, and it was a clean restaurant.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  They have a wide variety of different entrees for everyone, from tacos, to steaks, to seafood, and entrees with an oriental twist.  We are looking forward to going back and trying some different entrees ourselves.  As far as price goes, it was reasonable, especially for the portion size and quality of the food.  I've heard this restaurant gets pretty busy, and they do not accept reservations.  If you go on a weekend, I recommend going sometime in the early afternoon."

We had about 35 people for a 70th Birthday party which they catered for use. We were given the downstairs room which greets with a panoramic view of the river below (I mean DIRECTLY below!! It's amazing how steep the hill is)    Our 2 servers were absolutely amazing, friendly, outgoing and extremely courteous. They went out of their way to bring us food that was not originally on the buffet line to help accommodate picky eaters (the kids lol)    The food was out if this world good!! We had Santfe chicken, smoothered steal, mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was so tender I only needed my fork to cut through it!! Everything else was amazing and flavorful as well.    I can't wait to come back again!!"

Had the spinach and artichoke dip and that was pretty tasty as an appetizer. Overall this was a very good meal. Lastly finished off dinner with a carrot cake that had very good flavor. Overall I will definitely be back! This place does it right and had great customer service by Anna our server."

There was a line when we got there for dinner but it went fast. We were given a window table and it was a  breathtaking view. Of course, I had to try their peach Bellini. It was sooooo refreshing and gave me a nice little buzz. For starters, we had their home made cheese  sticks and bowl of jalapeno crawfish chowder. Both were very good but the chowder stole the show. My kiddo rated their cheese sticks \"the best she has ever had\". We figured if their appetizers were that good, the entrees were probably better.  Unfortunately, they were not. The country  fried steak was huge but it was bland, gristly with a bland and burnt tasting gravy. The corn that came with it was delicious though. My fried catfish was moist and fresh but bland yet again. The Asian slaw and fries that came with it were good though. The chicken Guadalupe, I was told was ok.  All in all, we liked this restaurant but might stick to appetizers or try something else next time. It is also worth noting that they are supporters of the Wounded Warrior Project and provide military discount as well."

We drove 1-1/2 hrs down to New Braunfels from Williamson County and it was worth it. I had the Sausage Plate, Weisswurst (veal) and Bratwurst (pork).  It comes with sauerkraut and the German Potato Salad.  The Potato Salad was awesome.  This potato salad is room temp and vinegary (you know if you have had German Potato Salad before).  It's not the creamy cold type you might get at a BBQ Joint.  Before the entree was served we had a cup of Cream of Mushroom Soup, very delicious. The menu is not huge but it seems to cover the range of faire you expect at a German Restaurant.  There is no children's menu or any Non-German dishes i.e. hamburgers, chicken tenders, etc. So everybody in your group needs to like German Food or be open to trying it.  We'll be back for sure."

Restaurant is adorable - love the location right by everything - super easy to walk to a bakery or around downtown   3. The food is DELICIOUS. From the rye bread, the schnitzels and sausages, and ESPECIALLY the black forest cake. Seriously, the best I've ever had.    Cons:   1. They run out of the Black Forest cake. Seriously. I went here on my birthday, and they run out of it at the beginning of the week usually. And it's REALLY the best. I hope they start making MOOOOREEE!   2. It's a little pricey, but the portions are huge and sharing is definitely easy."

Picked this place and really enjoyed the service and selection of items!  The rye bread was really great! Then I had garlic soup that was good. The Wife wanted to try the sausage sampler. They had the spicy mustard I like. The only problem I had is, I've never had jalapeño sausage in Germany!! Not my thing.  Then I had the Rinder Goulash that was really great, the Wife had Huhnerbrust Geschnetzeltes. Chicken breast with sautéed spinach with mushrooms that was good as well!  I really like the place. I wish Yelp allowed 3 1/2 stars. Would I go back, you bet!"

Firstly the series's great. The waitress was friendly and the place very clean. Beautiful ambiance perfect for a date or a couples dinner night. The food was good both my girls and husband agree it was yummy. All of our food came correct and hot. The beer was cold and the bread was fresh. Something to note while this is not a dress up place it's easy to feel under dressed. Also, this is a great place to try new things but the price is high and the options limited. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet dinner with good food. As far as the food it was a little salty but flavorful. The sausage mustard was to die for and the red cabbage was absolutely delicious. We left full and satisfied."

They forgot my side of spatzle and the potato salad was cold when I thought it was supposed to be served hot but we also came fairly late at night.

                "description": "My grandparents are from Vienna Austria. I grew up on authentic Germanic foods. The decor in the restaurant was nice and reminded me of my grandparents house when I was a young man. The service here was exceptional. Very friendly, very professional and well mannered wait staff. If you want a kind of modern take on this cultural fare then maybe it's good, but old school authentic German food it is not. First of all the Kartoffel Knoedel were more of a grainy mashed potato that was scooped into a ball form. If you've had legit potato dumplings you'd know that these are not them.  Spatzel was meh. Beef goulash with Hungarian spicy paprika. Kudos for using the Hungarian spicy paprika. But why the hell is the sauce tomato based with bell peppers? If that's what you're looking for then maybe not too bad, but again, not traditional.   Jagerschnitzel was okay. Sauce wasn't the greatest.  I didn't hate the place, it's just it didn't excite the palate."

Husband and I first discovered this restaurant during the \"Texas freeze\" back in February while staying at the Gruene Cottages (also recommend!); and it turned what would have been a sad trip to escape our lack of utilities into a lovely memorable date night. The restaurant was full throughout the evening, patrons being entertained by an accordion player that serenaded guests table side. A limited menu showing focus pays off, everything we have tried is delicious. Overall, a great neighborhood spot that we frequently visit!"

                "description": "This little cottage restaurant has the potential to be a absolutely great German restaurant. However, it has a little house work to do to get there. No doubt it has the charming ambience and Great German food of the best restaurants in the country.   Here is a list of minor items that needs to take care of first.  1. A vase of plastic flowers on the tables needs to have real flowers. 2. The bread needs to be changed to a better hearty German bread instead of the white bread with brown swirls. 3. Do not simply dump a small pile of foil-wrap butter pads, but have a real butter server with the bread. 4. The service on a Sunday afternoon was deplorable. The young man probably was a student from TSU in nearby San Marcos, working on weekends to make a little money for college. He did not repeat the orders from the four of us and therefore our food came all mixed up. He never thought to refill any of our drinks until we finally ask him to. He was a nice of guy  but just not trained to be a true sophisticated food server like this little restaurant deserves.  By the way, having a young singer with real lederhosen amble through the dining rooms singing German songs with his accordion was brilliant. This restaurant is truly a little gem that simply needs to be polished."

Surprisingly, the hostesses were very accommodating, and promised us the outside seating we requested \"in about 20 minutes\".  We were seated in five. Our server, Morgan, a lovely  young woman, a college student at a Texas University,  was impeccable in carrying out her duties, she gave us much better service one might expect on such a busy night as this was.  Everything was perfect, from the seating, to the food - onion rings, tortilla soup, the bronze catfish and the baby back ribs were all excellent. It was an amazingly wonderful experience made so by a diligent and attentive wait staff. Totally recommend the Gristmill River Restaurant"

They are currently redoing the back so all of the seating was inside.. they had a nice warm fire going.. great views of the river inside.  It did get pretty toasty inside thankfully one of the waitresses came over and opened up the windows..   I ordered the steak salad and my friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich..  The steak salad was good, there was a handful of the lettuce that should have been tossed out not tossed into the salad which is why this isn't 5 stars.. The steak was good super tender!  We both loved the chicken salad sandwich.. it's not sweet which made it different and even more delicious!  I almost forgot the onion rings! I would absolutely order those again! Only able to eat one so I'd order the small but sooo good and not very oily at all!"

It is as average as going to Jim's/IHOP (please don't be offended if you are a fan). But the price you have to pay for a side of onion rings (picture below), it was $11.99. Honestly, they were genuinely crazy prices for the quality and quantity.   The customer service is extremely bad. We were walked into our seated area. No one greeted us at a table until about 30-40 minutes in, and that's after we tried to get their attention. No one ever came back to check on us after the food was delivered, and we were even having a hard time to get the check. I personally wouldn't go back again."

This building is historic and used to be the cotton gin. I enjoy looking at the building every time I come here. I included a bunch of pictures so you can see the charm of this place.  I got seated right away but if you are coming on a weekend be prepared for a little bit of a wait. They do not do reservations so plan ahead. The good thing is that they have a ton of shaded outdoor seating if you have to wait. For an added bonus you can often hear the music from Gruene Hall.  I ordered the club with fries and it was great. Their fries are the best and I have never had a bad experience here. My wife also got the club sandwich and she loved it.   I have also done work events here and you can rent a room in the back. The service is always great which is nice being this is a tourist attraction.  If you haven't been here before then you have to put this on your itinerary while in Gruene. You won't regret it!"

                "description": "This was probably the coolest restaurant that I went to while around San Antonio area.  This was actually previously a factory of some sort many moons ago.  It looked as if not much was changed from the original, or they just made it look that way.  I have to say, if you like AC while eating then it's best to find another restaurant.  They have fans and shade.  So when you walk in, it's right in the town of Gruene (pronounced Green), you can easily park in the little towns parking lot and just walk (if you're able).  My aunt informed me to NEVER come on the weekend or you'll be waiting a very long time because it's a hot spot.  Off to the side of the building there are countless benches that have mist oscillating fans so you don't have to pass out while waiting in the heat.  They do have live bands that come for entertainment, and an outside bar to order drinks while you wait.  I mean, if you have all that in the waiting area then it really must be worth it.  Luckily we sat right down on the week day.  We were given the option to choose inside or outside.  We went for outside. Now this restaurant has so many levels and stairs that lead you to the back of the building.   The waiter was fantastic, the food was incredible.  All-in-all it was a good experience.  I didn't talk too much about the food because you're more so going there for the atmosphere, and Gristmill definitely wins."

                "description": "The Gristmill is an iconic restaurant for the Gruen (pronounced \"green\") New Braunfels (pronounced \"new bronzefels\") area.   I have been here many times and give the place 5 always because of location and ambiance and the he have had to -1 for food with the comment that sometimes the food is a five and other times it's a 3.   But I come back because it's a really cool place and when there's live music it's even more cool, yea more better.   I don't recommend the jalapeño margarita as it makes my lips hurt but I do recommend the jalapeño poppers because even tho they are hot the taste is so good you would eat them if they were shooting flames.   Have fun!"

                "description": "This restaurant used to be good. The amount of food you got was huge. They were known for their chicken fried steak. Well not anymore, it was tasteless.  The meat and gravy had no flavor. The green beans were good after you added the seasoned salt that was on the table.  It's a shame that the prices go up, portions go down and the quality goes down. The service was very slow. I found out the waitress was new and overwhelmed. We still gave her about a 30% tip because she was new.  I will say that the queso was good after we added pico to it.  Probably won't go back. So many other places are better for chicken fried steak."

Only thing that was bad about our experience was we had wasps wanting to come to our table the whole time.   I know it's hard to deter when you are drinking mimosas but just kinda downed the atmosphere some, the waiter seemed to help us though try to get rid of them, but not once did a manager come by to help even  though they walked by staring multiple times"

This restaurant is massive with nooks and crannies everywhere!! They also have an outdoor live music venue but unfortunately we weren't there foe the night life .. The food was delicious and the service was great  . If you go at night make sure to get in the wait list ASAP. We ate our food and then explored the town some to help digest all that good grub !! We stopped at a couple shops and got some ice cream as well !! I can't wait for our next trip to the river and this cool little town !!"

                "description": "We usually eat at the Gristmill every time we are in the area. It's pretty much our go-to. This last visit was on a Saturday evening that had a fairly big concert going on next door at Gruene Hall. We are anticipating a wait, but our quoted wait of 90 minutes turned into around 2 hours before being seated. Understandable as it's a busy place, but disappointing none the less.   We had come chips and Queso along with a frozen Sangria while we waited in the courtyard area for the text saying our table was ready. The snack was needed to keep us from getting hangry and the frozen Sangria was wonderful.   Once we were finally seated, we pretty much knew exactly what we wanted to order. No beating around the bush so to speak.   On this particular visit, we went with the Pasta Poblano Salad and the Beef Tenderloin Sandwich. They asked me how I would like the beef cooked. I requested \"Medium\" and they delivered. It's not your normal sandwich but man o man is it delicious!   It's summer time, peak tourist season. I fully expected a wait. I believe the staff was trying as hard as they could to get people through the door and to their table. I won't complain too much.  We'll definitely continue coming back to the Gristmill when we are in the area."

The rooms were all wonderful with the large fireplaces.   Our server was Chloe and see was very efficient and kind. My wife loved her fish but was did not love the round fries as much because she thought they were a little soggy. The crispy one were great. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was perfect. The sauce on the side was great. The mash potatoes were very tasty but could have been hotter. I love hot food. It is a issue I have with all restaurants.   This is a beautiful building and we will definitely come back and enjoy the river once COVID is over. I bet the outdoor band areas are great in the summer. All in all much more to love about this place than minor little things."

The bathroom was clean, and the venue was well kept. Things that need improvement is on customer service. Our server, I think her name was Lexius, was sweet, but I think she was overwhelmed. We were a party of 7 people, and she rarely came and checked on us. Our drinks were not refilled, and it took us a while to receive our paycheck. As I said, everything was okay except the customer service needs improvement. I would return."

This time we stuck to appetizers and were much happier. The Spinach Quesadilla was cooked just right with a perfect blend of spinach and cheese where you could taste the spinach, not just cheese. As good as that was, the Tortilla Soup was absolutely delicious! Spice was applied to give plenty of flavor without being hot, and the chicken was delicious, tender and juicy. Even the margaritas were good! Definitely worth the stop for a quick bite to enjoy the view overlooking the river."

                "description": "I highly recommend this place if you're in the New Braunfels area. My husband and I have been here twice already and so far they have not disappointed us. There is a wait but you can always put your name on the waitlist and walk around the Gruene area. Just a warning, they do not take reservations nor put your name on the waitlist over the phone.   We ordered the onion rings, spinach artichoke dip, and shared a medium well ahi tuna because their servings are huge. The onion rings are huge, good, and fresh out of the fryer. All of the items we ordered were delicious and recommended.   Lastly, the service was great despite it being a very busy Sunday. We sat outside - love the ambience of trees, the Guadalupe river and of course live music in the background. The small bugs are something we could not avoid due to it being summer time and the trees around so definitely bring bug spray.   Overall, I recommend this place if you're in the New Braunfels area."

                "description": "Had such a fun time at this beer tour!  We did the \"Everything is AleRYEt\" tour for $100/person - 11am-3pm.  We met around 11AM at Underground Pizza in New Braunfels. You pick from a customized menu for OffRhodes customers with a 2-topping pizza/salad/drink menu and receive your beer tasting glass. The pizza place gets their ingredients at the local farmers market. Definitely recommend the fresh mozzarella + bacon crumbles as toppings. So good!  The tour bus that brings you to each location has plush seating areas with plenty of room. It was cold outside when we went, but I believe when it's not sub arctic the bus is AC'd.   We stopped at three breweries: The Faust Brewing Company, Guadalupe Brewing, and New Braunfels Brewing Company. Got to see first hand the production process. We loved trying unique small batch beers you can't purchase in stores. Apparently I've been drinking beers that taste like skunk water so this was nice. Lol  We can't wait to do another group tour in the next few months!"

Then we went to New Braunfels Brewing Company. Kelly was really informative, and the beer was really good. Very friendly place. Next we hit Middleton Brewery. Loved the atmosphere and they had a real big selection of good beers. Last we went to Guadalupe Brewery. They had a different brewing system that was interesting to see. All the people at the breweries were friendly and informative. Our tour guide took good care of us and was very informative about each stop. We had just the right enough time at each stop to reasonably sample what we wanted. We ended our tour playing a giant game of Jenga, and relaxing, at a pub called Patek's in downtown New Braunfels before going back to our cars. It was a personalized, full day of enjoyment. The bus holds 14 people so it's a cozy group. I thought it was a great price for what was provided. I was told they have more than 1 tour. I'm going to go again after a few months with more friends. It was really relaxing and fun. Dress comfortably and enjoy."

My husband and I try to incorporate as many brewery tours into our trips and vacations as possible (yes, we love beer...like, a lot), and our day with OffRhodes certainly did not disappoint. A delicious artisan pizza lunch, shuttle service to three very personal (and personable!) hands-on brewery tours, plenty of tastings (yay, BEER!), and a professional, fun, and knowledgeable guide. Next time you are in New Braunfels, give these people your money! You will not be disappointed. Thank you, Chris, for providing a genuinely perfect beer lover's day."

                "description": "I chose to dine alone this evening. I used the Yelp app to help me decide, and Mako's ended up being the perfect location. I made a reservation; it wasn't needed, but I wanted to be on the safe side. I was seated quickly at a high top near the bar where I could still enjoy the peace of dining alone, with the background noise of quiet conversation from others and ESPN playing above the bar.   I'd made it just in time for the Happy Hour specials and decided on a $5 old fashioned and the $5 Gouda ranch wedge ($1 with grilled shrimp1). I added the butternut squash bisque after placing my initial order, and it was the right choice. The funny thing is I can't quite describe what made it tasty, but I cleaned the bowl! The salad was pure perfection...seriously...you canNOT go wrong. I'm not sure if it was the tangy pickled onion, the smoky lardon bacon,  or the perfectly grilled shrimp that made the salad so scrumptious, but I'm already planning my next visit for that one item alone.   Since I wasn't stuffed from my satisfying meal, I decided to indulge in dessert. I chose the poached pear with the Portofino wine reduction and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious, but SUPER sweet. So, if you're not into that, pass on this dessert. Even though it's a small dessert, it's perfect to share because it's probably too rich for one person (except me!).   This will not be my last time enjoying happy hour here; I've already text a friend to suggest this as a new monthly get together spot! Next time I'll sit outside!   Side Note: I definitely recommend the \"Smoked\" old fashioned made with star of anise, juniper berry, and mesquite chips. Ask to see a demonstration to add to the overall experience. It was a pure delight. It somehow took a simple $5 cocktail to the next level."

                "description": "I don't usually leave bad reviews, but unfortunately I feel compelled to in this case.  We ordered the butternut squash bisque, scallops, and paella.  Butternut squash bisque was basically flavored oil with some seeds... there was literally a layer of oil on the top when it came out... I still pressed on and gave it a chance though... it tasted ok at best... In general I'm a human vacuum cleaner so I ate the entire thing, but I would not recommend it if you're looking for an actual bisque/soup.  The scallops were tiny and it only came with 3.... The bed of risotto that the scallops were on had a very odd taste... not like an old taste, or like the food was rotten, it was just seasoned horribly. Again I stomached the entire thing, but the portion size was so small that I was done with the entire plate in literally 3-4 bites.... Total rip-off for the $34 price point.   The Paella.... my mom sent it back.. i tried it before she did though and I wouldn't have been able to stomach it. It was absolutely horrible. Terrible flavor, overcooked seafood, odd tasting sausage, and about 1/4 cup of rice... we couldn't even see the rice when the plate first came out because there was so little. Is this shrinkflation or just normal for this place? I have no idea...   I would not normally have even posted this review but.... After we told the server we'd be sending the Paella back, she stopped by the table that the owner was sitting at and let him know... He never came over to talk to us about it.... and when the server came back, she said the kitchen agreed that it was bad LOL. What?   They were nice enough to comp that dish, but again, the owner/manager/whoever never came by to talk to us about it, apologize, ask how everything else was, nothing.... On our way out we walked past the table the owner was sitting at... he said \"sorry about that, have a good one.\" LOL  Never again"

                "description": "\"delusions of grandeur\" is the title of my review. Do NOT go here! Here are the reasons why...  1) There was a $100 steak on the menu and plastic picnic tables to sit on outside.  2) Service was slow with minimal customer. There was an item requested (pirouline) that was never delivered by the wait staff.  3) The kids cheeseburger was the same size as the adult cheeseburger.  4) They provided a \"side salad\" composed of iceberg lettuce.  5) The \"vegetables\" provided on the steak (of which you no explanation was provided on the menu as to identify the cut of meat other than noting that it was an \"angus steak\") were RAW and by my count our table (of which THREE of these dishes were ordered) had 1.5 baby's carrots on average on each plate. When I asked the waitress for more carrots... it took her 20min to let me know that the chef said it would require the chef SO much work to blanch the carrots... At this point my steak was pretty much done and I informed her we would simply NEVER RETURN.  6) The menu was limited.  We will never go back."

                "description": "If you're looking for fine dining , a place to celebrate something special, or just want fantastic food and feel extra special them look no further than Mako's!  We celebrated our anniversary and wanted to experience a place we hadn't been to.  Walking in we were immediately seated.  Wait staff was jovial and attentive.   Our appetizers were very good and filling (we should have only ordered one but couldn't decide between the two) fried Brussels and Levantine trio. Our entrees were equally difficult to choose but ultimately my husband ordered the 1855 beef coulotte, medium rare.  It was cooked exactly how he wanted with red on the center and juices running in every bite.  You could even taste the hint of coffee spice.  The turnips and carrots were prepared in a Marchand de vin sauce, complimented it nicely.  My entree was the chickpea crusted salmon.  I loved every bite!  It had a slight char on the outside but very moist on the inside.  The tomato and eggplant stew it came with also delicious.   Easily a five star restaurant that I'd recommend and plan on returning to."

                "description": "We found this new trendy spot in Cibolo, Texas. The host was very accommodating when we arrived, if you wanted to wear a mask then they wore mask and if you were comfortable and not wearing a mask then they would not wear a mask.  He sat us all down as we were still waiting for three people from our party. Once our full party had arrived, we had to wait. Unfortunately the waitress took over 10 minutes to come to our table to at least offer some water.  Overall our experience was very great! Unfortunately I did not take a lot of pictures because it was my sisters birthday. But I did manage to sneak in a picture of my cheeseburger which was very light. And I don't mean light in a bad way I mean it as in a satisfying way. Must try!   Their cocktails are also very delicious. I had the cucumber margarita cocktail if I'm not mistaken, and it was very light and subtle at the same time. But boozy!   The only part that I was not super happy with was that the waitress mentioned to us that she had ordered a special surprise for my sister which was their almond cake. As a gift from her. So to me that means that the dessert is on them. But surprisingly when I received the ticket the almond cake was on there. I did not feel like I really wanted to argue over the almond cake but as I stated the way she mentioned it to me is that she was covering the cake. So for that reason I did remove one star.  Something that I really liked about this place was the bathroom. As a first time Mama i've noticed that many restaurants don't have a baby changing table. Or if they have a baby changing table it's very dirty. This place had a very awesome baby changing station. They had diapers, they had wipes, they had waste bags. You think of it and they had it!  Thanks To their management for this!   Great place to eat! Enjoy!"

                "description": "Mako's is a really nice restaurant! The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was nicely decorated and had great ambiance. The food and drinks we ordered were delicious. One of the previous reviews mentioned the Aunt Bees Knees being delicious so I decided to try it and it was really good. My wife got the salmon and I ordered the Pork Shoulder. The salmon was delicious (probably not worth $30 but it did taste very good) and the pork shoulder was also very good as well. One thing I will caution in regards to the pork shoulder is that it is very fatty. There was a lot of fat on the sides of the lean pork that added flavor for sure but wasn't very healthy. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were delicious. A lot of good flavor.   We enjoyed our time at Mako especially since the staff was so nice. However, the price was really not worth it. I'm going to give it 5 stars bc there isn't a 4.5 star option and the experience was worth more than a 4 but I don't think I'd be coming back mainly because of the price of the food. It was good though; so if you don't mind paying extra then this is a good spot for date night or to enjoy a nice evening dinner.   Overall: 4.5 stars"

The servers were on top of it as we were changing seats, walking around, it was definitely professional.  The booking and reserving was so easy too.  Everyone enjoyed their food, my paella was awesome. I also tried their steak and their fried chicken...I would order it all if I could afford it. There is no competition with flavor and quality of their ingredients.  I thank the restaurant and we all enjoyed our time."

                "description": "A three star review is not a bad review, it means it's okay.  This is definitely a nice restaurant and addition to Cibolo.    The customer service was excellent.  Their outdoor seating and live music makes this a great choice for a date night or night out with friends.  The owner met us at the door on our way out to get feedback of our experience.    This could be because of COVID-19 but the seating outdoors consisted mostly of picnic style benches which is not my preference.  It is nice to be able to lean back in your chair, relax and enjoy the environment and live music.    I ordered their steak and it was not what I was expecting, especially for the price.  My steak came already cut and very lightly seasoned.  I did not like it.  I saw pictures on Yelp reviews of their Tomahawk steak and that is what I was expecting.  We did enjoy their wine and craft beer selection.    I might give this another try once restrictions are lifted and will update this review.  But for now it's a 3/5.  Would I recommend it yes but would I rave about it? No."

First and foremost, let's talk about the food, it is phenomenal! Chef Kyronn Cordner knows his stuff. We started with salads...my Greek salad was prepared so beautifully and the ingredients handled so delicately, it was a perfect blend of fresh and tasty, and I couldn't eat it fast enough. The wedge salad was inspiring with its blend of ingredients with a perfect combination of savory my husband absolutely loved. For entrees we had the Easter Special of Salmon over eggplant and tomato moussaka and the 44 farms Tri-tip spiced by Ky. Each dish was a perfect blend of flavors and textures. The food here was truly some of the best we have ever been served and all in our backyard of Cibolo!  Let's talk service!   Paul was our server and we were smitten upon meeting him, he took care of us and was on top of our needs the entire night. We were lucky to meet one of the owners, Jackie Peterson. She was delightful and truly grateful for our feedback and patronage. She told us all about her family's journey through the Airforce and settling here, as well as the local resources they use for the food they serve in the restaurant.   We are delighted to have found such a culinary gem in the heart of Cibolo and will be returning very soon!"

                "description": "Industry leading!  Well I was finally able to get to San Marcos and got to walk around the square. In doing so I found several bars and coffee shops which was great! The bars were still pretty empty being that it was only 3pm and I needed human interaction! That was when I found Industry. It's no secret that Industry is great, based on their reviews and I was happy to have found it to be so close. For me, there were 3 things that really separated Industry. The first being my bartender, Madison. She did an outstanding job making sure I felt welcomed and was quick to present water in which I especially appreciated given the heat. She knew the beer menu and gave me a few recommendations, eventually nailing it with a beer called Easy Rider. I recommend it if you're into a craft blonde ale. I also ordered a dirty martini  and ask her if she would make it the way she usually does, which turned out great. She used Botanist Gin which was perfecto with just the right amount of floral. Thanks Madison for the solid recommendations and the hospitality. Very much obliged. I ordered the Brussel sprouts, of course, which were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful (light) mustard finish. My only complaint was the size of the sprouts, not to be confused with the portion size, which was more than enough for one person. I just figured it had something to do with the season and happily ate up. I was 3 for 3 and couldn't have left happier.  Industry is a really cool, upbeat spot and I will most definitely be back when I get the chance. They are dog friendly, too, with water bowls and treats in the patio area.   Highly recommend!!  Sincerely,  MLA"

                "description": "TLDR a-ok to I'm a fan despite some bumps  My first time ordering for pickup. Everything was delicious, it was ready at the time promised. The big flaw was I didn't get the beer battered squash I ordered and paid for, but as Mr R didn't check the bag before leaving we cannot lay that all on them. It was a very busy night and mistakes happen.  The other error was I didn't get the 30% off to-go booze still advertised on their online menu which is why this isn't 5*  Mr R is besotted with their black bean veggie burger. I think there must be spice in the patty as none of the other listed ingredients explain its lovely low heat. He also likes the texture of the bean patty, he wanted me to mention that.  The salmon burger was good, huge, nice fresh veg, I love the spice in the aioli and poblano ranch, but I REALLY wish they still did the smoked salmon bagel I had one brunch there long ago.  The farm beet salad? Gorgeous. Mr R gleefully ate most of it on his own and he often eats salads with a sense of duty rather than joy. I loved the white balsamic vinaigrette it came with, I'm going to need that more often in my life.  The drinks to go? Hooray! One note, bring your own standard brown pulp drink tray if you think you'll need one because they didn't provide one. The pours were fabulous on our mimosas, The Closer and White Box. Ice was the perfect amount.  The transaction could have gone smoother, but the meal went down great. This remains a place Mr R wants to go *every* time he's in town."

                "description": "This must be a very popular place. Came in for Sunday brunch and it was packed! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The $11  mimosa carafe special immediately got my attention. I knew I had to have that. Found us a booth on the left corner by the bar. Ordered the mimosa, 2 industry burgers, Parmesan fries and the tater tot casserole. The mimosa was disappointingly room temperature. The burgers were bordering on salty but were good. We especially liked the chips and salsa that came with it. The fries were good but a little expensive for what you get. The tater tot casserole , we didn't like at all. Very salty and the hot sauce did not go with the dish at all. Don't think we'll come back."

Saturday lunch where we literally waited over an hour from ordering food to food on our table and the food I got not only had a sticker on the fries, but the BBQ sandwich was dry and inedible. I've now been here twice and never been happy with the food. I won't be back."

                "description": "There were mixed reviews...the adults loved their food! We had the CFC w queso - gave it two thumbs up!! We also had the chicken tacos and the person who had those raves about how good they were! We also had the queso, salsa, fried squash, loaded fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizer and all were a huge hit!! Most of the teenagers had the burgers and did not like them. They said they tasted like sausage. I think the issue is the burgers were very, very lean and smoked so they were a little dry.  The BIGGEST COMPLAINT were the flies...OMG!!! So freaking annoying to have to constantly be waving your hand back and forth so a darn fly does not land on your food!! Do something about that bc we would never come back solely for that purpose!"

Brunch is amazing, honestly i feel that no matter what you get you cant go wrong. I LOVE their Parmesan fries and their CFC with queso. Those boozy milkshakes are small but yes, boozy such as the rest of their alcoholic beverages. The industry burger and brisket tacos are also so amazing."

Masks are being worn by staff and limited capacity allows for social distancing.  There is patio dining however being right off the street with cars passing by frequently Tonight's food was good..Delicious smoked chicken thigh then fried much like a chicken fried chicken..Boy that smoke came through so well. Not a gargantuan serving like a chicken breast but nonetheless yummy.  The Reuben was great-toasty and melty...love Kraut so I would've doubled up. Cool college vibes and can see how this place might pack it in easily on any night of the week"

                "description": "My first time here and I love it! The food was delicious and reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I definitely had left overs. My favorite was definitely the sweet benny and chili cheese fries. I'm not usually a chili cheese fry fan but this chili is legitimately so delicious with chunks of brisket in it! The biscuit and jam combo is delcious but it was definitely more suited for 3 to 4 people instead of 2 with other dishes ordered. In hindsight, ordering 2 types of fried potatoes was probably over kill but still delicious none the less. I didn't try the half off mimosas but for sure next time, I'll definitely be getting a cocktail to try!   The staff was super friendly and great at getting our food out in a timely manner. The vibe out there was perfect and a lot of fun with the live music!  They seemed very on top of the cleaning and everyone wore masks when standing."

Also, since we sat at the bar, we watched Tiffany in full \"go-time\" mode.  She was professional and personable; making it look easy to provide drinks for a whole bar/restaurant single-handedly.  Although the process was apparently moving slower than normal, the interactions with her made it much more tolerable and it was a lot of fun talking to her.  We will definitely return."

I had the Porky's Pancakes and my husband ordered the Buttermilk Biscuits and Gravy. The Porky's was good, but they don't allow you to customize and it was too much pulled pork. Next time, I'll just order the side pancakes. My husband said his biscuits and gravy were good, but very dry and not enough gravy. I also had the cold brew coffee, which was quite weak. The service was prompt, except that we never received one of our side orders and it took 3 servers to correct the error."

Friendly, and more importantly, knowledgeable tap masters that can match your beer tastes to the selections on tap.   You can order a pitcher of beer at this place!  I don't see this in many growler stations.  All in all, it's a very fun place.  The staff and the customers are very chill and down to earth.  It's in a strip center at the corner of LBJ and East Sessom Dr.  The address is listed on LBJ and while you can enter there, it's a lot easier if you enter from East Sesson Drive.  And there's a LOT more parking on this side."

For a place as small and intimate as it is, there's a lot of seating packed in it and even some outdoor seating. There's games, lots of games. Card games, board games, darts, pool, and sometimes even a live DJ.  If you dig the craft brew scene this place is surely right up your alley. If you find yourself in San Marcos come check em out!"

They have all Texas craft beers, 28 on tap, fresh, and they even have a few selections in cans and some wine!      I was shocked when I saw they had The Infinite Monkey Theorem Rose' ....impressive.   The vibe is awesome. Super laid back, chill, artsy, and hipster. Loves it.       The owners are lovely people. So nice, great service, and very informative on every single beer. They make it their priority to get the perfect beer for you.   They have some savory oyster crackers for you to enjoy while you booze it up. Cards Against Humanity is also available to play for free!        The decor was my favorite. I was super into the refurbished wooden pallets, the art work, the baby succulents, and the colors!   Will definitely be returning many more evenings."

With that being said, I've been to growler places in the greater Austin area and IMHO, I think The Growling is better than most of them.  As previously mentioned, there are 28 beers on tap, all Texas-made stuff, but unlike other growler places I've been to they have a bar and you can drink a pint, invite friends, and just hang out. The owners are super friendly and work hard to set you up with the perfect craft beer experience! They even have a stage setup for live music and get live acts mostly on the weekend.  Also, as previously mentioned, there is no kitchen but they allow outside food and with Pie Society, Bobcat nation, Dos Gatos, Mocas/Javas, Rose Garden (Chinese), and Thai Thai in close proximity; you won't have to go far to fight off those hunger cravings! They haven't been open very long (less than 2 months) so they're off to a slow start but hopefully as word gets out they'll start getting busier and maybe even expand on what's an already great start! If you're in San Marcos for the River, the Square, the Hill Country, or in school looking to skip class, The Growling is every bit worth checking out!"

Whiskey Business has a diverse, quality, well-priced inventory. They had everything I needed. Even took home a six of Boerne Brewery's Old Courthouse Ale at the owner's suggestion. It's like he knew what I'd like. He did. One of my favorites is an Irish dry stout {think Guinness}, and I've now found a new favorite. Love it! I'll make Whiskey Business my go-to. Thank you for your hospitality!"

                "description": "When you hear the word BUS one would normally think about a city bus or there like. This is not the case for the Crafty Thirst Beer Bus, no it's a VW van that is being used to serve beer. We were passing by and noticed a sign that said Grand Opening. We stopped to check out this Grand Opening. We were approached by this creepy guy smoking a cigarette as he said do you have ID, we showed our drivers licenses and instead of saying thank you, have a nice day anything he just stared at us. We were reading the list of beers that were offered. It was a little confusing as there was no direction on what the beers were are how much they were. We decided to order at the VW \"BUS\". We were asking what different types of beers were available and how much they were. The guy that was helping us (later found out was the one of the owners) passed us to someone else. We thought that was rude but the lady that served us made up for it. The beers were $7.00 dollars for a 9 ounce or you could get 4 -  7 ounces for $10.00 dollars to me that is extremely high. Most of the places in Canyon Lake have beers for $2.50. The beer we had, had more of a foam head on it and we were not offered to top it off. Another guy was serving mixed drinks one with Pecan Rum. The mixed drinks were $7.00 dollars, high for the area and the amount you get. I will confess that the rum was one of the best I have had. A few times I heard other people saying that the price's were too high. If you can get a beer for $2.50 then why would someone pay $7.00 dollars. The band was the only entertainment and they were amazing. There was suppose to be a raffle for the VW BUS but when I asked about it I was told that it was not going to take place. This was troubling being that I was told by the owner that it was the main giveaway."

The establishment is adorable - informal seating inside and out.   I first got some pappadum and a few chutneys-tamarind and mint. They were spicy! Caught me off guard but delicious for sure.    My mom ordered the Curry Trio with chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, and saag paneer. I ordered  a beef kabob curry taco. Every bite of every dish was delicious. While I loved my taco, I highly recommend the Curry Trio because you get a great choice.   When we first got there, I was like meh. Only a few tables were seated outside and the inside was empty. But right after we ordered, the place quickly filled up! Wow.   The service was superb. I couldn't have asked for a better server. I'll definitely be back!"

I got the vegetable samosas, and the samosas were nearly perfect, with the potato and pea filling having just the right level of seasoning. They came with beautiful mango chutney whose chunks were visible and a lovely green chutney. Both were so delicious I was hard put to decide which I wanted to put on each of the three samosas.  For drinks I had two of the Wasatch Polygamy (a nitro porter), and it was fantastic. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't as overwhelming as a milk stout, but also the delicious flavor of a porter.  The patio dining was great, with plenty of shade.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was... slow, with respect to both drinks and food. Otherwise, the whole thing was outstanding."

We sat inside it's smaller but very cozy. They have a bar with many draft beers, wine and specialty drinks.  We started with the vegetable samosas and it came with side of mint sauce and mango chutney that was so tasty. Both complimented the samosas in a wonderful way. The flavors were amazing.  I ordered the tiki masala taco that was filled with so much flavor and very filling.       A must try!! And hubby had the trio which he choose tiki masala, curry chicken and butter chicken along with coconut rice. All three were fantastic.  Service was good and food was fantastic and very reasonably priced.  I'm excited to come back and try something new on the menu and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Street!! #supportsmallbusiness"

Went to lunch with coworkers on the first day of fall, so we got a table outdoors, never stepped foot inside. Service was slow, but it seemed it was only one waiter, so no points taken away for that.  Server was detailed in explaining what everything was and the level of spice and comfort. We had one vegan and one spice sensitive guest in our group, so he pointed out what would be best for the group to order. I ordered chicken nachos, and paneer tacos, wanting spice and meat. Other guests ordered samosas with mango chutney, vegan nachos, and spinach paneer. It was filling enough with a beautiful presentation! The jalapeno cream mixed with tamarind on the tacos mixed perfectly with the Indian spices.  The curry on the shredded chicken and tortilla chips (couldn't tell if they were made in house or store bought) had me trying not to lock the bowl. Will definitely go back to try more items on the menu!"

But seriously, if you're not already in San Marcos, come here. And eat this. It's that good. If you think you're a foodie and haven't tried this, fix that. So incredibly good. And for $9 per taco that's basically a meal and a party in your mouth, it doesn't exactly set you back much. They have a great beer selection too and cool ambiance and attentive service. But the tacos are the draw. Come here. Eat the Indian style tacos. 5 stars."

I was able to get some lavender cider since it was pretty early in the day, but the porter and stout options were very tempting (some at over 12% alcohol).  The dogs were with us so we settled outside in their spacious yard that has a lot of shade and a fan blowing.  We ordered curry fries as an appetizer and they were wedged exactly like chic fil a fries seasoned in a curry mix powder.  These were good, but can do with a pinch of sugar and lots of extra spice.  I had the chicken Tikka masala plate and my husband got the chicken 65 taco.  The taco looked more like a wrap and wasn't as filling as what he expected, but tasted pretty good.  Fried chicken seasoned in sauce inside the taco had a good kick to it.  My chicken Tikka masala plate was delicious, but a little extra spice would help.  Also, I think the restaurant can do better by adding naan! Great concept to check out!"

They seemed to have attitudes of a bar that is not in a college town but a boujee downtown bar. The bartender who was close to my age charged me for regular priced drinks when we ordered 2/3 of our drinks in the happy hour range. When I came to close out and order our (3rd) last drink. The bartender said \"do you mind if I close you out?\" I thought this was very odd as it was a Wednesday evening and I was purchasing not only alcohol but food. I do believe they have an amazing food truck that supplies great food. I am sure this was a one time fluke as the rest of the experience was great. I do stand by my opinion that the staff maybe biased to certain crowds so be weary."

We found it while looking at houses in the neighborhood surrounding the bar. The staff was kind and courteous and the misters and fans were a nice cooling off touch with the Texas heat."

Not a huge selection on tap but we love what they do have and will be going a couple times a month now that we have found it.  Side note, their cobbler is the ish. They make it to order so it's so fresh and hot."

                "description": "A must visit bar and restaurant in downtown New Braunfels. The Phoenix Saloon has a rich history being registered as a Texas Landmark as well as being on a tour of haunted places! They've kept up that 1800's saloon feel, very cool!  That aside, their menu is delicious. Top shelf \"bar food\". But the must have is their homemade chili and cornbread. It's to freaking die for! But be warned, it comes in three levels of heat. The hottest would tear up the toughest of Texas cowpokes! They also have a full bar with a multitude of craft and domestic beers on draught.  The Phoenix is also well known for their showcase of local music talent. From a laidback guy strumming a guitar on the small stage during the afternoon, to full on rock and country bands on the big stage at night on the weekend. That said, the ONLY drawback is the music (during the afternoon) can be too loud at times. Still, add the Phoenix Saloon to your list to visit (or comeback for another visit!) you won't be disappointed."

                "description": "I never give any food/drink place five stars regardless of how good they are.  Also, four stars because it's a little dark in there.  Otherwise a great place to go and be seen without getting talked about, unlike at The Faust.  Nice to visit during the day for lunch and a beverage.  Definitely has a nighttime music vibe.  Very loud, be warned, but you can take your drink outside and sit on the patio and people watch.  I'm not a beer drinker, but I'll order a screwdriver.  I go so rarely and am always amazed that the barkeep knows what I drink!  I'll grab a stool and she'll ask if I want \"the usual.\"  Uncanny!  They could add some modern conveniences like purse hooks by the bar stools, but it's no big deal for me.  It actually keeps me from forgetting my purse if it perches on the bar counter.  I love this place so much that I have the urge to go tomorrow!"

We filled up the place - what a fun and neat venue! A cover band was playing, they were lots of fun and even inspired us old folks to get up and dance! They treated us well, took great care of us, and it made for a really fun evening.  Next trip down we plan to stop in and try some of the food that we heard was great!!

                "description": "The Phoenix Saloon is conveniently located just off the main square on the corner of  San Antonio and Casteel with huge windows to look out to the street. I've been here several times over the years since they have opened. It's always a stop on the pub crawls!   What's not to love...  Long bar along the way for all those bar flies to hold up Lots of seating which is also great for groups Huge band stand for those night with live music Food!... how about that history of chili???  The history according to their website: \"Since 1871, our building has been home to various bars and saloons, most famously the original Phoenix Saloon. It was here in 1894 that William Gebhardt, proprietor of the back room cafe, invented chili powder! Prior to this, chilis had only ever been used fresh, but Gebhardt devised a process for crushing and drying them. Gebhardt brand chili products are still widely available today. The original Phoenix Saloon was reputedly the first bar in Texas to offer service to women. No lady who valued her reputation would dare be seen in a saloon, so the proprietor set up a ladies beer garden with bells in the trees for service. There was a deer pen too, and an alligator pit and badger fights. There was even a parrot on a perch just inside the front door that was taught to say, \"Have you paid your bill!?\" in German! Prohibition put an end to the good times at the Phoenix, which closed its doors on June 26, 1918. The Ludwig Building, as it was then known, was expanded and turned into a department store in 1922. In 1935, by now renamed the Schmidt Building, it was remodeled again. The building was home to a number of retail and service businesses until the Phoenix rose from the ashes, so to speak, on March 5, 2010. Like its mythical namesake, the Phoenix Saloon has been reborn! The new owners relish the building's flavorful past. In bringing the new incarnation to life, they've exposed the original 1871 brick wall, salvaged the old Phoenix Saloon beadboard paneling and re-used various old shutters, sinks and lights. Trying to celebrate all aspects of the building, they also constructed the 40-foot-long bar from the old department store cabinetry, flipped a mirror from the old shoe department upside down behind the bar and relocated a three-way dressing room mirror in the ladies restroom.\"  The Phoenix is also to be reported as being haunted... with such history, this shouldn't be a surprise.... Boo!   So go grab a local beer and some Texas Red with Fritos and a burger on the side... it's time to have a good 'ol time in downtown NB!"

All the tables rest of the tables were labeled with a reserved sign for 7:30.  We were not acknowledged or offered any explanation why there was no seating available.  We felt as if the employees were staring at us waiting for us to leave. And that's what we did.  We walked across the street to KRAUSE's where we were welcomed."

You can even park on the street for free.  The tables were dirty, so we brushed it off with a napkin. I had to fight the flies during the entire meal.  You can't order at the table. You can see the lady behind the bar. You order at the bar, then go sit at a table.  Our food came. My burger was on a cold, stale bun. The burger was ordered well done, but it came medium well.  The fries were cold. My wife's burger was the same. Her fries were the same.  Sad, because this place could be so much more."

                "description": "Came for the chili and history.  They have 4 heat level chilis. They all start from the same base chili and then peppers are added ranging from jalepenos to ghost chilis. I stopped at habanero. Not blazing but good heat.  The toppings are pricy at $0.75 each for small amounts of onion, cheese, sour cream, etc. it adds up quickly.  The chili flavor is tasty. Large chunks or as they say hunks of browned sirloin (seemed like chuck) are widely dispersed in a thickened chili sauce. I prefer 80% meat with just enough reduced chili stock, theirs is more like 50:50.  Moved on to the blue burger. Menu says stuffed with blue cheese but it is actually mixed in the meat. It was well prepared and tasty.  The atmosphere is super chill and the Night Owls were on stage tonight, I'm impressed! Service is mostly order at the bar.  I'm pretty much a chili snob, I only like my own creation but theirs is pretty good if someone else is making it for you."

I really get it, but if an establishment is going to serve food it might be a good idea to have food servers. Our nephew brought us here for the chili.  If you are hungry for chili this is the place. The chili coke rated in degrees of heat. I understand the draw for the chili. The burger, sandwiches and other items are just standard nothing special. People have to go to the bar to order food and to get drinks. There is no table served except to bring food from the kitchen and someone cleans off the table when people leave.  The live music was....just background noise. I guess it was just open mic night or something. Great selection of beer on tap. Three solid bartenders who seemed to keep the place going. If you are out to drink beer on tap and maybe grab a bite this is okay.  Chili is good."

When we arrived the blonde bartender was assisting another customer for a hot 5 minutes. When she came over to us we asked to order food and she said the kitchen closed ONE MINUTE BEFORE. But ma'am, we have been standing here for a while... If someone took our order when we arrived, we wouldn't've been in this pickle. The place was not busy (2-3 3 tops max). I understand the kitchen is closed but I'm sure, positive even, that they don't throw out the chili as soon as the second hand hits 12. You could've asked the kitchen to scoop one bowl of chili out in exchange for money, and I bet $100 they would've done it. Why? Because I ask my kitchen guys all the time.   We will not be coming back and my boyfriend would like to speak to management/owners. Thanks."

I chose the pear and bacon pizza, which was delicious. my husband had a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a sangria flight, which was quite nice.

There is overflow parking across the street, appropriately signed as extra parking for Patio Dolcetto.  Someone put a lot of effort and love into designing the space.   Alex the bartender was very friendly and our group had good conversation with him.   They have a Sunday Special right now: a bottle of wine (5 options) and a cheese board for $25. The cheese board had water crackers, Marcona almonds, dried apricots, craisins (?), jam, Olive tapenade, a smoked Gouda, a cheddar - almost like TJs unexpected cheddar, but more firm and reminiscent of Parmesan (not crumbly like UC), and a chèvre (I think). All very tasty.   We did the special twice. The White Zin was given to us on accident (instead of the merlot we requested) but they're very low key and friendly and we try to be easy going (especially about wine!) so we enjoyed the Zin.   I look forward to checking out other specials and enjoying the nice atmosphere outside when it gets a little cooler."

                "description": "I stopped here with a friend on our drive from Austin to San Antonio and will definitely be making the trip back to San Marcos to visit again! I ordered the white sangria, which fair warning was very sweet but it was still delicious. The menu said the white sangria had ginger in it, although I didn't taste that specific ingredient I was hoping for, it was still a good choice. They do wine flights as well, and have a pretty good happy hour.  We ordered a cheese board and sat at the bar. The cheese board was generous and filling, the service was great, and the atmosphere was on point. It is a casual wine bar, and they had live music outside which would have been nice to watch aside from the cold weather. They have a lot of seating outside, and a good amount of community seating inside.  Overall, great experience here and will be hopefully going back!"

That being said, we all got burgers so I feel like it could have been faster? The food hit the spot after a day on the river but just to get the waiters attention was hard work as they only had 4 people on duty. Then to pay the check again it was another long wait. I can't recommend this place if you're hungry, but if you have the time, sure you should go. Prices were reasonable."

Their menu is very over priced and boy do they love their micro-transactions or add-ons.  Fries are extra with their expensive and average burgers. BACON is like $2 extra.  They charge you for using a credit card and so much more.   Their queso is Velveeta and rotel and not even that good. Most of their chips they serve with the queso is tiny broken scraps and they get annoyed if you ask for more.   The staff is either uncaring or over-worked. I have had many incidences where I am eating solo and am ignored in getting service initially and after.  This is most likely because the server is more interested in dealing with the beer drinking frat guys. Almost every time I have been there I have been left without a basic refill of water. Many times i have also sat waiting for my food with no sight of my server.   The only saving grace of this place is the half price wings on Wednesday, but even then I would get them to go."

Place was not that crowded (in the front) and the tables were spaced out.  View was nice to enjoy those strolling by  the sidewalk.  The sign at the front said $3.50 bloody mary's, so I ordered one and it was the bomb (see pic).  Perfect drink that had all the fixin's.  The Chicken and Waffle Bites caught my attention, so I ordered that to hold us over.  These were really good and worth the appetizer! The reason for 2 stars knocked off were the service that was absent throughout our time here.  He disappeared all the time and couldn't find him once my sister and niece showed up.  This service made me decide to go somewhere else for lunch.  The other star was due to being charged full-price for the 2 bloody mary's.  I didn't say anything, as I wasn't sure when the waiter would come back and also felt small businesses need any extra cash during these times.  I still tipped the waiter, since they need money too but not sure how he was so busy with a light audience in the place."

They are my go to burger when I get a burger craving. However, I have heard that all their other specialty burgers are amazing as well.   My one complaint is the service. It's mainly a bar, it's going to be busy- I get it. I've worked the industry. But every time I've gone, something is wrong with my order, I'm double charged on something, or the waitress hardly ever comes to check on us.   I'll keep coming for the amazing burgers- and they deserve the stars, but the service needs some improvement."

They refused to serve me and I refused to stay quiet. I escalated to the owner after his employees all worked together to ensure that customer service is not important to them at all. I spend a lot of money eating out especially to try new things and I support local businesses. But I couldn't try their food because they don't accommodate properly to accept mastercard payment on a to go order (which they now claim they do allow). Hope you all decide to go somewhere else that values you as a customer. Support black owned businesses.  I hope the COVID hits them hard in the pockets."

Awesome atmosphere, lots of TVs to see the games, great cold drinks and yes kid friendly but if you have little little ones, may want to take something for them to do.  The wings are awesome!  Place is loud but that's what your there for!  Great food, clean restaurant and good service."

                "description": "Now I know this is a chain place, but the wings deserve to be talked about. They are crispy, the meet inside is moist, and the sauces are flavorful.  If you live in the area and work from home, this is a must for Favor. It's often available quickly without a delivery fee.   The fries are very tasty. They have a good selection of on tap beers and the wait staff is friendly.   Prices are fair, you get a good amount of food for what you pay.   Where this place falls short of a Five star (well four star) are the other menu items quality. Wings are good, but the other menu items are nothing to be excited about. They'll do if you're hungry, but not if want flavor beyond bland."

                "description": "After getting over the $67 bill for myself and my three boys, I realized that we did have a good meal. We ordered fried cheese  balls that were delicious. Two of the three boys ordered wings and fries, and cleaned their plates. My youngest ordered chicken tenders from the kid's menu and they were huge; he was only able to eat one before he was satisfied. I had the pecan chicken salad with a blueberry pomegranate vinaigrette. The salad was basic, but a solid choice. The dressing wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped for, but fortunately the chicken and the candied pecans were good enough to carry the salad. I also ordered a pina colada at the advising of the young waitress; I won't do that again.  Overall, it was a good, and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  Whether we return or not will depend on the boys suggesting it again for our Friday night outings."

                "description": "I've been coming here for a few years now.  Usually the food is very good and service is great.  This night must have been a one off.  We had a to-go order of Buffalo-medium, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan wings with extra celery and carrot sticks.  After getting home we saw there was almost no sauce on the Buffalo and Garlic Parmesan which led to almost no flavor.  The veggie sticks were browned old and probably should have been thrown out.  Why would you send out brown/old veggie sticks?  I would rather you tell me you're out than get something that looked like that.  They usually do better than this and they can do better than this.  Quality control was not very effective tonight.  Hopefully, it will be better next time."

                "description": "We decided to go to Anchor Bar after seeing it on Texas Eats.  We've been there a few times since then, and we absolutely love their wings.  They've got quite a variety of sauces, and we have tried the mango habanero, spicy garlic parmesan, honey siracha, honey bourbon bbq, and the extreme.  They were all really good,  but the spicy garlic parmesan and honey siracha are our absolute favorite.  The spicy garlic parmesan has a light hint of spice to it with a nice garlic parmesan kick.  The honey siracha is sweet with a light kick of spice at the end.  I personally like the honey siracha the best out of both of the sauces.  It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.    We also get the mac and cheese balls appetizer, which is fried macaroni and cheese served with a side of ranch and a side of honey siracha sauce.  They pair very well with the wings we get.    If you enjoy wings, I highly recommend Anchor Bar."

We started out with a bowl of white queso and it took forever, so it was on the house, which was nice.   I decided on the chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potato fries (they charge you more for these), my sisters split a large pizza and our friend, Frank, got one as well.   My salad was delightful and the pizzas were given two thumbs up by both parties.   Service has been great, but it's pretty empty.   Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Pretty standard bar bites across the board. We had wings, a burger, macaroni, and loaded fries along with a couple brews. It wasn't packed for a Saturday afternoon but they did seat us back to back with other tables before capacity was supposed to be opened up to 100% so that was a bummer.   Our server sort of left us to it. Didn't relay any info regarding happy hour or food recommendations despite noting it was our first visit. Every time we looked up he was across the restaurant working on something else until a larger party was placed in his area, then his focus swung to them.  Nothing really stood out, food-wise. If you want something crunchy and you're already in the area, maybe swing through, but I won't be going out of my way."

                "description": "Sad that I did not enjoy Anchor Bar.  I will say, I read some reviews about them not adhering to Covid guidelines, and they must have changed since then. They did temperature checks for all guests, tables were very spread out and masks required! Some of the best I have seen at a restaurant the past year.  Some positives: the music playlist was the bomb, really loved that. The boneless wings on my meal were good, and I would return for that! My husband got the Buffalo chicken wrap, which he said we alright, but he would try something else if we went again.  Some not positives: I love Mac and cheese and was not a fan of theres at all, just not my type. I also got the queso and chips, and I think it should've been hotter, because it was already thick (not runny) by the time it was brought to our table (I would give this another chance if I knew the cheese would be dippable, because the flavor was good, just hard to eat)  Overall, we might go back and give it one more chance!"

We've had the classic and boneless wings and the flavoring has been really good.  Not overly salty or intense, but rather just right. The biggest problem is that on two occasions our wings were cold by the time they reached our table.  I thought the first time was an anomaly, but twice in a row makes me think the kitchen is cooking up a huge batch of wings and trying to keep them warm until they are ordered.  The last time we even asked for our wings well done in hopes that they would come out hot, but they did not.  And to make things worse our fries were cold as well, but our server kindly exchanged them for a fresh batch.  Hopefully they can sort these problems out because the wings are tasty and the service is good."

                "description": "This brewery was on my list of places to check out on my next trip to Texas. I was able to check it off my list during my latest visit.  There is a lot of outdoor space, my preference on a sunny TX day but it was a bit chilly when I  stopped by so I sat inside.  The decor has a modern farmhouse look with long tables for large groups or beerhall seating in the center, bistro height tables for mid-size groups on one side and cozy tables for 2 by the stainless fermenting tanks.  You order your beer at the counter near the taps and pick up food near the back. Easy! The staff was friendly and welcoming. Everyone working appeared happy to be there. I ordered an IPA and the pretzel. The beer selection isn't extensive but covers a range of types so finding a beer is not an issue. I enjoyed my IPA, an American IPA-the Brew-S-A. The pretzel came with 3 sauces, a mustard, cheese and caramel-this was different but delicious. The food menu is similar to the beer menu, not big but will have something for most. I'd like to come back for lunch next time I'm in town so I can try an entree. I had a great visit to Gather and will be back. It's low key and casual with great food, beer and smiling faces behind the counter.  The street the brewery sits on is under currently under construction but it's an easy detour and worth the extra few minutes drive."

The place is clean, plenty of room to sit, indoors and outdoors. The staff is friendly and helpful.    We are always looking for a good place to come hang out and be social. Good place to bring the kids, they have an area for the kiddos. Very kid friendly.     There were four of us, so we started with a hot chocolate, with marshmallows     I got the noble wheat, has a great taste, but it is missing an orange slice. Still great tasting beer.     Also had the trilogy, which is a Belgian triple ale style beer. Has a great smell, and a great tasting beer.     Had the cold front quad, omg, wonderful smell and great taste. Highly recommend this one.    Next one was the morning glory, a coffee porter, smelled is great, the taste is good, not too heavy on the coffee, which is good.   The last beer we had was the \"takes two to tango\", an ipa, not a fan of too many ipa's, but this one for me is very drinkable.    Also tried the pretzel, with the spicy mustard, the whiskey caramel, and beer cheese dips. This pretzel comes from Uwe's bakery in New Braunfels. Great pretzel."

                "description": "I really wanted to like this place.  The decor was contemporary and the place itself seemed to have a nice vibe.  It's close by and the only brewery within a 10  mile radius.   Service was inconsistent.  There seems to be miscommunication between the people behind the bar and the waitstaff. One said we could only order at the bar and another said they could take our orders. Who knows, either way, we had to be constantly reminding them of what we'd ordered, or bringing us basic items like water, silverware, and our check. They're not as attentive but we felt that having 2 people might have been overwhelming for the inside of the place. Let me say I'm not much of a beer drinker.  I tend to stay with pale ale and ciders.  My husband on the other hand, loves stouts, lagers, and other types.  This was a soft opening and we were told limited types of beer were available.  Of the 5 that were available, he liked 2.  They offer 2 wines (cab and zin).  Stay with the cab.   They also offer food.  It was a hit or miss on what was served.  The Korean brisket tacos tasted like 2 separate items.  The little bit of \"Korean\" slaw on it was ok, not much flavor but at least refreshing.  The brisket was dry, hard, and tasted like nothing.  It was served with rice, let me rephrase- soy sauce and some rice.  I eat and make rice frequently,  I took one bite and pushed it aside. It was soy sauce with rice, no other flavors came through.  The pulled pork bites were \"eh\". My husband ordered a chicken burger.  That was tender and flavorful.  The Korean wings were good.  I'd order that again.  We will give this place another try but the 3 stars are because some beer items were good and a couple of food items hit the spot if you're hungry."

Came w/ a fairly large group for some holiday celebration vibes and had a fantastic time gathering at GBC! The beer is great, with a wide array of options, all made well. Several fun seasonals that I really enjoyed. We spent time both inside and out and and great vibes in both spaces. Very kid friendly, but the way it is setup if you prefer to stay away from little ones, you certainly can. The food was great, with all in the group mentioning how great it was. Great service, efficient but still that central Texas charm. Drink local!"

It was a little messy, but that's the sign of a good burger.  Am I right?  My only criticism out of the entire experience is that they could have a little better napkins.  I know it sounds petty, but it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance Gather Brewing Company."

The beer is the best I've had (I'm not just saying that) Mike knows what he's doing!!! The decor is modern and unique; the staff is kind and efficient. Their attention to detail in every area is very impressive. The San Antonio area was begging for a place like this and Gather Brewing Co sure delivered! Thanks again guys, I'll be back... often. Haha"

It took some time to finish building the brewery but the end product is worth the wait. If I had to choose a favorite it would be Brew-s-a (IPA) but all of them are delicious. Can't wait to go back for more!"

The food was awesome and better than any brewery offerings I've had in San Antonio.  You can tell they put just as much thought into the food as they did the beer.  We had their Boar Burger and Korean Wings which were were both great.  The beer was so easy to drink and had such a good flavor.  We had the lager, an IPA and their double IPA.  I can't wait to frequent this place as often as I can."

I had the Asian wings and the hub at their Asian inspired tacos. We had one of their pretzels for app and it was huge and came with 3 dipping sauces. Everything was delicious! A plus is that there's a kids play section on the patio, so it's great for both family night, and date night! (I'll snag a picture when we get a chance to visit again!)"

                "description": "Super excited to have another local brewery in town! The beer was pretty decent and the food was tasty. The biggest issue was the outdoor area setup. There is a zone specifically dedicated for kids to play; while being family friendly is wonderful, the kids were screaming and parents were not paying attention. The space is too small to cater to children without creating a negative experience for others. At the end of the day, this is a brewery and it was difficult to have conversations while sitting outside due to kids hitting each other with the foam toys and just generally causing a ruckus being kids (which is fine...as long as it's in the appropriate environment)."

Most on tap were IPAs or unique blends.  Pretzel tasted great, but $11 is a bit too much for an appetizer for me.  Would also like to see the prices of the beers.  Nice place but probably only for special occasions for me."

It wasn't very busy and we were immediately seated in a nice booth that created the illusion of separation. I couldn't see anything behind me! This is a good thing btw!  We ordered some drinks and apps for the table. A couple Old Fashions, Mexican tea, and a drink off the secret menu that was delicious but I can't remember the name. The drinks were beautiful and tasty.  For the table we had the lemony hummus, the charcuterie, the hot Nashville chicken sliders, a cheeseburger, and honey butter chicken biscuit.  The lemony hummus came with fresh, crispy carrots, watermelon radishes, and celery. The hummus was creamy and tangy. It has a lot of dill, but I didn't mind that at all.  The chicken was a tad burned, but it was good the biscuit was soft and yummy, but it could have used a little more honey. I think the cheeseburger was the star. It was perfectly cooked and just hit the spot. The fries were also good. Just what I wanted!  The charcuterie was tiny, but it had some great treats.   And our waiter was phenomenal. He was attentive and super engaging. He gave us lots of information and we had a lot of fun small talk with him too."

You cannot go wrong with anything on the food or drink menu. You will not be disappointed."

Server was nice but food took so long at one point she said it would be here but then It didn't come for another 30 minutes, this was around 4 pm  When it arrived, the scallops had enormous amounts of sausage like ham. Not sprinkled but probably a third of the dish. This was NOT in the menu. It was hard to push aside there were so many and we were afraid to send any food back due to the time it took to arrive. We had 2 orders of scallops around $35 each for only 3 scallops.  We also ordered the special meat loaf, that was good.  Bring a sweater, it is freezing in there and certain booths have the air blowing directly at you.  Interesting place, but too pricey for what you get... not much."

                "description": "So this place always comes up on my searches so my husband and I decided to give it a try. When I go to a restaurant I like to evaluate it not only on a basis of food, but also the theme. The servers are in character - they are dressed as if they are mechanics with trucker hats. Nice touch to the restaurant given that it has an overall vintage gas station/industrial look.   Space/layout: Definitely a fun place to go to for brunch. They can accommodate large parties and have a bar. The decor around the restaurant are instgrammable, so if you are into that go ahead and cop yourself a pic.  Food: Not gonna lie, the food we order was a little bit more on the saltier side (Dirty Hash and the Shakshuka). Not sure if it was the cook that day or if the cook over shot the salt, but my husband and I had a difficult time finishing our food since it was a tad bit salty. Portion is great, presentation is amazing, but too salty. I am willing to give this place another try. Other than the saltiness, the food here is really good. But come thru and see how the food taste yourself!   P.S. Order a biscuit, it's really, really good here! Homemade and fresh."

He paid a Tribute to the King!!  So, when we walked in, there were two hostesses at the front. They asked if we had reservations, which we did not. I told them it was fine, that we could walk next door to Krause's and next time I would make a reservation.  Well, all I can say is that those two hostesses moved heaven and earth to accommodate us! They perused the seating chart and came up with a 'plan' for us. As long as we could be done by 6:30p they had a table for two. We told them that we had to be at the Brauntex at 6:30p, so all was good.  At first, we thought they were just going to sit us in the back room.  LOL  We didn't realize that the restaurant went that far back.  And our waitress (Can't remember her name!) What a hoot. She was a pleasure to have. Answered all of our questions about the menu, etc. She brought water out in this cool bottle ... She told me I could have it ... And then wrestled it out of my arms when I tried to leave ... Just Kidding!! And then our food came. It was delicious!  And we were walking out of the restaurant at 6:30p.  KUDOS to everyone that took care of us!"

She was pleasant, knowledgeable and had a very pleasant demeanor.  We had the following lunch item - because breakfast was NOT available.   Sandwiches: 1. Meatball - I had grilled jalapeños- the sandwich was very good.  2. BLT - we were told that it had fried green tomatoes. The sandwich had red fried tomatoes and caused the sandwich to be mushy.  3. Ruben - it was hand cut pieces of corned beef. The sandwich was very fatty and my son could only eat half of the sandwich.   The place was very clean and nice. We will try it again - but make it to Bruch and try the eggs, pancakes and French toast."

Downtowner is a GastroCraft hotspot with some great live music evenings. The bar manager and bartenders are excellent and watching them work is great entertainment. Their craft beer selection is excellent and their wine selection is solid. The crafty menu is very good as the pics show but they may want to consider healthier more vegetarian options for that rapidly growing demographic. Their folks are super friendly.   You really should check it out!   Make reservations!"

Greg was so awesome and fun to talk to while we were there. They have growlers and crowlers you can get filled, as well as bring in your own growler for a fill. The inside is dog-friendly.  My only meh about this place is that there are 3-4 taps with Guadalupe Brewing's beer. Don't get my wrong, I love them, but they are right down the road, so to me it doesn't make sense to have that many of theirs on tap, especially since my husband and I frequent local breweries.  Can't wait to see what else they bring in and are excited to go back!"

                "description": "In the latest wave of gentrification in this town, it seems like all I can find are hipster breweries that serve \"craft\" beer and overpriced food served on rectangular plates. If you like that kind of crap, go to aqua brew, you animal. If you want to go somewhere with cheap drinks and cool people (and if you live north of campus like this guy), look no further than Treff's. Some highlights.  You call it nights and you call it week:  Every Sunday, Treff's does $2.50 you call its, and $2.00 you call its on Tuesday. In addition to that, Treff's picks one week out of every month to be You call it week. That means $2 you call its all week. Going there, getting piss drunk, and stumbling back to my apartment, is among my fondest memories.   Atmosphere:  This place is dirty and divey in the best of ways. I used to go here with my friend from work all the time, and I always enjoyed seeing the bartenders and regulars. Really interesting people. Another upside is the patio, which allows filthy smokers like myself to smoke, drink, and have interesting conversations with other people. Another thing to mention, though, is that Treff's is much more of working people's bar. If you're a frat bro or sorority girl looking to blow mommy and daddy's money on a night of partying, you probably won't have a lot in common with the people here.  The glasses: This is just a little nitpick of mine, but I always hate going to the square and getting served drinks in a plastic cup. Treff's gets ridiculously busy some nights, and they still manage to serve all of their booze in glass, which is something I like. On another note, the bartenders here are absolute rock stars, and they don't take shit from anyone.   I haven't gone in a while since I don't have anyone to go with, but you can bet your ass the first place I'm taking my girlfriend when she turns 21 is gonna be Treff's."

He has expanded, added alot of TV s and updated the interior, but it will never be the place it was in the late 80's.  Keep blowing smoke, Patrick, - the Green Parrot is calling your name."

Can't beat it. Karaoke is also offered on Sundays, which is my favorite day to visit. Different events are hosted just about every day of the week. Although they don't serve food, they allow you to order at the restaurants near by and enjoy it there while washing it down with a cold alcoholic drink. Pretty awesome!"

A few minutes later another friend met up with us and brought a round of shots. Within 10 minutes of being there a bouncer came up to us and told us we need to leave because we were \"too drunk\". I told him we weren't and we hadn't drank at all before we got there, we had all just been at a work function. He told us the bartender saw us walking to the bathroom \"looking drunk\". He wouldn't let us finish our drinks that we had just been served and only made the 4 people with shots out of my friend group leave. I think the staff there is racist just like other reviews are saying. Won't be coming back."

As a longtime bartender being served by a long term bartender, when I'm told \"wells are $2\" I trusted that Chad would be honest with us. Instead, he took us to the cleaners. If I could give no stars I would. I have been in San Marcos for over 10 years. About 6 years ago I was man-handled by a door guy for no reason. I did not return to Treff's for almost 4 years. Since then, I have gone back a handful of times in hopes that it was just \"one bad apple\", but now I see that the employees at Treff's are out for nothing more than money. Even the door guy tonight was short and smile-less. I have received nothing less than awful service at this bar and I will not be returning."

Whiskey Sours only $3.50 and then they have some killer drink specials during the week I believe on Sundays and Tuesdays they have -You - Call -  Its- for only $2!!

Their selection of beers was so/so, although I had heard that they had more than what they actually had.  The parking lot was awful. Construction going on and one way in and out. Only about 10-13 cars could park and you can forget it if you're driving a truck, as the guy driving a f250 found out after hitting the parked Mercedes.  Not a great place for a huge group of people, but not bad for a San Marcos bar. When visiting just be wary of the parking lot and crazy drivers."

Well, as usual, we squished into a parking spot in the front of the tavern, walked in and sat at an open bar stool. I ordered an Ace pear cider and started chatting with friends while the jukebox was going with a vast array of music choices! Thats the beauty of a jukebox and I love the diversity!  Okay so I decided to check in (via Yelp) and saw that they had an offer for $2 drinks which really excited me because it wasn't a Tuesday and I still could get some $2 drinks? HELL YEAH!  WELLLLLLL.... it was more like a HELLLLLL NO because the bartender didn't allow me to redeem my deal. He even said he texted the owner and that the owner had no idea what kind of deal I was talking about? Well, the offer is still open on my Yelp app and I plan to find the owner next time I'm at the bar and ask him about it because that offer didn't magically come to be!!!  Anyway, yes Treff's is a super chill, casual and cool bar but they lost some points with not accepting my Yelp offer (I mean that's what the offers are there for hellloooooo)!! Guess I'll stick to only going in on Tuesdays..."

Bartender was serving us and she was unavailable. Saw some lady tucked behind the fountain machine on her cell phone and when I asked for help she said she wasn't on the clock. I'll assume that to be true. Looked outside and saw the bartender having a smoke and putting on makeup. I walked outside to let her know about it and didn't request anything in return. She apologized and offered to reimburse my card (I paid cash prior to my finding and a 30% tip to which I should have taken back, but I did not).   Hope this isn't indicative of their sanitation practices and overall service, but know I won't return as a result of my first experience with this establishment."

                "description": "I went this past Sunday at lunch.  There were maybe three tables sat when we got there.  We ordered the onion rings appetizer.  They were very good except for the ketchup tasted spoiled.  We ordered three burgers where they charge you for the cheese and a different bread if you want it.  I chose the Jalapeno cheese bread.  After waiting about 40 minutes our waitress comes out and says they ran out of hamburgers but rest assured they were making some and ours would be fresh!  My family laughed and said, what had they not ran out would they not be fresh?  Needless to say and hour passed by and our food finally came out.  Trusting the yelp 4 start review I'm ready to eat!  Well my Jalapeno and cheese bun came out and it had no Jalapeno or cheese in it and it was the type that is old and falls apart and was fermented.  I almost asked for my $1.50 back for the upgrade but my family said let's just get out of here and forget about it and not come back.  So for $52 we received an order of onion rings and three burgers and no drinks.  A sign of the situation as well, the table next to us complained of the hot sauce for their tacos being spoiled.  Their 4 star review may have been earned in the past but this place is not something I will ever be looking forward to.  ****Update*****We used my Mastercard here to eat and didn't use the card anywhere else.  I've received two fraudulent charges on the card now.  A girl by the name Jessica used the card to buy pizza in Seguin."

It's a smaller restaurant with plenty of seating and a full bar (although pretty simple draft choices).  The prices are good, and the food is great! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on sourdough. It came out fresh and melted in my mouth. I can't say I have had a chicken burger this fresh and moist...ever! My husband got the Texan which was great as well- not too much bbq sauce and the flavors went together great.  While we didn't have room for anything else other than beer, I would definitely be back. Very dive bar feel with what seemed like 98% \"locals\" or return guests as everyone was mingling with the bartenders a lot. I am happy to say this didn't affect our service since the bartenders were the waitstaff as well.  Definitely check it out! Also karaoke on Saturdays!"

The only problem is that it's already the regular spot for a LOT of people so you better start taking lunch breaks early.  I came with a work friend and got a decent table ala \"seat yourself\". Lots of burger options and that's what they are known for. I had the Texas burger on a bun. Usually, it comes on Texas toast (of course). It was ginormous and well done. The pile of bacon on it was - it amazes me to write this - almost too much. I think there was more bacon than beef. Also a couple onion rings and bbq sauce made this an awesome meal.  For a side I had the tater tots which were tasty and well cooked.   I would have liked speedier service, but the three women serving this place were flat out slammed and doing an impressive job of keeping up with the flow. So go, be patient, and don't fill the place up!"

Drawn in by the media buffet above the bar (football, football, football, Simpsons, football, football...something for errbahduh!), we parked it there.  There's a great list of pre-built burgers, but also a long list of carb jacket (definitely go for the jalapeño cheddar! Definitely. ) and topping choices from which to build your own. He orders the Australian burger and I beer, I go for a much more Texan option: chicken fingers and fries basket, white pepper gravy duh, and a sweet tea (Don't judge! We had just spent all afternoon at  brewery, and I hadn't eaten. Adultin' like a mofo!) The waitress was kind enough to suggest that the fries in my basket would be enough for both of us. ..\"*if* I felt sharing\", lol. Well played, ma'am! And much appreciated tip, seriously! ...and indeed they were. A very short few minutes later, a veritable mountain of food was placed in front of  us.  Burger: Super!! Chicken and gravy: Really really good. Fries: Old eff'n Bay!!! Yaaayyyy!  Sweet Tea : holy shit, use the lemon! Super sweet and delicious with it. Without citrus...drinking Karo sizzurp through a straw lol.  Bellies : full.  To-go box: also full.  Bartender: Badass"

Decided to try it out for Mother's Day. NOT for us. Burger was large, but very greasy and lacking in flavor. We asked for extra crispy sweet potato fries, I've had more flavorful and crispy sweet potato fries frozen out of a bag. Menu was a la cart, so we spent way more than we should have for in my opinion, poor quality food.  Customer service (if you can even call it that) was non existent. Will not go back. Pat's Place is definitely much better, unfortunately they're closed on Sunday's.  For the lovely folks letting their small kids scream and fight over the pool table, pool sticks/balls, AND use a stick with no tip on the felt, unsupervised, I'm thinking Chucky Cheese is probably a better choice next time."

                "description": "Today, for 8 hours, I've been thinking about downing a hand-formed, griddled hamburger. Where to go? My criteria: new place, no tips, local, inexpensive, and at least a 1/2 pounder,   There are not many places to get hamburgers over here. There is Smashburger, which has been getting horrible ratings, Chilis (my favorite), Texas Roadhouse, Gruene River Grill, the Phoenix Saloon, and Pat's place. Now, places where you can get away without paying a tip--whether that is through the drive though or takeout--are GG's Corner Cafe (Marion), Blakes's Cafe (McQueeney), Kirby's Korner (Seguin), the Longhorn Cafe (New Braunfels), and today's addition with Landa Station.     This dive bar is located about a block past Landa Park. While looking at their menu online, I noticed that all of their burgers are 1/2 pounders (plus); they have one pounders also, chicken sandwiches, and Mexican food (cool). This is a bar folks!  I went through the drive though, after phoning in my order 10 minutes earlier. I ordered a patty melt ($5.75) because I haven't had one since I was a teenager, ions ago. The patty melt was described as a 1/2 pound burger, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on a buttered, Texas Toast. I must have arrived 5 minutes too late because my \"toast\" was no longer toasted. Either it was not toasted enough, or it steamed in that Styrofoam box and turned back into bread.      The burger was huge, juicy, and was cooked medium, as I had ordered (plus), the onions were great; however, the cheese was a white cheese sauce, or poor quality cheese (I think the former). The cheese seemed almost like white cheese whiz. If these burgers could be improved, I would only serve Wisconsin cheeses. I would pay 75 cents more.  They also have chopped pork, chicken, and many burger combinations. Because of the price, the drive through, and hand formed burgers, I will definitely be back. Oh, and on Wednesdays, when you buy a burger, you get a beer for 10 cents (probably inside only)."

We were promptly seated by a super sweet hostess. We have a toddler and we were able to grab the booth highchair on the way to our table instead of getting to the table and then waiting for a highchair. I know that doesn't mean a lot, but 90% of the restaurants we visit, we have to wait for them to seat us then they bring a highchair to our table. By them having the booth highchairs at the hostess station, they are \"working smarter, not harder\". Big kudos the them for that.  Our waiter was (forgive me for I didn't catch his name) was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and helpful for all questions.   I had the Cherry Limeade to go along with the Gringo Dip and Chips we ordered for our appetizer. Both the limeade and the chips/dip were outstanding. I would recommend both.  For entrees, we had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Havana Club. The French dip is the first sandwich listed and I didn't read any further. I'm a sucker for a good French Dip and this sandwich delivered. The wife commented that her Havana Club was delicious as well. The kids had grilled cheeses with fries. All looked great and they devoured them.  All in all, this is the spot you're wanting for an easy off/on when traveling north on I-35. We'll be back when we are in the area."

Thanks to a friends recommendation we tried it today. Seriously the best steaks that we have had in a restaurant. They were literally cooked perfectly. It was the right amount of portions. I also got the basil lemonade. Our waitress was super sweet and efficient. Both my husband and I give this place a two thumbs up."

The chocolate cake and ice cream were very tasty.  The service was impeccable!"

After tonight we will no longer be returning to 54th street restaurant. We had family come in from 2 hours away to try the food we always talk about, and were turned away, REFUSE us service because our party of 13 was \"too large\". Yet there was a party of 12 that didn't show for their reservation and still we were refused service. It was supposed to be the graduation dinner for my fiance and this is how it turned out. It is not our fault that the restaurant is understaffed, but losing us as loyal customers definitely is their fault. Save your time and $ take your family somewhere else."

Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My daughter ordered the butter penne pasta with side of sweet strawberries, ice cream and strawberry lemonade. The lemonade was fresh and not overly sweet.  My husband had ribs. My friend had ribeye with blackened shrimp. Everything was tasty.  Waiter tried but kept forgetting stuff. We didn't get straws till 20 min after our drinks were served. Like no one got straws to drink.   then he kept forgetting the refills and my glass of water.  My 5 yo noticed and commented on the server's forgetfulness. He was nice but he's obviously new-- he didn't know the menu well at all. But it's fine, we had a good dinner. Price was very decent."

I had the Havana Club sandwich with the Chicken Tortilla Soup on the side and the Key Lime Pie for dessert. The sandwich was great! Pretty big and definitely worth the price. The soup was also good as well. The pie was great and unlike any other pie I've had, tangy and with amazing crust.  Overall the atmosphere of the restaurant was great, especially for the night time. Its got a cluttered pop-culture type decor style, similar to that of Beyond Burger, nice dim lighting, and huge comfortable booths. Our waitress was also very kind and did a great job. I highly recommend this place, especially in the night time for the atmosphere."

To start we ordered a Four Play, I regret not having a photo, but I can tell you it was delicious, the sauces that accompany this order were excellent, all excellent, the fried potatoes, the mozzarella, the spicy chicken but with a good flavor.  In addition this time we ordered the same Plate, Flat-iron steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes, I found the steak cooking to be perfect, as well as the shrimp just right.  We recommend a delicious beergarita.  Only you have to prepare your wallet, it is not cheap, but you will enjoy it."

A gentleman from North face recommended it to us and we are thankful we listened. The best way I can describe this place is a pub like feel with amazing pub like food and even better personal service! The gluten free menu was AMAZING and I felt safe eating here as a celiac! The rest of our group had plenty of option as well. Two of us had burgers and the other had soup and sandwich and we enjoyed every bite! Jeanne was our server (hope I spelt that correctly) and she did a great job helping us choose menu items! If we ever come back to Austin/San Marcos this will be a stop on our list!! The gluten free burger was so good, the bun was not crumbly or taste like cardboard but perfect! I actually took home half of the bun to eat later... ha! Thanks 54th Street, it was great!"

YES social distancing is enforced, YES there is sanitizer available at the entrance.  Service was great, beverage selections always great here esp if you like craft brew. My choice here is Jeremiah Red if you like a bock or amber beer.  The calamari we ordered for appetizer was plenty to share between the two of us..could definitely split three ways and fresh and not rubbery or tough. We also split the delicious Ahi Tuna salad and a small pizza.  The tuna could have had a better sear, like the salad  I had here couple years ago.  Now I will say the pizza is deep dish pie, and I felt fell a bit short on the cheese, but the buttery soft crust was delicious.  The pizza did take nearly 20 minutes before arriving to our table...good time for conversation with company and enjoying your drinks, so be prepared for the wait.   Menu is online and paying your bill is also taken care of online.  No exchanging paper or using a shared pen to sign your tab."

A gentleman sat at the bar and was either psychologically going through something or simply on drugs.  The bartenders were women and immediately we all noticed something wasn't right.  One of the ladies asked for the manager...but apparently because of his size or i don't know what he did nothing and eventually sent the chef out to talk the the guy.  This didn't work and the man continued talking to demons and requesting wine. Finally the manager came out and talked to the guy and walked him out.   But i feel like it should have been handled more quickly as the employees obviously didn't feel safe."

Pizza was ordered with instructions to please do not drizzle with garlic aioli sauce and put on side, but there its is drizzled.  The pizza was already cold and nothing else had to be cooked so I am guessing the delay in time was grub hub but when the only Instructions you leave are please don't drizzle, then unless you are Mother Nature, then please don't drizzle."

So since everyone is obsessed with BJs I'm going to focus on the positives of BJs instead of listing what I don't like about BJs.  Really enjoyable sports pub in the north burbs of San Antonio (far north on I-35) which I visited on two occasions - mostly because it's right off the highway, so when we're in this part of town and somebody wants to meet up with me (a specific dude, basically) this is usually his choice because he thinks it's more convenient for me. I told him on a number of occasions that I'd rather go five miles off the highway to some amazing little ethnic hidden gem, but he's always like, no this one's easier and it's my favourite place anyway - I think it's easier for him more than me, 2 mins drive and he's right there.  I do like it though, and good memories here for us. For a sports bar it has pretty good food and he's all about the alcohol and they have a good selection, and pretty decent prices as well for that matter."

We have never had an experience like this before with BJ's Restaurants. Please chat with your employees about their attitudes and figure out an actual time frame."

I ask \"hey why did you change the channel?\" I know you are gonna think I'm making this up, but I'm not... the manager comes out and tells me.. WITH a straight face... \" BJ's is a family restaurant and we cannot show violent sports\". I'm sorry, this place is listed as a sports bar, am I at Chuck-E-Cheese? So I can't watch boxing, but I can watch football which can be even more violent??? (I know it's Canadian which is like two hand touch, but still.)  What a joke!!! Oh, FYI not one millennial in sight to cry about any of this. BJ stands for Best Joke!!"

The manager went the extra mile in making sure my son could eat the fries by having some made on the side to avoid any cross contamination. He also double checked labels for us. The service was top notch. We will definitely visit this location in the future."

She does her job to a Tee, and is really great at what she does.  However this particular time We had a new bartender (male) that was pouring drinks poorly, not mixing them like a great mixologist should. Had it not been for Brooke this would be a 3 star review   Now I have to say There are other great servers and bartenders there also but just had to share this experience.  I appreciate great service and a great mixologist and BJ's normally has them"

OK yes, it is somewhat of a hole in the wall, or for that matter quaint, picturesque, salon, on the side of the road. Walked in and were greeted by Heidi (one of the owners), she told us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we saddled up to the bar.  Yes, small bar, but very adequate, plenty of tables to sit inside, and outside.   Craving a burger, but not wanting the bun, started reviewing the wraps.  My husband and I both ordered wraps and a order of onion rings.   My Santa Fe with ground beef was wonderful, the cheese was creamy, the beef tender with just a hint of spice.  My husband enjoyed the Alamo wrap and it disappeared.  OH, don't let me forget the salsa she gives you with the wrap, I don't remember what it was but it was super with kick!  The onion rings we shared (small order), was the perfect amount for two people, they were fresh and hot!  We are not dippers, so we did not take Heidi up on the sauces she offered for the rings. If ever back in this neck of the woods, we WILL be back!"

Upon arrival parking was easy and they have plenty of room. You can see a lot of picnic tables and small playground set.   I'm giving 3 stars because the lady who took our order was super rude. I would ask a question and it was met with so much attitude and unwillingness to help. If it wasn't for me treating a friend to lunch I would have completely walked away from this place.   The bright side was that the food turned out really good. We split an order of sweet potato fries bc it's a huge serving. I ordered the Santa Fe wrap which is Pepper Jack, black beans, corn, rice, chipotle spread with avocado (vegetarian option). It was really pleasing, wrap done right. They also have a nice selection room of craft beers."

To me, once they change the buns on the burgers, I want a burger now. I didn't like the buns before, so I started getting the wraps, which are delicious, now I'm hooked on the BLT. Plus this place has a friendly staff, they do get busy, so the wait for food may be awhile, but the beer selection is pretty decent.   One draw back is the bathroom, just one."

They weren't wearing masks or gloves, so keep that in mine when going.  The had a little park thing and a bunch of outside seating, so it's great if you have a family!  We didn't get to try any of the beers.  The Cali club was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The maverick was good but again, there was nothing special about it.  The loaded fries were good, but it wasn't as presentable as I could make it myself at home. It also felt like it had waited out for a while before it got to us.  There was nothing really special about this place, but the food was ok."

It was ok. The sauce tasted like thousand island. Nothing made it special. The menu stated it came with fries, but he didn't get any. I ordered the Hollywood taco. The shredded chicken was GREAT. The price for what I got was high. Just a normal sized taco you would make at home. The tortilla tasted like an H‑E‑B tortilla, not bad just ok. The meat was topped with a few kernels of corn and fresh diced jalapeño. The verde sauce was mediocre. Again nothing special. I added fries to my order and they were good, Very crispy. They were out of fried pickles which was a huge let down since it was one of the reasons we chose to give this place a shot, but I'm not holding it against them with the supply shortages going on right now.  Overall everything was ok, but didn't seem worth the drive or the price."

                "description": "Came here with the family after doing Natural Bridge Caverns. First, be prepared to sit outside, there's not much room inside, especially during the social distancing times. However, even though it was over 90 degrees outside the shade and breeze kept it cool enough to be pleasant. Kids had a playground to okay on - though it was a bit past it's prime.   The ordering seemed a bit haphazzard, which seemed to be due to only have one employee working front of house despite it being rush hour lunch time. This caused me to have to stand at the bar for considerable amounts of time waiting to order or when I went to get a beer. Hopefully this was just someone not showing up for a shift and not a perpetual issue.   Now for the food. I had a Santa Fe wrap. Standard Mexican ingredients, but all together tasty. My wife's burger wrap with fries in the wrap looked quite good. Kids chicken strips were solid quality. The fries had good flavor and crunchy outsides. Beer selection was surprisingly good (Blood and Honey automatically  means I'm happy).   Solid, if not spectacular experience."

The entire wrap was rice, it was so hard to eat because of the amount of rice made the wrap so dry. It hardly had any chicken, mine had maybe a 3 little pieces of chicken bits and about 6 black beans. Just a drop of sauce and no cheese or corn. I should have taken a pic but I had to open mine up to remove the big glob of rice. Same with my friends. Our sons loved their burger and grilled cheese. Next time I will try a burger but for being called wraptitude, I was expecting a good wrap."

The food was really tasty and fries were delicious. The main issue here was that they seemed to be understaffed and weren't set up very well for social distancing. They have a very small seating area and bar inside and several picnic tables and outdoor seating options. While you can spread out just fine outside, you have to go inside of the crowded small building to place your order. It was a very small space with too many people inside close together. Also, the fountain drinks and cups were self-serve set up right next to where everyone was standing. If they had online or outside ordering so that you could avoid going inside, it would really improve things."

                "description": "This was the 1st meal while in Texas, and we dare say it was superb. The guy running the restaurant was super chill and energetic. The atmosphere was relaxing with the eclectic decor.  The hubs had the burger wrap while I had 3 tacos (pork, asada, and avutarian). We also shared the half-loaded fries.  The fries were amazing! Usually with these types of dishes, the fries become soggy or aren't even crispy to begin with. These had a crunch even to the last few pieces. And not to mention, it was loaded with a lot of beef and bacon pieces. What a value for the amount of meat that's in it.  His burger wrap was seriously da bomb. All the 46 sauce and ingredients stuffed inside the wrap was just oozing outwards. The wrap consisted of beef, bacon bits, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions -- pretty much what a burger is. Biting into this was a wowing moment. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My tacos were okay. They weren't superb (standard lettuce, cheese, lime, and tomatillo salsa). I wouldn't rec it as this place isn't known for their tacos:  * Asada: The avocados were creamy. This was prob the freshest and tastiest of the 3 tacos. * Avutarian: The flavors were faint at most. There wasn't much wow or anything that made this taco look nor taste diff. * Pork: The flavors were lacking, and the pork looked super bland (see the only close-up pic worth taking).  Everything about this experience was 5 stars minus my taco choices. The loaded fries and burger wrap were just mind-blowing delicious and at a great price.  Though there were limited parking spaces in the front, the back had plenty of nooks and crannies you could squeeze your car into."

So far I've had the maverick and the big kahuna burgers... both options were delicious and  were cooked just right every time (I hate when burgers are over cooked). I wish I would have taken a picture before I devoured them lol. They have some of the best onion rings out of most places we've tried and fresh crispy fries. Live music line up during spring, summer, and I think into fall on Friday's and Saturday's. The cornhole and play area keep the kiddos busy which is awesome because the kids can work up an appetite while waiting for the food to come out. We love bringing our out of state visitors here because the employees are also so darn nice! Y'all must try it!!!!"

Service was intermittent but with a good attitude, so we were able to get our food in a timely manner.

                "description": "Thursday night we decided to celebrate my wife's birthday,  since they do not take reservations and did not want to chance sitting outside waiting for a table we went at 5:30pm. We were able to park close and was seated right away. We loved the look and feel of the court yard and restaurant.  Cozy is how we described it. Our server was attentive and we passed on appetizers but order a bottle of French sauvignon blanc wine. Very good wine at a reasonable price point. We both ordered the 7oz loin steak. I opted for chicken tortilla soup, tasty thick soup but it was not very hot (Temperature). My wife had the salad with blu cheese dressing (good quality). We were pleased that our entrees did not arrive until we finished our soup/salad course. Again a point of proper service by our server. Our loin steaks were proper Temperature and had a great char crust. Great tasting. Green beans were fresh and cooked with still a bite to them. Roasted potatoes were nice.  For dessert we ordered black coffee that was fresh, cheesecake and a chocolate cake with ice cream. Desserts were very good.  We highly recommend and we return soon"

                "description": "My new favorite place in New Braunfels! I had a work meeting here and I was looking forward to eating at a restaurant that I have not been to before. I had seen all of the great reviews and even had some friends that Have recommended this place.  I love the decor and the house feel to this restaurant. We were seated right away and the service was top notch. I got the tortilla soup which I recommend and I ordered the steak with the port wine reduction sauce with blue cheese. I am picky about my steaks partly because I think I am pretty decent at cooking my own. This steak did not disappoint and the sauce was amazing.  Afterwards I had the cheesecake which was not only good but also the perfect size. If you are in New Braunfels you need to make a visit here and check this place out!"

My issue was the food quality. I have run restaurants and I know what should and should not be on a plate, especially with such a busy place. The salad was wilted. My tomatoes were starting to shrivel. The bread had been frozen and not thawed all the way before they cooked it. The meat was a lower grade than we were expecting.   Sometimes it's hard for me to eat out having shopped for three cafes and been a chef for 10 years, so take this review knowing I'm very picky.  My expectations are probably higher than they should be."

The people who work there are friendly.   The parking is difficult but the food is worth the trouble. Huisache's meals are one of a kind.  They take fairly ordinary recipes and add little twists.  Those twists make their entrees taste marvelous. Well done Huisache Grill!"

The mashed potatoes were dried out. The meat was over cooked. And the waitress was inattentive.    This place used to be a gem prior to the pandemic.  I would recommend it to people from out of town.  Now, I will just warn them to not waste their money here."

                "description": "Came here for the first time about 1 week ago. I loved the location, the atmosphere was romantic and cozy. My husband and I thought the place was beautiful, however the food was ok. We started off with some wine, the moscato was great and added to the ambiance. We had the broiled spinach and artichoke dip.  I was expecting a traditional dip, but let me tell you what we got was not average at all. The dip seemed to have a hint of lime in it. My husband loved it, it was not for me. I can more closely describe it to tasting like corn in a cup. They also serve it with bread and chips. For an entre, I had the parmesan breaded chicken breast. It was stuffed with mushroom's, spinach, cheese and  artichoke hearts, served with a side of penne pasta and broccoli. I wish that my chicken was stuffed significantly more. I could hardly taste the filling. The penne pasta was a little bland, but I did not mind it. The broccoli was cooked to perfection and I quite enjoyed it. My hubby got the 2oz mixed grill. He was satisfied, but mentioned it was not for him.   In conclusion, this place is worth a try, the location is beautiful, and they also have cats in their courtyard!"

I invariably look down at my house salad or side veggies and think, another disappointment. For the first time last night, we tried Huisache Grill. With my first bite of the house salad, I did a double take! Fresh! Beautifully prepared and presented. Delicious salad dressing. What?!  I come from a state where veggies are often served within a day of harvest. This salad tasted like that!  Many Texans might think big deal, gimmie meat! Well, I eat meat too and the meat I ordered was also skillfully prepared and darned near perfect. Factor in a personable, efficient server and despite how busy the restaurant was, my husband and I had a delightful dinner! We will be back and soon!"

Yes, I know that restaurants are short staffed, but at least explain that to your customers before they have to wait 20 minutes to be asked for a drink order at the bar or wait while others that came after you got served first.  I have been to a half-dozen restaurants within a 1 mile radius of Huisache in the last two weeks.  They have NO problems with fast, fair, and friendly service.  I may give them another chance, but it will be awhile.  They need to work on it."

Not a great fan of their appetizers. The wine selection is on point. The steak which we split was cook to our perfection. The staff could use a better attire when working. Even though everyone wore some sort of black fabric. There was absolutely no consistency in the employees dress code. Thank goodness for the kitchen can cook. Which saves the lack of better dress."

No registers (normally manned) were open so only checking out at the front where the half-pints/pints/etc. are located.  Waited in line a few minutes, which was no big deal.  When I was called \"next\" I quickly requested a pint, but the guy checking me out was a complete jerk!! Rude, condescending and generally, I guess, in a bad mood.  No business should hire people like that!  Didn't thank me for the business ... just remained surly.  So, too many other liquor stores to put up with that crap and it will be my last visit to Spec's.  Oh, by the way Spec's, the holiday season is closely approaching and I normally spend my fair share during that time ... not this year for you!  You're like the liquor store nazi ... adios!"

The majority of the staff really knows their stuff and are eager to help you hunt anything down.   If you're walking in for the first time, don't let how huge the place is throw you off your game. Everything is well sorted and sectioned off so even if you don't want direction from staff, a quick skip down any aisle will give you an idea of what that section offers. There's usually a couple tastings near the entry, incentive while you're shopping, and the first Wednesday of every month there's a pretty big wine tasting (Usually 7-10 sections, each offering several samples.)  Beyond beer, wine, and spirits, Spec's offers some pretty swanky snack sections. Its a great place if you're wanting to build a gift basket for someone, or if you're in a hurry they have some pre-built gift baskets up for grabs, too.   The prices are pretty fair, I've never bought something and found it astoundingly differently priced anywhere else. They do offer good deals if you're paying cash instead of debit or credit, they give a military discount, and if you're a Spec's rewards member there are perks like first dibs whenever hard to get items come in. Its a pretty great option to scoop up everything you'd need in one stop."

If you have not been to Spec's, take a deep breath before you enter and remain calm... this place is HUGE!  Overwhelmingly huge.  While it is impossible for me to say they had everything known, I find myself wondering if it's possible that they don't have something.    Wall to wall to wall to end cap of wines, spirits beers and nick knacks.  I thoroughly enjoy my time here when I visit.  Staff are knowledgeable more so than I expect.  Shelves are fully stocked, price is usually fair and, sales pop up from time to time.  Overall a great experience and a nice place to go even if it is to just browse."

Employees all around the store. Two for curbside and no one was there. It took 15 minutes to check out one person.  No help for the one cashier. After checking the gentleman out he had to go get a box. I left.  Went to the one on Bander and 1604. More people in the store. Two cashers with someone assisting each cashier.  One person in front of me. Was in and out in 5 minutes."

                "description": "This is a huge store! In addition to their vast selection of liquor and large array of wine options they have special chocolaty treats to purchase and lots of fun bar and party snacks. They have cigars and cigar supplies. I usually frequent the Spec's at the Villages at Stone Oak but the wine guy there told me this store offers wine tasting on the first  Wednesday of the month so we decided to try it out. It  was a nice little event, 5 wine stations with at least 2 wines but most had 3-4 options to taste. There was a little tiny sample of a cheese, onion, and olive and a bonus station of bloody Mary tasting. I really like being able to taste affordable wines before purchasing and they offer them at case price if you purchase during the event. Only thing I would suggest is either bring your own palate cleansing cracker, etc or maybe Spec's could offer a small palate cleaning option at each station. I understand this is a free event but a small option should be  to much to ask for. Also, the pourers didn't seem to know to much about the wine, they were just pouring. However, I think it would have been more interesting if they would have known more about the wine/region/etc. Additionally, one can bring their own wine glass. I ended up purchasing some wines that I would have never purchased otherwise. Over all, pretty neat little free event and I will attend again for sure."

I feel like going into specialty stores like this are intimidating, because everyone seems to know what they want. My husband and I don't drink often, and it got overwhelming looking through all the variety of fine wines and liquors.  We had questions about vodka, and thankfully staff came up to us to give us recommendations on both local and nationwide brands. We decided to try some locally made vodka and WOW! One of the smoothest drinks I've ever had.   They also sell frozen foods, horderves, plates and silverware, which makes this place a perfect spot if you're looking to host a last minute get together or date!"

                "description": "I'm absolutely livid with the poor customer service practices at this Spec's in particular, and from this point forward will avoid Spec's altogether as much as I possibly can. Ugh!  I've been coming in to this store, in person, at least once per day for over a week, looking for a limited-release beer. On the first visit, a manager filled out a Special Order form with my contact info, assuring me that, while the beer would be sold on a first-come, first-serve basis with no holds,  I would receive a phone call when it was indeed in stock so I could haul over there in a hurry and pick one up. On each subsequent visit - the most recent being 8:30 last night - my phone number was confirmed and I was assured that I would receive a call when it was available.  With no call received, I stopped in this afternoon to check in, just in case, and was informed that the beer had come in this morning and sold out already, that they had deemed it, upon delivery, \"not fair\" to follow through with the promised phone call. Bullshit!  If that had been the case from the beginning, fine. 100% understandable. But given that it's acceptable practice for management to switch gears at the 11th hour and completely disregard their promises to me, I find that it would be *unfair* to my consumer conscience to continue to spend any money at store with such ridiculously poor customer service standards."

                "description": "Ladies and Gentlemen? I gotta give a mad shoutout to Spec's. But seriously folks. Can you really find something to complain about here? I tried to find the elusive bottle of Glen Deveron single malt scotch here as well. It was in the computer but I had no luck in procuring this Nectar of the Gods. But that is ok. The gentleman who assisted me took the time to look and found out he could not get it. I will not need to tell my own self to SHADDAPP!! because there is no need to whine or complain. In case you have not noticed the shelves are brimming with many other fine products to your liking. And not being able to find EXACTLY what you think you need is definitely a first world problem.   I would like to add that at this particular location I was able to procure some Absinthe spoons which I could not locate elsewhere. And this just made my girly man nipples erect with exhilaration. Otherwise I would have had to order the dang things online which I luckily avoided. And this is good because just like the rest of the crowd of habitually chronic complainers, I like immediate gratification. It is nice to see the object I wish to purchase. To touch it. Hold it. Imagine how good it will feel to impart it into use. Try this with a stripper in a club somewhere and you will get tossed out of there in a hurry. So this theory does not work everywhere. Be advised.   And the thing with Spec's is that you really can't beat their prices. And the selection of tequilas as well as wines is unsurpassed. I have never had a complaint for any gift I have purchased here for anybody here. Maybe that is because all my friends are alcoholics? NAH! It just means that I might be unimaginative when it comes to buying gifts such as liquor or cigars and resort to this. But it is great because my buddies can enjoy their cigars and liquor guilt free. If you have male friends who are married with three kids or more then always get them a good bottle of liquor and a few stogies for a gift. It will always hold you in the esteem of \"righteous dude\" status. Even if their wives don't particularly care for you.   And a few hours spent in their company for obligatory holiday visits will leave you invigorated upon departed their company. And you will also feel less sorry for your old buddy when you leave him with the ball and chain as well as the life to which he is fastened like a dog on a chain leash. What the hell else can you do? You told him not to marry her. Besides, you left him with a good bottle of whiskey. And now your work is done. You have been the best friend you can be!   I am your yelp buddy, Madman!! And you can always trust my reviews and I will never steer you wrong! Happy New Year! Don't be an idiot. Don't drink and drive! Unless you are swinging wood on the golf course. That's a much different kind of driving. There are other kinds of driving too. But I believe I have said quite enough already."

They also have everything you need to make mixed drinks and items for your food and cheese boards.  Spec's carry and wide variety of cheeses including Yancy Fancy which includes ghost pepper and habanero.  They also have special meats, olives, and nuts and different kinds of snacks.  Spec's even had caviar and different kinds of crackers.  Try the olives stuffed with blue cheese which has been hard to find lately.  The Spec's in South New Braunfels also have the same items, it's on 35 in the same shopping plaza as Planet Fitness.  Spec's goes above and beyond with customer service, if you take the name of a certain beer, wine, spirit they will look it up to see if they have it or can get it in.  Spec's is the one stop shop for entertaining or having what you need to sit at home while in this pandemic in front of the television watching a movie.  I felt very safe there with social distancing, hand sanitizer, and everyone wears a mask while shopping at Spec's.  Thank You Spec's!"

Just a pretty great selection of beers in general, but the Deep Ellum - especially when their seasonal cherry chocolate porter hits shelves - will bring me back to this particular Spec's...I can't think of a single place in San Antonio that stocks it.   I've been gravitating lately toward San Anto mom n pop bottle shops (and Dr. Seuss, apparently) - local is better anyway, but mostly because of the option to build-your-own mixed-6... As per the norm with Spec's, that's 100% not an option here (*lame*, Bunny!). There's also no chocolates counter, and their deli consists of a small selection of prepackaged cheeses. Oh yeah, another thing that's lacking: a purse hook in the ladies room. ..Ain't no way I'm setting my junk on the floor, and the fine art of hovering is extra difficult when you're trying not to pee on a crossbody bag AND the toilet seat.  But...  The store is bright/shiny/new, very spacious, and there's tons of parking. I was greeted enthusiastically at the door, and subsequently asked by no less than 3 associates (and not in that annoying \"what are you stealing? Watching you! \" kinda way) if I was finding everything OK. Eye contact and a smile from every passing employee... very welcoming.   On the way to the river, get your Beaver Nuggets across the street, but definitely leave the beer purchase for here."

This is very disappointing, since flavors of beer can drastically change."

We needed two bottles of champagne and didn't know what to get. The manager suggested a great brand with a decent price and it tasted great. We've had help with wine choices too. Huge selections on all spirits and beers.  Once I had to use the restrooms and I was surprised with how impeccably clean they were! This is our go to place for our alcohol needs."

                "description": "I come here for selection and they have it but today I found out they don't carry a common beer, leinenkugel sunset wheat. Another you can't buy any of the dogfish head beers individually. If you want me to spend a lot of money on a six pack an individual would be great first to try one. Trying to find someone to ask shouldn't be difficult but they hide around the corner talking amongst each other and not on the sales floor walking around helping people."

                "description": "I love Spec's, even if it's only because it's the closest place with a decent selection of craft beer.  Pros: Decent selection of liquor, especially Texas brands. Decent selection of craft beer in six-packs and bombers. Friendly staff.  Cons: No singles or mixed six-packs on beer. And only Josh seems to know much about beer (I keep missing him lately, as well. Either he's got an odd schedule or he's moved on.)  If Spec's would start selling singles, I'd have no reason to drive to the Gabriel's in San Marcos. I'd still drive to Total Wine once in a while, though."

I'm not sure of the beer selection, but it seemed massively diverse to me. I liked that they showed the Wine ratings on some of the bottles."

A great selection of pretty much every beer, wine and liquor! Good prices too! Would definitely go back!! Wish we had one closer to home! Didn't really check out the coffee, food or cigars... But seemed to have a fair amount of selection.."
