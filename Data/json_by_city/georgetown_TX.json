We were greeted with a \"I could care less attitude\" The place is obviously struggling  Merchandizing almost non existent We tasted all 4 of their products and theyre almost undrinkable When I asked where the bottles are she said, back here and pointed to some bottles laying behind the counter No offer to let me see one until I asked!   Its also a vineyard and winery but, I wasnt motivated to \"pull that out\" of the clerk also!!!  Seems like something shady about this place  Really  Dont waste your time"

                "description": "What a cool little family-owned distillery/winery hard off of 183 in Liberty Hill. They have bottle sales, a tasting room, and a spacious shaded outside patio. There is limited seating inside in the AC.   If you are a fan of the Netflix series you will get the \"don't worry it's his sister\" statues that greet you as you arrive.  Their bourbon is on point and it makes for a good old-fashioned. Plus 1 did not care for her initial cocktail a Cosmo. Her second drink was a Cab that for the price point was an excellent wine. It had legs and a smooth finish. It reminded her of a Josh Cab.  There is a pizza parlor on site. We did not partake but it looked like a pretty darn good thin crust pizza.  Barkeeps are friendly and knowledgeable. A return trip is definitely on the horizon.  Pro tip: It's a hard turn at their entrance on a fast stretch of Hwy so use your blinker!"

We wanted to buy a bottle for the upcoming 4th of July weekend. and we got to try 4 of their selections. The texagave, gin, triple session and whiskey. I was happy with all of them.  Texagave is their \"tequila\". I thought it had a great taste and would make a great margarita. My wife, who is a tequila drinker, wasnt too fond of it, but I loved it and it would make a great add to any bar.  Gin. It tasted twice as good as Tanqueray but with half the bite/harshness. we bought 2 bottles. Will be back for all the Gin needs.  Whiskey. If youre a fan of Gentleman Jack youll love this! super smooth and mellow. I thought it was good (im a bourbon drinker), just not the Super Oaky flavor that Im used to. too mellow for my taste.  Triple Session. This was by far the most impressive and different spirit I tried. Think of a triple sec (orange and sweet flavor) but with actual alcohol in it. I think it is 41% and it tastes fantastic over ice, not to harsh, not to sweet (by triple sec standards) but just right. Cant beat if for less than 15 bucks a bottle at total wine.  I cant wait till I try the rest of their spirits. Go in and try them, you will not be disappointed!"

Scott (the founder) was very welcoming and showed us the different spirits that they had to offer.   The TexAgave is perfect for people that like tequila, the 17 Whiskey is great for the bourbon drinker, and Whit's Gin is really tasty too.  I didn't have a chance to try all of them but I'm sure the others not mentioned are great.   Some of us ordered the Bill Pickett Bulldog which was made with their JavaGave Coffee Liqueur and it was like Kahlua and Milk but way better. Highly recommend that drink!  Most of their drinks are $4!"

                "description": "My wife and I stumbled across this place on a Sunday.  The owner,  Scott,  happened to be inside,  noticed us reading the stuff on the door and unlocked the door,  invited us in for a tour and taste of all their products.   We've been serious fans ever since.   I've had everything they make and all of their products are GREAT. My current favorite is 17, a bourbon,  but that is a limited run.    For Christmas, I got several people to go in for me and buy some 17 to give out as gifts.  I also bought their products available at participating liquor stores as gifts.  I distributed them to about 8 people total.  It was a mix of 17, Leanderthal Vodka, TexAgave, Triple Secession and Javagave.  Some recipients were serious liquor connisuer's,  others just liked a cocktail now and then.  All thoroughly enjoyed what they got and added it to their regular liquor rotations.  Leanderthal has since opened a tasting room where you can get cocktails made with all their products,  and are free to bring in outside food to munch on,  as they don't necessarily have food on site.  Although Scott has a creative work around with that by having a food truck occasionally.   They also give samples of all their products as well.   Their craft cocktails are GREAT!  And they are very affordable for top shelf cocktails.    If you like any type of liquor, Scott has a great version of it.  Everyone there are super friendly too.    Great place to go and hang out.   Only downside is you can only buy 2 bottles per adult every 30 days.   Awesome place!!"

Friends and I tried most of the menu between the four of us and every drink was great. Their liquors are unique and delicious. I love any drink that uses whole, natural ingredients- no mixers in this place, and who can beat $4-5 drinks that taste this good?!  Making it BYOFood is so great, I'm only worried that this spot will get so popular that it will outgrow its space. Can't wait to go back"

We drove up to a small manufactured building and the end of a street  with some questionable establishments nearby.  Just inside of the building is a simple bar and small seating area. The employees are friendly and offer us tastings. We try each of their three offerings: silver rum, Pecan Street Rum, and their whiskey. I can't say I have discerning taste when it comes to rum or whiskey but I enjoyed them.  We ordered three cocktails from their menu (drinks are $6 each or 3 for $15) and took them to their back seating area. It was very no frills and reminiscent of a garage or basement man cave, with old leather sofas and a dart board. The drinks were all really tasty and could definitely be dangerous. We saw that they included generous pours for the liquor yet we could barely taste the alcohol.  We only remained at the distillery for about a half hour because there wasn't much else to do there. No food and no outdoor seating.  Not a bad place to go if you want to grab a couple of drinks and patronize a local distillery but if they'd like to keep customers there longer, the owners will have to invest in helping create more of an experience."

It completely burries the whiskey. However, the coffee flavor is out of nowhere and sticks out like a soar thumb.  I had the Spirit of Texas Pfluger Single Malt Whiskey  3 star out of 5 stars Had it neat, they don't serve it in a  Glencairn so if you're a noser, bring your own. It's a much better mixer whiskey than it is neat in my opinion. However, I did get about a 3oz pour so... Booya! (The picture is after I drank about 3/4's of it, lol)  Also tried their \"famous\" Pecan street rum, not a big fan of rum but this was actually decent. Given the choice I wouldn't buy it for myself but I would drink it if offered.  The distillery itself was tiny with not many places to sit. Even their tasting room was mostly a few couches with only a few tables. With that said, it was quite cute and had quazi sports bar vibe.   The staff was friendly and very happy to let us sample and make suggestions based on our tastes.   Overall, I'd come back."

Ppl were grabbing the picnic tables and moving them over to the stage...like shouldn't mngmt have done that ahead of time?? As far as their whiskey and rum, we did not care for it at all. After the reviews, I guess I just expected more. We kept trying it in different types of drinks and it just tasted like cheap stuff. Not to mention their prices! We had exactly 6 mixed drinks. Our tab was $70 before tip. That's $11.50 a drink! Y'all, this place is backwoods Pfluggerville not the dang Domain! I pay $11-$13 for my drinks at the Domain. So, $11.50 for this place was ridiculous. We will definitely not be back. And if you see an advertisement for the comedy tour- skip it. The first comedian was not very good (he had a whole table walk out and leave during his performance. Ouch.), the 2nd was decent but not in any way worth a $70 bar tab."

When we were walking up the steps we noticed that there was an open sign lite up and when we walked in the bar tender said they have to close for an hour because he is the only one there and needs to help the band setup..... sounds like poor planning on the managements side. He said someone keeps changing their hours on Yelp but not sure about that hmm. Anyways he invited us back to see the show at 7 as they open back up for that, but was looking to have a drink and not be drowned out by a loud band. Maybe we will try your place again some time ....."

My wife's uncle dropped a bottle of single-malt whiskey on my counter and I decided to pour a neat glass after I poured 3 others for my guests. I really let this whiskey sit on the back of my tongue and savored the flavor. This is hands down the best whiskey I have ever had. I am more of a blended whiskey guy but the sweetness of this whiskey is absolutely perfect. I have my mixing whiskey, but this is definitely my sipping whiskey. There is definitely a strong vanilla taste going on with chocolate, but finishes hard with a good wood. Since having it, I am trying to find a way to get in there and pay my respects, but his review will have to do for now."

Grab an inside picnic table and enjoy the fresh air coming in through the open garage-style door. There is a oversized Connect Four game and cornhole for the kids to play. Plenty of fans mean the inside stays cool.   We tried the watermelon cucumber vodka drink, which was tasty. We also tried a classic cheese pizza and a pesto-sausage-olive pizza. Both were good, but could have used a little kick of flavor -- spice? Seasoning? Next time I would love to try the deep dish. Leave 30-45 mins for bake time."

Immediately when we came inside the tasting room we were met with a warm welcome. The menu here is deep and they have something for everyone here. Saturday's they have wood fired pizzas which we were told people come out here just for that. We will definitely be back for it!  We are in the middle of our tasting as I write this review and already I'm blown away by the Cabernet they have here. Beautiful and oaky; my first sip I just know I'm in trouble with this one! The Tempranillo has a wonderful nose to it and is nice and clean, easily could drink a bottle of this in a sitting. The Tannat was just lovely. Here are the stand outs though that we were pleasantly surprised with: Sweet Dreams, the port wine which is absolutely delicious and the Sparkling Muscadine (Sassy Mule) which is dangerously good! Fun fact, the Sparkling Muscadine is made with a local wild grape.  Amazing hospitality, zero pretentiousness, incredible wines, please visit this place!!! You're in for a real treat here."

Nice outdoor area with goats, donkeys and chickens and plenty of space for the kids to run around, but the whiskey and bourbon were very young and just didn't taste good. The women said the wine was average, but nothing amazing. The jalapeño margarita was good, but the Old Fashioned was the worst one I've ever had and couldn't drink more than half of it. 3 stars may even be stretching it, but since their local, I felt obligated. Truly a 2 star. ‍"

                "description": "A decent spot to stop and try a couple of the locally produced wines.  Another spot north of the Colorado that goes for the 'homey' approach to wine making and serving.  Pretty, family friendly atmosphere on the outside, with a photo-ready spot next to a life-sized fiberglass mule. (To my surprise the mule does not have a name yet.)   Inside, it looks like someone's house that's been converted to a tasting room.  That's a net plus, and there's a nice gift shop, but hopefully the management will get rid of the bright and ugly banks of fluorescent lights!  Service was fast, but the ladies behind the counter profess little knowledge about the wine and are surprisingly brusque, even while serving relatively few customers.  I've noticed this same critique from a couple other Yelp Reviews, making me wonder if this is just a personal style of theirs that's off-putting to some.  Regardless, it's oddly out of place in such a friendly area as Central Texas.  The wines are a mixed bag.  A chardonnay made from California grapes tastes surprisingly sharp and 'raw', but that may be the intent since it wasn't aged in oak.  The sweet blush is passable at best. However, the sparkling cranberry is excellent.  Worth a visit if you're in the area, but save room for the vastly superior Pillar Bluff and Pilot's Knob fare.  Some tips:  1) Watch for the turnoff from 183, it's pretty sharp and takes a downward jog!    2) The flights, which run $10 for 4 tastings, are half off on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  An excellent bargain all around."

The wood fire pizzas (I believe they only offer it on Saturday) were delicious, we had the brisket and pepperoni pizzas and it was the perfect amount to split between 4 people. Lovely gift shop, too! The wine is delicious and they have just about something for everyone including a stocked bar. Donkeys/mules and goats on the property are definitely a plus for the aesthetic. Will definitely be visiting often from now on!"

                "description": "We drive into Austin quite a bit on 183 and finally decided to stop in when it was not over 100 degrees.  Typical Texas winery decorations and gift shop, however \"Distillery\" was added to their location recently.    We gave the distillery a shot, or tasting.  Of the 5 we tasted, none were remarkable.  If you like that \"moonshine\" taste, this is for you.  They've tried to infuse maple and peach into a couple of their distilled spirits, stir clear of those.  The shop was okay, typical winery gag signs, towels, Pinterest type stuff.  Quiet a few people were there enjoying the weather, which leads to this: Get More Waitstaff when it's busy.  Two ladies selling gift trinkets and doing a full bar of tastings is S L O W.  We couldn't get the person doing our tasting to come back and acknowledge us, so we dropped cash on the bar and walked out."

                "description": "I came here for the first time over the weekend with some out-of-town guests. I did enjoy the bottle of wine I bought, but the employees were not very helpful. I don't know much about wine, so I asked them to pick out the closest wine to Pinot Noir as that's usually what I drink. Now I at least know the difference between white wine and red wine, and was surprised that their response was for me to order a white wine...  The ambience is decent, but they are limited on their indoor seating which is a shame because I'm sure more people would come and enjoy the live music."

                "description": "The only reason this winery deserves three stars in my book is because it is located semi-underground as it is built into the side of a cave.  You can get the feel of voyaging underground without having to pay an extortionist fee for this privilege. You will not be seeing the stalagmites and stalactites. Nor will you find a sleeping bat.  However, you can get a little buzzed and feel a lot of hometown love- although you might want to turn a blind eye (and ear) when they try to explain where their grape varietals are from, or when they try to up-sell you into their wine club.  Another neat feature is a glass-cased collection of old and unique wine openers. Think of this place as a grown-up quirky museum with a corkscrew twist and you will not be disappointed."

                "description": "This winery opened up last week in Liberty HIll. A mere 18 minute drive north of Cedar Park, Thirsty Mule is bringing the wine country closer to home. The owners are the same owners as the popular Georgetown winery.   The building once was a home that was built in 1979 and before Thirsty Mule Owners got a hold of it, it sat empty for many years. The tasting room which is backed up to a cave is on a nice plot of land which backs up to a creek. The completely remodeled the building and now has a long bar, several tables for enjoying a glass of wine and a banquet room that can accommodate about 50. Outside they have lots of picnic tables shaded by tall trees.   The wine portfolio is well rounded. Currently they have 2 whites, 4 reds, 4 sweets and a dessert wine. We ordered a flight each which runs $10 for 4 tastings (2 ounce pours). You can also purchase a glass of wine for $7 or buy  bottle to enjoy on the property or to take home. Between the two of us we tried the Pinot Blanc, Cabernet, Merlot, Malbec, sweet blush (strawberry) and the dessert wine which is called sweet mule. My four favorites were the Pinot Blanc, Malbec, and Cabernet. The Pinot Blanc was fruit forward at first but has a dry finish. The Malbec had some spice to it, we liked this one enough that we bought a bottle. The Cabernet had hints of bell pepper both on the nose and by taste. The blush makes for a good patio sipper but a tad sweet for my liking.   They plan to have live music soon and the patio is dog friendly. We had a great time meeting Scott during our tasting and enjoyed the tasting. If you stop in make sure to peak out the windows to get a glimpse of the limestone \"cave\" and the etched in date from the original owner."

                "description": "Pretty bad wine.  Nearly all of it.  I can't bring myself to go back.  I've gone to most of the pre-2007 wineries in Central Texas.  One star for the building.  The inside is really nicely laid out. One star for the impromptu musicians giving the patrons a nice selection of sounds.  Zero stars for the uneducated staff.  Seriously.....they rinsed my glass with water when going from white to red.  NoOOOOOOO!!!!  Don't do that!!!  I guess I didn't believe that after several reviews condemning that action, they still did it.  I would have protected my glass a little better.  Did a white or two.  Not good Did the Tempranillo.....not good.  Much better at any other winery I've tried. The 'ports' were like syrup.  Now, I know that Port is going to be on the sweeter side.  But when it pours practically like corn syrup, then I just can't do that much sweet.  Disappointed.  I had hoped that a winery closer to my house would be a fun getaway.  Not.  I WILL still buy the ports at the shop in downtown Georgetown, though.  Those are good."

                "description": "After passing this winery on Highway 183 several times, my husband finally surprised me with a spur of the moment decision to stop. I was very curious about a central Texas winery that offers a Malbec. I was not disappointed. It is a dark inky glass with a nice strong spice. The finish is long and jammy. It is not the best Malbec I've ever had, but for a local Texas winery, I am impressed. The Malbec is what convinced me to purchase the membership. The Cabernet did not disappoint either.   The grounds are lovely and the underground tasting room is nice when it's not shoulder to shoulder crowded. Most wonderfully, this winery is pet friendly and welcomed my Chihuahua with open arms and a savory dog treat. She liked it there as much as I did. They also offer a vast array of vinegar and olive oils. I have not tried them yet, but it is on my 2016 to do list.   When I am craving a weekend in Fredricksburg, but can't get away, the Thirsty Mule Winery is the perfect way to spend a Saturday."

It is by far the best wine I have ever had. The scenery around the winery is beautiful, the staff is super friendly, and the wine is incredible and delicious. They have types of wine from the dry reds to some sweet white and there \"sweet dreams\" wine is to die for! Everything is reasonable priced and has impeccable quality. I have to say if you are looking for a beautiful place to hangout and drink some great wine. You have to check this place out and inquire about there wine club it is SO worth it."

Once we were done floating, the bus conveniently picked us up at the exit of the river. I would highly recommend Thunderdome for big group parties."

                "description": "This review is long overdue.  I booked the Thunderdome Party Bus for a bachelor party back in May 2017.  The bus was perfect!! Seated our group of 15 comfortably.  The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

She was friendly and very informative.  She helped make the experience exactly what I was looking for. I wanted less sweet wines and a winery with food options. Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time.

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

We have had many fun events on the Big Blue Bus (UT games, holiday and birthday parties) and Robert always comes away with new clients. I highly recommend Austin Nites for any event that requires transporting a group. The bus ride will be the best part of your event!"

From booking the ride up until the end of the night everything went as planned.  Our driver, Jared, was professional and so great to the girls and I during the time he drove us around.  The owners, Robert and Melissa, promptly returned my calls/texts with any questions I had before the night of the booking. The fee for the evening was wonderfully priced compared to other companies I had called around and gotten quotes from.  I highly recommend Austin Nites Party Bus based on my experience with them."

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

I passed on getting a flight b/c of the wine guy. I got a glass of a red blend to go so I could shop around the square. The wine was fantastic.

Tom provided a charming mixture of highbrow wine knowledge and light humor as he took us through our tasting journey of 5 red wines. The wife liked all of the wines, and I liked all but one (a tempranillo). Never fear! Tom is here! Tom saved the day (and the Tres Primos reputation) by pouring us an extra taste, but instructing us to first chew a chocolate-covered coffee bean before pouring the wine across that bean in our mouths. This somehow transformed the flavour into something amazingly pleasing for us both!  We also ordered chicken empanadas, which were surprisingly delicious! For some reason we did not expect such flavor and complexity from a wine bar's kitchen. The empanada crust was crispy and flaky, with a filling of chopped chicken, onions and seasonings that burst into the mouth with each bite. This was no Tex-Mex kitchen empanada. Hats off Barons! Hats off!"

Barons had more of an uppity vibe to it, so maybe I wasn't picking up what they were putting down from the jump as I tend gravitate toward a more casual atmosphere... especially when it comes to wine tasting.   They were nice and helpful here and poured us a cup of Tempranillo and Crazy Train on our way out, to drink while we walked around the square. Both good wines but did not justify the price tag for us."

                "description": "Conveniently located on the Georgetown Square, Grape Creek Vineyards tasting room is a welcoming oasis of great wines and friendly \"tasting ambassadors\". You know Grape Creek's wine is good: they earned almost 2 dozen medals, including three Double Golds, this year at the prestigious San Francisco Wine Competition. And their wins encompass all styles, with Double Gold wins for red, white and Port. My Tasting Ambassador, Sandy, was exceptional! As we talked, she discerned my tastes and made a couple of recommendations that turned out to be spot on. She was knowledgeable and responsive, and a delight to talk with. Having been to many tasting rooms and wineries in the Texas Hill Country as well as from the California wine regions to the New York Finger Lakes, my experience at Grape Creek exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"

                "description": "These guys are extremely rude. We all purchased memberships and wanted to enjoy our wine on the patio which was mostly empty. Since they made us split up our party of six we got two tables that were close together. Apparently management had a problem with my girlfriend and I orienting our chairs towards our friends table so we could all talk to each other and came and got in our faces to tell us we have to turn our chairs around and face forward. What is this kindergarten? The wine was alright, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 per bottle price tag. I've found better bottles at HEB for under $20. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other wineries in the area of the same quality that are more affordable and less rude"

It is absolutely delish and my go to red for my collection and for gifting to friends.   While the main building itself is somewhat small and doesnt offer the option to sit downstairs (GC....this is overdue), there is a members only room available upstaird with views of the Gtown Square.  The patio however is the reason people gravitate towards this winery. There is live music, nice fans to keep you cool in summer and heaters for the winter.  My only dislike is the changes hours...it closes at 6:30. Far too early and down the street are alternatives that stay open til 9 or later."

My friend is a wine club member and invited us to accompany her and her significant other to a tasting. We ended up enjoying a bottle! It was delicious. We sat in the reserved section on the second floor and finished the bottle and relaxed. Grape Creek has a nice selection of local wines to choose. Although the facility is small, the atmosphere is friendly and quaint."

Although... standing in line when you first walk-in did seem a bit off, it was merely just a way to help usher traffic through more efficiently. Luckily, the line went quickly or this would probably be a different type of review, as someone * wink wink* who doesn't do well with lines for absolutely anything, except that one Prince concert 30 years ago.   Needless to say, we came, we tasted, we joined the wine club and now we are big fans. Especially of their Rose of Malbec. That deliciously tasting watermelon jolly rancher (without the sugar) wine has changed wine drinking for me and completely justifies the $30 price tag."

She started jerking things away from the table while we were still sitting there. We had previously been sitting there calmly, not being loud or offensive in any way - it felt very abrupt and extremely rude. We realized after we were booted out that closing was at 5 and this intrusion happened at 5:10, it wasn't like they were waiting on us for an hour.

I decided to join the wine club because of her level of service. However, it's hard to get a hold of someone on the phone. I have a simple question to ask but no one will ever pick up the phone. When select the button to speak to the tasting room, their automated service starts all over again. Yes, I can email, but for a simple question, picking up the phone should be an easy option as well.  Also, the times on yelp versus their times on the phone are inconsistent. That needs to be updated.  Bottomline, they lack communication.  It's really annoying and frustrating. I plan on canceling my wine club membership and going elsewhere due to the experience that I've had."

I really like this winery, with the exclusive access to seating upstairs. I love the live entertainment outside lounge area. I really like this winery! I also like how EVERY time you come to the winery, you get a complimentary glass of wine! Of course, you need a membership.  I don't live in the area so I have a trek to make to receive my complimentary glass of wine for me and a guest. However, when I am in the area you better believe I am here. I just started my membership last visit but failed to write a review after a couple of bottles. My apologies. I was informed that my three bottles qill be mailed to my residence in Harker Heights, Texas. I will be sure to post how that goes. You can cancel the membership at anytime. More to follow after I really get a chance to experience this establishment."

My sorority sisters came to Georgetown for Austin's ACL Fest and added on extra days to sightsee.   Grape Creek was a wonderful respite.  You stand in line, describe your likes to the salesperson, and taste. Then, you get wine by the glass (I think it was 10$/glass) to enjoy on their relaxing patio, and bottles to go.   My BF is a frequent member and has a card to get 2 free glasses of wine a month.   A very nice spot to relax and enjoy good wine and good conversation.   Thank you Grape Creek Vineyards!"

It's going to be a quarterly experience for my wife and I, which includes a 6-sample tasting or half glass each visit and access to the upstairs member only area. We went on a Saturday around 5:00 and it was busy! The wait for the tasting was only a few minutes since they fully staffed the counter. I think I saw them doing 5 couples or groups at a time.  She told us that we can order delivery from Gumbo's around the corner or bring in any food that we want! The offer live music on the weekends on the patio and dogs are welcome out there. The member only area was packed with people, so it was a bit hot, but had comfortable couches and chairs, many windows overlooking the courthouse and town square, and some salespeople offering tastes of the Owner's Club wines. I only took off a star because the member's area was hot and could use some more seating and a server would be great since it takes a while to get another glass or make a purchase by standing in line more than once.  The had quite a bit of wine related merchandise, cheese, olive oils and vinegars, and cookbooks downstairs."

It is a nice storefront on the square in Georgetown, which is a terribly cute area if you haven't been.  Got my free member glass and took it out on the back patio to enjoy.  Plenty of tables and shade there and some light classic rock, which made for a nice relaxing atmosphere.  Also I went upstairs to check out the members only lounge.  There was nothing free being handed out there food or sipping wise, but it was a comfortable place with lots of leather chairs, and if the winery was crowded, I could see escaping up here.  The wine itself is very good, something for every palate, even the dry red drinkers like myself.  If you are into wine at all, stop by and do a tasting, and I think you will be happy you did.  I plan to come back anytime I'm in the Georgetown area again."

People everywhere with no special lines for members Or any direction other than a sign that said everyone get in line.  Not sure the value of paying to be a member for this space.  Also a 21 and over rule in the tasting room. Most serious wine folks have kids.  Seriously reconsidering our membership and if it's with it. My suggestion would be to expand as quick as possible if you're that popular. Otherwise, do away with memberships benefits and just open to the public.  4 stars because the wine is amazing."

The staff checked in on us as we tasted our way thru the wines. When we finished tasting, we bought a glass of our fave wine and continued to walk through market days on the square.  Anywho, if your walking the Georgetown Square, stop in for a tasting and or a glass or 2. Cheers."

After a more upscale experience in a different tasting room on the square, it was pleasant to ease into this more relaxed space. We were promptly greeted by the hostess, who became our server, and perused the menu of wines. $10 each for a sampling of 4 wines. Nice price, and fitting to the setting which would have been appropriate for beer as well. Neither of us remembers which wines we ordered, except for my two port samplings, but neither of us was overly impressed either. My ports were good, if extremely sweet and fruity, and the wife liked 2 of hers. She was disappointed in her first choice, which was the most expensive wine on the menu as priced by the bottle.  We didn't buy a bottle, nor would we return if we ever visit Georgetown again, but the ambience and carefree environment did add to an overall relaxing day on the square."

This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, or just an afternoon with a small group of friends or family. The actual vineyard is located in Rockdale Texas- this is just a small tasting room right on the Georgetown Square.   For $10, you can taste 4 wines. My spouse also got 4 tasting, so in total- I got to sample 8 wines. My favorite was the Big Tex which is aged for 9 months in oak. A full bottle will set you back only $24. Create price for the quality.  I also love their Viognier, I love white wines- and this was so light. I would casually sip this on any warm summer day. One thing I didn't love their fruity wines. The Blueberry and Blackberry wines tasted like they used artificial flavoring. The couple next to use was absolutely loving the blackberry, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Totally fair.   They also have cheese and crackers available. I feel like any wine tasting isn't complete without a good cheese plate. Unfortunately, we had dinner plans right after, so I enjoyed my wine cheese-free.   I absolutely plan on coming back here soon for some wine + cheese."

We are wine club members and LOVE this place ($50 per quarter gets you 2 tastings, 6 full glasses, and 2 whole bottles of wine). The perfect spot to enjoy some quality wine and some quality time with friends and family. We always bring cards or a board game and have a blast."

We had to ask all the questions about the winery and their response was short and curt. We we the only people in the winery and yet they felt as if it was an inconvenience to talk to us. Will not return. Will continue to visit  the other Georgetown in South Carolina where people are more welcoming to all."

My friends and I have only been members of this winery for about a year, but this is honestly one of our favorite locations to consistently come and visit when we're all together. They have sweeter drinks and wineritas for people who aren't fond of dry wines and their wine club memberships are literally built to be shared. There is table seating inside where you can sit for hours and catch up. Laurie and Heather in particular are so sweet with their service and their recommendations. I can't think of where else I would rather spend my weekend."

My partner liked two of the reds so much she bought a bottle of each.  This is a long narrow shop that has lots of knick-knack items displayed so we did not move around much, but it was fun to read all the funny quotes on the signs and towels and glasses, etc. The folks at the bar were helpful and friendly, and we enjoyed this visit much more than our first."

Any day of the week. And I know from experience.   I don't bother doing the tastings here - I know exactly what I like. Their unoaked chardonnay is butter and smooth. After that I move over to their pinot noir - which isn't too sweet but not so dry that I need to carry in my own water bottle. I do not drink fruit wines but my sweet lil granny does and she swears by the pomegranate and blueberry.   You can buy gifts and chochskies here. I always like to pick up a few bottles of wine before I had home to visit family. Their wine club is probably the best you can be apart of in terms of benefits.   I would really like if they would provide bread so that we can try the olive oils. Probably smart that they don't do that or else all of us winos would use that as food. :)"

Never knew anything about Georgetown except that it was an annoying mile marker on Interstate Hell-35 indicating after driving north for an hour you have gone nowhere.  Low and behold there is actually an ancient town square buried in there somewhere. So what else to do but gravitate like a bee to flower and find the alcohol. It's here and it's called wine.  The place is filled full on a steamy June Saturday afternoon. Saddle up to the bar and start in on the tasting. I was in a red mood and took 4 tastes.  The chambourcin was an interesting new grape for me and it was deeply dark in color yet light on the tannins. It was nice but I like tannin and the Tempranillo delivered on all counts.  It was a nice pit stop and I recommend it if you accidentally end up touring the square of Georgetown."

                "description": "My family rode the North Pole Flyer, not so much for the Santa stuff since we have no children under 10, it was more for family fun. And it was a fantastic experience. The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

Dirty cars, dirty seats, dirty windows with bleak scenery outside and Santa who gives a broken whistle. That is all for 2 hours trip. Even an obsessed with trains 4 years old was bored.  If you decide to go don't forget to take a mask or a respirator, it's hard to breathe inside because of dust."

                "description": "We had a great time on the Beer Train last night that was advertised as a sunset tour that was 2.5 hours long.  Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

                "description": "My husband and I went on the Hill Country Flyer for our anniversary weekend and we were in the \"Rippling Stream\" train car. The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

                "description": "This was an excellent experience. We took the train from Bertram to Burnet for one of the special events (Wedding Oaks wine trip). The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

Super We stayed in the Turquoise Room, which consisted of 2 tables, 8 chairs and two smaller windows. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable...Once the train started the conductor came in to room to announce that there we several open seats in the main car...everyone got up and left leaving the wife and I in peace...Not that we are anti social, but it was peaceful to say the least...Good to catch up with each other, as we both work different hours...Truly not much to see on the way up...but it was a great ride....AC did work, not great but tolerable...I see in other reviews there were issues...You have freedom to roam Car to Car once the train gets rolling...and the train does turn around in Burnet...hard to explain, but it does...and we were able to see the other side of the tracks on the way home...Plenty to see and eat in Burnet...Our Car/cabin also came with free snacks and drinks...which is a great perk..as the snacks in the concession stand were quit expensive...The trip was worth it for us and will do it again next year with the granddaughter.."

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "It's such an adorable idea - volunteers running a historic train line on weekends to give people an authentic experience. But the train is slow - really really slow. The view is simple and unmemorable. The FandB in the first class is simply a cinnamon roll and lemon cake with tea. They do have apples and oranges as well. The trip back was painful - we stood in the concession cart the entire time because the A/Cs didn't work and it was triple-digit hot on a September Saturday. Even my 5-year-old nephew, who is obsessed with trains and knows all there is to know about them, wasn't engaged in this ride much. Thankfully, we had carried board games and our own food so the ride to Burnet was okay but the ride back was really terrible."

                "description": "The most horrible rip off of an experience I have ever had. I bought 4 tickets for the VIP lounge which included treats and drinks and a nicer car, it was none of those things. The food offered were store bought generic cookies and the drinks were either warm apple juice or water. The car lost the A.C. capacity on the return from the small town with nothing to offer and did not even have the gun fight reenactment due to the extreme heat, now imagine that extreme heat inside a metal sardine box. I invited my 72 year old father and I was genuinely worried we would have to rush him to the emergency room upon arrival. I chewed the place out for their false advertisement and putting the elderly and children at risk in the extreme heat without AC.   In summation, do not buy tickets to any of the events this was a horrible experience. I got my money almost a month later, and I will never return and I will warn anyone thinking about ever going to one of these fiascos."

We booked tickets on the Sunset Express trip. The Staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable.   You are able to bring your own drinks (non alcoholic) and snacks which is a plus. They do have a concessions car which is nice.   To us the trip was not as much about the scenery as it was the experience of a mode of travel long since gone."

Just jump off the train, and there you are.  Each train car has it's own characteristics, but take my word, spend the extra money for the air conditioned cars.  We had a chance to walk through the other cars, and even on a beautiful spring day, you can tell a big difference walking into the cars without A/C.  We rode on the City of Chicago, in a table for two, which had great views.  There was complimentary water, tea and snacks on our car.  The volunteer, Barbara, was informative about the train, wildflowers, and announced points of interest on the route."

                "description": "My family and I took a ride on the Hill Country Flyer and this a brief overview of our experience and I recommend you heed this review well.  ----------------------------  I visited and rode the September 7th 10:00 am to 5:00 pm ride to Burnett going out of Cedar Park Wirth the Austin Steam Train Association and I'd like to share my experience that day.   To begin the train left 20 minutes late from the terminal when it was communicated the train would be leaving promptly and on time consistently. Which is fine although it did negatively impact the quality of time spent in Burnett and exploring the town which was a key experience in the advertised outing. Another large disappointment was the lack of the advertised western gun fight. We saw no mention of it, nor display of it. Apparently that was another misrepresentation of the trip. It was advertised we would have two hours to explore downtown Burnett and have lunch. This was barely enough time to visit a local restaurant flooding with business from both local lunchtime and other passengers. With barely an hour in Burnett without enough time to eat we actually had to leave the restaurant we were at in a manic frenzy without eating, apologize to the staff at the restaurant for our rush due to this,and return to the train. Then upon returning at the specified time we still not even begin the process of departing until nearly 30 minutes past the time we were told to return! The. On the return trip we didn't even get above 10 mph on the speed making for a grueling and arduous journey back creating an atmosphere on complete misery on the entire train. On top of all of that the trains expected time to return was 5:00 we did not return until after 5:30! This is insane it officially help derail our entire vacation plan and helped out more of a strain on our time off. Meaning we had to rush and adjust our original plans.   Another issue with the experience was there little to no a/c in rear car named Rippling Stream on a day with temperatures rising above 95 degrees! Although the next car over had perfect a/c with a lower priced ticket. Paying for six tickets @55 dollars to sit in the heat in pool of our own sweat was not the idea of a luxury car provided by marketing materials. We actually had to use the pamphlets provided to make fans in order to be comfortable during the ride and continuously go into the other cars for refuge from the sweltering heat. Upon informing staff of the issue we were told once the train is moving we can go to other cars and stand in the cool air to gain some reprise from the heat.This is insane as we bought out the entire private room to have a bonding family experience we certainly were unable to enjoy. Also this car represented itself as a purchase of an adults only car ticket and children were running through the car. We wanted an experience that would supply with a relaxing adult atmosphere that was negatively impacted by this not being enforced.   Another major concern of mine is lack of communication from staff with the private areas of the train. Announcements regarding safety, departure time, arrival, landmarks etc were unheard in the private room and no effort was made by train personnel to inform us of anything. We were left alone with no information about anything given without having to seek out an attendant regularly. To mention with sound there was also an almost constant excessively loud screeching noise as we moved along at a slugs pace that I feel each passenger will hear in their nightmares of this ride for years to come.   This experience wound up being more stressful due to the previously mentioned circumstances causing our trip to be unenjoyable. Due to the dishonest representation of a truly climate controlled car, and times for departure misrepresented. Unfortunately this is not an outing that we would attended again or recommend to others visiting the Austin/Hill Country area. This is not something we would recommend for anyone trying to relax or enjoy a vacation."

I am a Red Raider  This is was our first trip out and loved it!  The beers were delicious.  I had the IPA, the double IPA, and the Amber.  Wife had the blonde and the Hefe.    My favorite was the IPA then the Hefe and then the Double.  Can't wait to go back and try more.  I missed the details on the mug club,  but like the concept and will have to check it out.  A little far from my house so not sure if the bang is worth the buck based on my frequency.  The atmosphere was fantastic.  Great patio and open space areas.  There was a Youngman playing cover music but there was enough space to where he didn't seem loud.  There was plenty of games and we brought some toys and our kid and others had a blast running around.  It was beautiful and spacious, yet plenty of space inside for when it it gets to crazy Texas temps in the summer.  Only bummer was the food truck was broke down so we just ordered Dominos instead! How easy is that?!  Looking forward to the next visit and recommend you check it out too"

Plus one had her usual lite Blonde ale and she was OK with it. She was not thrilled with the crisp finish but she did empty her pint. There is a cozy bar area with TVs and with the Temps reaching 100 degrees we chilled out there. There is also a nice beer garden with fans on the deck but even with the abundance of shade trees, it was too darn hot to be outside.  Lastly, the bartenders are pleasant and knowledgeable and will provide excellent guidance if you are a newbie. They do have some interesting specialty/seasonal beers that I must go back and try.

                "description": "Beer and board games are the catch here . Our bartender was knowledgeable and helpful with selecting beer choices. Especially since I'm not the biggest \"craft-beer drinker\" he suggested the blonde which was just what I was looking for.  My friends had the doublerumtoberfest and rate it 10/10!!  I love the open concept that makes the space seem larger than it is. We came at 1pm on A Saturday, not too many people just A few family's enjoying their day. Their patio area looks super cozy but it's too cold today so I'll be back!"

When you are going to have a dog friendly place then the establishment should make sure that dog poop is not laying around.  We went there when it opened on a Wednesday at 4 pm and when we went to sit down there were 3 Piles of dog poop and the flies were terrible."

                "description": "I was recently in Georgetown for the 20th Anniversary Annual Meeting of the Texas Master Naturalists. I stayed in my camper at Cedar Breaks and commuted daily to the conference at the Sheraton. I was at the Sheraton from dark to dark attending classes every day but the last. The conference ended at noon, and I headed straight to Rentsch.  I got a flight of beers and went outside to drink them. I was the only one there for the first twenty minutes or so. That gave me the freedom to move around from place to place. The outside area is really nice. I tried full sun areas and shaded areas. There were several bees in the area that pestered me, adding to my moves. The wind chimes were also a nice touch.  I liked all of the beers I tried. But two of them were amazing. They were the Bourbon Barrel Double Oktoberfest (2017) and the Double Rumtoberfest. Believe me, if I weren't alone and responsible for my own transportation back to camp, I would have stayed and had a few more Rumtoberfests. It was everything I like in a craft beer.  Georgetown was such a great to visit. I know I will be back to camp at Cedar Breaks. That obviously means that I will be back to the brewery. I only hope they have another beer as awesome as the Oktoberfest and Rumtoberfest. I am sure they are seasonal, and probably won't be on tap next time."

Had to buy a 6pk to go just to enjoy the standard options. Not very personable staff either, but I guess that's just the covid design of grab a beer and gtfo of the building haha"

Service is five stars Atmosphere is five stars + a happy dog paw for being dog-friendly Cleanliness is five stars Selection is 4.5 stars but that's probably on me...  I am a picky beer drinker so I didn't quite find one I liked this time, but the flight and tasting options are great so I'm sure I'll get there eventually. Just need to try some more beer!   They had a food truck on the day we went, with giant tacos and nachos, which made for a perfect Sunday Funday with my partner. Can't wait to do it again."

The Meridian Hive Blackberry Mead was my favorite, but the other three choices in the flight including Hefeweizen, Strawberry Limeade Ale, and Magonada with a tajin rim were delicious as well! The seating area was comfortable and well shaded. The on-site food truck served up an amazing chipotle steak quesadilla; it had the right blend of savory and spice. Together, the beverages at BA and the lineup at the food truck were a great pairing! We are on vacation here in Texas and we're hoping to return to the Barking Armadillo before we head home!"

Husband had the Witbier (one of his go to styles) and I had the Hefe and (limited) strawberry farmadillo.  We ordered chips and queso and tacos from the taco truck onsite. We enjoyed those as well. Very solid meat in those tacos and very filling!  We will return, but try to come earlier so we can sit on the patio instead of inside. Some of the guests inside were not vigilant about masking when leaving their table. I would suggest some signage on the interior tables (at least) reminding them of this request.  There are dogs allowed inside which did not bother us at all (we have 2 at home). But, some people are not as comfortable with dogs inside so I feel it needs to be mentioned.  Looking forward to trying more beers in the future!"

There is nice shaded outdoor seating. Inside has a few video games and pinball. There is plenty of seating insight with high tops and tables. There is a nice couch and a couple of comfy chairs.   The bartenders are great. The beer selection changes with a handful or regular lagers and IPAs. The stout is coffee based. The Belgian heavy is fantastic, better than Devil's Backbone. Prices are fair. People might argue about the single kind of glassware, but I'm unbothered.  Would be good to have a few more interesting board games their for more of a social atmosphere, but hard to argue with success."

I think it's really cool that they have merchandise and a fully running bar and restaurant in the same space. I felt it was very cozy and interesting aesthetically with all of the taxidermy on the walls. I really enjoyed grabbing a drink here with a friend and I would definitely come back to shop or drink in the future."

It's perfect because my wife and I will grab two beers to go, drop a tip, and walk the square/walking trail up the street to get our steps in on our Fitbit. It's always exciting because the beers change daily to weekly. We've hung out inside on occasion which is perfect for card games and relaxing. The apparel for sale is typical of a REI/Bass Pro Shop. Expensive but quality.   Bar: rotating beer, wine, white claws  Bonus: Very dog friendly! And one of the only places open late."

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and the taps are rotating. They even have water bowls outside for your dog. They serve beer, wine, and select seltzer's in cans. It's a great place to kill a few hours in the heart of downtown Georgetown."

Luckily there are a few outdoor tables and chairs for overflow but even the sidewalks get crowded with people just standing around drinking. One evening we managed to make it in and see what all the excitement was about and it's a cute little beer and wine bar/outdoors gear store. Cute merchandise but pretty pricey. The bartender told us occasionally a food truck will park behind their store so you can enjoy yummy eats with your drinks, otherwise no food menu. I liked the atmosphere of this place... cute little date night drink spot on the square. But I am a little confused by why it's so crowded all the time. The beer and wine list is good, but not anything spectacular. I don't get it. I'm sure we'll be back at some point if we can find a place to sit."

They have a good selection of draft beer that changes from time to time. Mostly local. I went back the very next day for the Dallas Cowboys game. Very friendly staff. The next day I sat in a comfortable leather chair. They also have a lot of nice clothing for men. A little too pricey for me, but I understand they have some deals from time to time. I will definitely be going there every time I'm in downtown Georgetown."

I didn't try the beer, so I can't comment on that, but the clothing selection was good. They carry Howler Brothers apparel, which is a company out of Austin that my fisherman husband likes, and Texas Standard clothing, which is a TX-based brand with cool (not kitschy) Texas-themed clothing that gives back to Texas non-profs. They also carry another local brand - Kermode Outdoors - which is new to me, but evidently founded by Georgetown residents. The store has a great vibe and the bar is a place I could see spending a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Stores like this are what I look for whenever I shop local - a place that sells unique, cool stuff that someone has spent time thinking about.   4 not 5 stars because I didn't try the beer. Next time...."

Good pizza and a great selection of draft beer is why we stop. But tonight, Sunday evening, January 2, was a disappointment. We agreed to the 30 minute wait that we were told it would take for our group of five to be seated. What we were not told after we were seated was that we would have to wait more than an hour to receive our two-pizza order. An hour and twenty minutes to be exact. It seemed a great number of take-out orders were being filled that night and after an hour our waiter assured us our order had not been lost but there was a long line ahead of us. The staff knew of the pending delay when we were seated and we should have been informed so we could decide if we wanted to invent that amount of time. The bill was $88 and some change. I left a $5 tip and a note expressing my disappointment. I signed my name and left my phone number on the ticket should the owners like a more detailed explanation of our experience. We will go back to 600 Degrees but we know now to ask what the wait time will be after we are seated."

I thought about a nearby place that has a great beer selection and pizza.  So, I went there.  But I went in a different direction. Hot wings.  I asked about them.  The servers were attentive and described everything.  Even the bartender came over to check and make sure I was OK after I ordered and suggested beers and said it will be worth the wait.    Then the wings came to my table. They glistened in sauce and fat and were luscious.  Even the shiny foil underneath made them look like a gift   And then I ate.    Tender, juicy, the perfect spice.  The heat and meat!  Sooo good!!  The perfect chili/orange/Buffalo sauce color was gorgeous but tasted even better.  My palate was singing! My hands were messy. But, I ignored napkins, my friends!  I licked my fingers instead.  I don't regret it!   I thought at first the size of the wings order would be too much. It. Was. Not.   The server asked if I wanted a pizza. But, no, I ordered another beer and wings.  I don't want the pizza. I want the wings!!!!"

They should have some outdoor heaters and covering from the on/off drizzle.  We ordered a pizza and wings. The pizza names were curious as I'm from the area these towns are located in. I ordered my birthplace pizza (San Jose). The Lemmon pepper wings came out about 20 minutes before the pizza. The wings were PERFECT! I mean damn they were good! The pizza came out and it's a spicy one. The pizza was bigger than I expected and is made for at least two people. Flavor was good but it had a bit too much of some sort of creamy white sauce on top. The beers were on point as I tried out several local ones.  I will definitely come back and try more of their delicious menu!"

Think as large a slice that you have to fold like a sandwich to eat. Perfect for any pizza or cheese cravings.   Atmosphere: Had the chance to dine outside of here. Given the location within Georgetown, you get the feeling of a family pizzeria. A place one would bring their friends for a casual dine out. Complete with patio.  Food: As mentioned above, big big slices. Perfect for any pizza lover of all sorts. I ended up going with the Pirate which is one of their speciality slices that comes as pictured below with a pickle too. The only complaint I'd have is that since the pizza's come out so fresh they also come out very hot. I unashamedly had to eat the pizza with a knife and fork as I just couldn't wait for such a prize to just sit there.   Service: Friendly service, given the significant amount of speciality slices I had a few questions and the server was happily able to answer any I had. Especially if you are unsure of what pizza slice you may want.  Overall: Now that I've tasted whenever I have pizza cravings I just want to return here to try all their other speciality slices. Give this place a try, and have a slice day!"

You can do pizza by the slice and customize it with your own toppings much like a whole pizza except it's a slice, a slice that is the size of a small pizza or Texas? Go figure.   Everything is bigger.   Just cheese pizza would be rather bland here add your toppings and go with it.  Everyone gets what they want and it's fast.   Good stuff.  The garlic knots need some more garlic too them that's just me.   Definite unique spot to get that pizza fix."

We popped in to 600 degrees after talking about needing to try it for months and it did NOT disappoint.  We were going to try a traditional pie, but ended up branching out to try the Royale with Cheese and we are so glad we did! The pizza was incredible, we split it and still had a few slices left over. We did it with the additional mustard and pickles, which is an absolute must.  The crust was to die for, and I say this as a person who normally throws crust away. It was so fluffy and soft, truly a 10/10 dough experience.  They had Maine Root soda on the fountain and a ton of beers on tap that they are more than willing to let you sample.   It isn't a big place and it can get pretty packed. There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived, but we ended up just sitting at the bar.  The service was great, the food was phenomenal, and the atmosphere was fun and friendly."

                "description": "Tried out for a later lunch/early dinner so got here about 330.  (Passing through to San Antonio but was starving)   It's in downtown/on the square so has the old build vibe. The side we sat on was little and faced the bar.   Definitely has the college town feel.   ***Didn't see any actual menus so be prepared to use your camera on your phone to look at the menu.   Service: Food was slow to come out. I didn't time it but we were there about an hour.  Our waitress was nice and did come by and check on us a couple times.   Food: Ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was tasty. The size for the salad was big enough you could share if you are looking for a smaller side salad.   I will say if the time it took to get our slices it was worth no sharing.  We ordered #6 pirate and #23 number 23 as slices and shared them.  Oh my!! They were both delicious and honestly for us worth the wait.   Even with the little bit of the wait I think still worth the 5 stars.   ** please forgive my pictures, I got so excited about them I ate the point of the slices. And we sliced them in half after we got them so they would be entire piece if when you get them.    ENJOY"

The slices are very big and one was plenty, hand in pic for reference of size. We didn't try any of the craft beers but their selection is quite large if that's your thing. Easy to find parking and a nice chill vibe."

                "description": "I have always loved coming here. Service is hit or miss but such is life. I've told so many people about this place because they have a decent beer selection and decent pizza.   I'm a simple girl. I love a hoppy beer and a slice of cheese pizza, so that's generally what I come here for.  I'm always respectful, nice, I tip well and have a cheerful disposition. That's just my vibe. I've also been a server for many many years so I'm generally pretty patient with bad/moody service or off experiences.  I loved this place so much that I used to always go to the one in N. Austin slash Cedar park for lunch because it was close to my work and I'm a loyal customer. At that location, I always order a slice of cheese pizza. One time I asked for a bit of seasoning, chef's choice, and it was so damn good I never ordered regular cheese pizza again. It's a beautiful thing and I was so thankful.  I can drink a beer and make something tasty at home; all day every day, but tonight I decided to come to 600 degrees because I love supporting local businesses and servers in general.   I order my go to; the hoppiest beer and a slice of cheese pizza with any seasoning.   She said \"we only offer cheese pizza or pepperoni\"  I was like, \"cool, I just want a slice of cheese pizza but with a touch of seasoning, any seasoning really, chef's choice.\"  She appears to be really put out, not the least bit subtle and perhaps internalizing this because she's outwardly angry. \"I can give you Parmesan or red peppers as seasoning.\" She picks up both and throws them like I've hit a nerve.   Sips beer. Ok, fine, whatever. ‍   It's a slow Sunday night, there's 3 other people at the bar. It's approx 8:30pm and apparently seasoning is a touchy subject around here so I let it go for now, but the fear of my slice lacking flavor was making me rethink my dinner choices. I hadn't had a proper meal all day, just scraps of snacky stuff. I was really hungry, but not so hungry I would eat something just shy of delicious.   I take a few sips of my beer and the bad vibes are so thick I could cut right through them.  Being steps away from the BOH, I ask, \"hey can I get a little bit of seasoning on my slice of cheese pizza?\"  To which he responds; \"you have to ask your server. Its up to them, if they order it I'll make it. I can't make it if they don't order it\". The loyalty coupled with toxicity was blowing my mind.   Apparently it's a whole thing, because the staff starts gathering to watch the showdown. Girl who wants a slice of seasoned cheese pizza against the world. It's riveting.   OMG you guys, this woman wants seasoning!!! Can you believe it!!!?   It's to a point that it's kinda hilarious and I'm just like, these people have big feelings about seasoning.   She steps in, heroically in her eyes I'm sure and says \"I'll do it for you but just this one time.\" I mean, total saint right?   Oh my! I'm touched. Thank you! My cup runneth over!   I go back to my seat and watch the drama unfold over a bit of seasoning on a slice of cheese pizza. It's something to behold folks.   At this point I don't like my tasty beer so much that I'm willing to subject myself to this level of toxicity so I left because I prefer my pizza sans the needless drama and hostility.   I kinda think this has nothing to do with seasoning."

I upped the rating to 5 star from 3 star because takeout pizza is all about timing. 600 has taken steps to separate the \"I just want a beer\" line from the \"hey, I'm here to pick up an order\" line. Getting home with a hot pizza = a great pizza. Getting stuck in a long checkout line and ending up with a cold pizza = a horrible pizza.   Great job 600 on stepping up and making the takeout experience better for all."

Their pizza was made-to-order, and their staff is friendly and communicative.   Let me tell ya...it was the best pizza I've had in Texas.  My wife loved it so much she told me to hide it from her :)  So good.  Next time I get pizza, I might just drive all the way to Georgetown just to get it.  So good."

They do have a local market around the corner that offers Togo only.   If they don't have a pizza you like you Dan make your own. They also offer wings, knots and salads. Honestly you cannot go wrong and it's all locally owned."

                "description": "We came to this place on a Saturday night and it was busy. We put our name on the list and were told it was a 50 minute wait. We walked around the quaint shops of the square while we waited. When it was our turn, we were really hungry! Our friendly  server was Michael and he was really friendly. He brought us a few samples of local beer and my husband and I were happy to get to choose our favorites. I can't remember what we got but it was good. We ordered garlic knots but they were out. We choose cheesy bread for our 2nd choice appetizer. We ordered one city pie, one margarita pizza, and one cheese pizza. Michael recommended the gluten free, which made our portions a little smaller and also less of that bloated feeling. The hubby and I are trying to eat healthier so I said yes to gluten free. We ate almost all of our pizzas, while sitting on the patio enjoying our beer.  This restaurant is just one more reason that I'm falling in love with Georgetown. We will be back."

                "description": "Stopped by for lunch on a gloomy Saturday and surprised that the wait time was relatively short for a packed restaurant! Since its located downtown Georgetown there is a bunch of street parking and a few lots located a block or two away so not too terrible of a walk.  After reading a few reviews I was sold on the pizza by the slice especially if you are able to customize it however you want or from their list at dinner (5PM) it is only cheese or pepperoni. To start we had the sweet chili wings and they were delicious, had a nice crisp/crunch! Pizza was amazing and worth the wait, I had the pirate and the garlic on top just made the pizza even more amazing.  Service lacked a bit, but I can understand everyone has their off days and with the pandemic contact should be at a minimum. All in all, I will be back especially during lunch hours for more pizza by the slice."

My boyfriend was pleased with the abundance of sports on the many large screen TVs.   The food was good, especially his chicken enchiladas, which had a nice little bite. I opted for the seared salmon Caesar which was recommended by our server. The salmon was fresh, they have seafood shipped in fresh never frozen, but was a little bland. I enjoyed the salad all the same. It was a nice alternative on a day where we were unwilling to wait."

I've been craving fish and chips - which I've heard is one of their specialties.    We started with the Calamari Diablo - it wasn't as spicy as I expected, but it was delish! The calamari pieces were sliced thinner and crispy.  Peppered thru the dish were fried pickles and shaved Parmesan that complemented the appetizer nicely!  The dip was \"marinara-ish\" with sliced onions - Yummy!   The menu had plenty of great options but we both got fish and chips.  The plate was loaded with 3 large battered/fried cod pieces.   The crunch to fish ratio was on point!  The dish came with a unique slaw made from cabbage, apple slices and apple cider Vinegar- I couldn't place my finger on the spices but it was very tasty!  The thin sliced apples popped in the slaw.   The waffle fries were crunchy (I normally don't like waffle fries but these were thinner and possibly light battered/double fried with perfect seasoning.   We will definitely return ~ looking forward to trying more options from the menu and bringing friends with us next time."

                "description": "Never been to this location before but let me just say it is worth a visit.  I enjoy fish and chips and found that they do it just right here!  In my opinion the only thing I did not like was the waffle fries were crunchy, mainly because there's some weird additives they added to them, looks like some kind of sesame seeds or something.  Waffle fries are just fine by themselves with great seasoning no need to add weird crunchy stuff, I literally thought I was going to check my teeth only reason why I didn't go five stars here.  My wife got the blackened salmon Caesar salad which I must say was above and beyond with a ton of flavor! I will probably get this next time.  On another note their coleslaw is unlike anything I've had before some kind of a cilantro vinaigrette highbred but I must say I do anything to learn this recipe!  Decent draft beer selection and a handful of wines this place is worth a visit especially if it's game day and you're looking for a good game there's TVs in every direction you look pretty good sports bar especially at an upscale level I would recommend it definitely give this place a shot!"

I got the Joey's el Classico margarita and my fiancé got the roadrunner. Unfortunately my margarita was way too sour for me and I hate to be this person, but I asked if I could trade it out. Our waitress said yes and I got the jalapeño martini which was way more enjoyable. For an appetizer we got the Cuban nachos, which was basically the fillings of a Cuban sandwich served over a bed of homemade chips with a swiss queso. I'm salivating just writing this because it was so good we cleaned the plate!  For my meal I ordered the chicken fried steak that came with mashed potatoes, bacon green beans and Texas toast. Y'all....as a southern girl I consider myself a chicken fried steak aficionado, and they know what they're doing. The serving was huge, the breading  flavorful and crispy, and the gravy was so good I wanted to dip everything in it. You can also really tell that their sides are not an afterthought because the green beans were so good I couldn't stop eating them even well after I was full. My fiancé got the fish and chips and while I didn't personally try it he said it was delicious, and again, the portions were huge! You definitely get your money's worth here. Along with the great food we also had great service so next time we're in Georgetown we will definitely be back!"

I was hungry and had already tried some near by restaurants. This place was not busy and the ambiance seemed nice.  My friends and I were a starving and boy did we come to the right place. We started with cooked oysters that were absolutely mouth watering. One of my friends had never had oysters so I was excited that he enjoyed them. We also got the pork belly queso, it was a bit thick but full of flavor. The chips were crispy and seasoned which helped with the thick cheese. One friend got the Buffalo chicken sandwich, the biggest juiciest chicken breast I'd ever seen. He left nothing on his plate! My other friend go the fish and chips, he does not like coleslaw but this was no ordinary slaw. The head chef explained they don't use vinegar and they do add celery seed. I was the big girl and ordered the pork chop, large portion but I ate it down to the bone. I wish I had another option besides mashed potatoes but overall it was awesome. We did order cocktails, peach martini and margaritas. Our server was knowledgeable and very pleasant. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our food was fresh and hot and the wait wasn't long at all. I can't wait to go back and try desserts."

Two weeks later, I'm two days short of the half off apps. Ok cool. I wanted the shrimp and lobster roll. No longer on the not updated menu. Ok cool. I got the tiny flavorless not seasoned at all salmon and salad, grilled oysters which were excellent( they didn't last) and side stale waffle fries....... I get more fries for cheaper at McDonald. That are fresh. I pay $14/ 3-4 pieces of fresh salmon at heb. Sooooo this salmon has got to be bomb to justify this size for $18 w salad. All in all, not pleased w my second shot at this establishment."

The picnic tables outside are plentiful but were all full when we arrived. Luckily two guys let us join them. I had the Raspberry Berliner Weisse and it quickly became my new favorite. It is sweet and crisp without being overly sweet. Our friends both got the Cream Ale and loved it. We all walked out with growlers. Everyone there is super friendly and very welcoming. We had the baby with us which was fine (there were a few kids there)...but every time a car was exiting we would have to wrangle him down (minor downfall of basically sitting alongside the parking lot). We are looking forward to visiting again."

                "description": "Bluebonnet Beer Company is simply amazing. They are a little difficult to find, look for the side street behind the post office and you should notice it on the right.  Their beers are super delicious, I had the wit, pecan brown ale , cream ale and hef. Out of all of them, the cream ale and wit come highly recommended. They are so smooth and drinkable.  There is a schnitzel food trailer that serves some pretty decent food. The place is small but all of the employees I encountered were nice and friendly. For seating, there is only plastic benches avaliable located in the front of the brewery. Not really any kind  of shade or landacaping but this is expected since it is such a small brewery.  It may not have all of the amenities and backyard space that other larger breweries in Austin have. But if you love beer and want to interact with some awesome, friendly people then Bluebonnet Beer Company is the way to go. Everything is tasty and pints are currently at $5 each, you can't beat that price."

If it's cold outside, I highly recommend bringing a layer or two as there is only a bit of seating inside but about four picnic tables outside. Also, wait to grab dinner at the brewery as they have rotating food trucks Thursday-Saturdays. When we went, they had a lobster roll truck that served amazing rolls.   I started out with their Oktoberfest beer, which was very good! My mom, who is not a big beer drinker, got their shandy and thought it would be great for a hot day. The beers are $5 a pint, and I thought it was really cool they have a series related to the Immortal 10.   Parking is not a hassle, the beer is very good, the people are friendly, and your hardest job will be finding a seat. Enjoy!"

We know that they are popular and were even excited to try Jimmy Vega's Smokehouse but when we arrived half of the available tables were set as reserved. There was literally no where to sit. Every table was packed. We had our 3 yr old son with us, so standing wasn't an option, especially since we wanted to eat too. We asked anyway if any of the tables were available and was told no, they are all reserved for 5pm, but you could squeeze in anywhere else. In the end, we left irritated and disappointed, while I understand reserving tables, but when you only have 10 tables and you reserve 5 of them, that doesn't leave much room for anyone else."

Pretty flowers and lots of grass for kids to run in. The beer was delicious. I tried 3 five oz pours, all IPAs they were delicious!! You order the beer online and they call you when it's ready. Quick, easy and safe. Will def be back!  They have different food trucks , check their Facebook to see what's there when you're going."

When you walk in you have to stop at one counter where the attendant explains how you buy beer. So, it's 3, 12oz beers for $12. Then they hand you three poker chips and a glass that clearly won't hold 12oz of beer. The attendant at the station swings the pod around for you to select a tip option starting at 15%. You then turn and go 4 feet to the bar where the beer pourer tells you what type of beer they have and pours 8-9oz of beer in the mini beer glass. She has a tip jar as well. Out of curiosity I filled the mini beer glass with water and as I suspected the pour we received equaled 8-9oz. For the record, I would have agreed to $12 for three 8-9oz pours. Good beer, just don't piss on my leg when I buy it!"

We spent $30 on ten 7oz tasters but you were required to go back to the counter each time you wanted to try a new beer.  They only allow two people in the bar room at a time, which I appreciate as a Covid precaution, but when you have to go back inside ten times this isn't ideal.  We actually didn't get the chance to try all of the beers because they call last call at 4:20.  We couldn't get in line fast enough or even drink fast enough to get all of the beers we paid for.  We live about 30 min away and don't plan on going back."

Our Yelp buddies suggested that we check out this brewery and yes they have some pretty good beer. Their Longhorn Blonde is perfect for a non IPA person. The Tommy Raj IPA and Mosaic is on point and will satisfy even the most discriminating beer snob. Yea that means you you bearded flannel wearing... sorry for the digression. We had a great time and the brew folks and drinkers were helpful and friendly. Oh yea there was a bacon themed food truck onsite and it was great. OK who doesn't like bacon... Like bacon nachos!!!   Paul, so why three stars? So you buy 3 tokens for 3 pints at $15.00 you order a beer and you receive a 12 ounce bottled beer in a plastic cup. That is a party foul times two. So its hot in TX and the only AC is in the tasting/pay here room. Please add some fans on your porch and in the brewery area. I'm not going to chill er sweat on your porch in July. Plastic cups c'mon really.    You guys are brewing good beer..Add  some fans and glasses...."

We were met by host and hostess who indicated they turned the taps off at 4:40. It seems their plans tonight were more important than the customers. They said they were still on their winter hours which would be 5 PM. However, the website says close at 6 PM. They're handling of the event is less than hospitable. I concur with the rest of the reviews that say customer service is lacking, we won't be back."

It is definitely a community brewery with a chill, and laid back atmosphere (not often that you will find fresh farm eggs for sale in a Brewery tap room!).  Everyone seemed to know each other.  they have a covered outdoor patio that you can sip your beer at, or you can go inside to the production facility and sit at one of the picnic tables. Great open space with views of the expansive countryside. Their tap room/tasting room is small and is meant for purchases only.  You can purchase tokens to taste three half pours of their current beers on tap.  They didn't offer flights since at the time of our visit they only had 3 options to choose from.  The staff were incredibly friendly.  I liked how they supported local artisans for their creative labels.  Looking to do something during your visit?  You can check out one of their games that they have listed on a board in the tap room.  Their beer overall was OK."

They brew in the English style, taking advantage of the local limestone-rich water.    The regular lineup is a blonde, saison, English IPA, and stout. They had a couple \"happy accidents\" when we visited, including an aged stout with perfect licorice notes and a mead/English ale hybrid that delivers greatness.  Get out of the grind of Austin and experience this hidden gem!"

Go to San Gabriel River Brewing where the staff actually values business and doesn't try to run people off 30 minutes before close. The owner is a nice guy but the blonde bartender is a surly waste of oxygen. She was too worried about her 'girl's night' that she started booting people at 4:30 when the brewery closes at 5. Trash. Again. Go to San Gabriel River Brewing. Their staff is super nice and their beer isn't pedestrian garbage water."

They had a deal offering one of their glasses and three pours for $15. We tried several of their beers. My favorite was the Tommy Raj, an English IPA that had a great subtle hop flavor, really nice. I enjoyed the Longhorn Blonde too, nice easy to drink beer. We also tried Fire Balls, an Imperial Stout that also has an added flavor from Fireball whiskey. It was good, but a little does go a long way. Wicked River is a pale ale with a nice black cherry background flavor. They have seating in the brew room as well as on the front porch. We opted for the inside due to it being a little chilly. As other people showed up, the tables filled up and people started meeting new folks and visiting about the beer. The Baconette food truck was there and we had the bacon queso and the baconette burger. We enjoyed the Baconette food very much. Come out on Saturday and try their beers, you'll be glad you did."

                "description": "Wow I can't believe I've forgotten to review here. I LOVE their beer and location. Always great beers on rotation and the flight tray is cool.  Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

We got a selection of beers, I personally really enjoyed the Mango Crazy wheat beer and the Keyboard Gansta IPA. The service was also very friendly and they offered some samples if you are in between choices.   The taco truck outside was also very good! I highly recommend one of their loaded fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and tender in the middle, and super flavorful toppings. The tacos were also yummy and I'm a huge corn lover so the elote bowl was perfect.   I will definitely be back to try more of their seasonal beers!"

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

We did not try the burgers but from what I've seen/heard it's also very yummy! Whitestone is in a great location in Cedar Park, TX.

I ordered a specialty margarita on the rocks and it was just ok.  The table ordered the chicken fajitas, enchiladas and carnitas plate. The fajitas were overcooked and dry. The edges were burnt and the onions and peppers were sliced way too thin and were over cooked as well. The portion was very small from my last visit, but shrinkflation huh?? The enchiladas were very good and the carnitas were the favorite. The charro beans were awesome. The rice was bland and one dimensional and the street corn was overly sweet. The salsa was flavorful but at least one needs a little more heat. The restaurant itself is really cool and clean. I will definitely go back but on a different night maybe try a different dish and drink"

We got a reservation a little earlier than normal so we could take in the Christmas lights on the nearby Georgetown square.  Paige was our server and she did a great job. She was very attentive but didn't rush us. We started with chips and salsa, followed closely by the queso flameato, gooey and yummy .  Our meals included tortilla soup, shrimp chili relleno, street tacos and one of the special plates. Needless to say we waddled out... Our experiences in the past were a little inconsistent but this time they were right on point. Looked like there were enough employees to take care of the good crowd they had. It was fairly noisy though. Lots of families and groups.  Thanks Paige, keep up the good work! As I'm prone to say when it's appropriate, this is a repeater! Happy Holidays fellow Yelpers!"

I liked the Brussels sprouts and the chocolate cake, but why would I go to a Mexican restaurant for those?  I liked our waitress a lot, as we were a big party and she did her best.

Seating was quick for a party of three on a Wednesday night. They do take reservations so keep that in mind if you have a larger party.    ORDER  Chicken Flautas (start) Nachos (cut) Chips and Salsa (bench) Tres Leches   Food Flautas were good as were the chips and salsa. Nachos were surprising as the toppings were added to the chips and they're not the style where you can dip the chips. Not the style I'm used to but could be good for anyone trying to portion control.   Overall This would be a great place to take your out-of-town visitors because the service is good and the setting. I'd come back again and check out the bar area."

My favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and ambiance. It's relaxing, quiet shaded, and you can see the water below.   The service has always been pretty good, no complaints there.   The food is very good and the drinks too, their cucumber/jalapeno margaritas are perrrrfecccct.   I agree with many of the other reviews, it's much pricier than its competitors for very comparable tasting food. Post covid, you even have to pay for chips and salsa- which is unusual at a mexican restaurant."

                "description": "To be honest, I had given up on eating at this place some handful of years ago because I felt that the place was cooking Mexican food for the white-bread taste crowd. The food chronically lacked salt, seasoning or any interesting edge to it. Can you say \"Food for the old folks home\"?  But last week a friend of mine said to try again. said it had greatly improved, so I took his word for it and reluctantly went in....and can say that I was glad that I did.  They started us off with chips and salsa. Both the green (especially this one) and the red salsas were excellent and actually spicy, thank God.   We also ordered queso flameado with shrimp and chicken tortilla soup, both packed with flavor and quality ingredients.  The guacamole the we got was passable. Not as horrifically bland as is used to be BUT still needs a healthy dose of lime juice and salt which we ordered with it. Even or waiter said that it always needs more lime and salt, so, hey,just fix it already.  Everything else was also very nice, like the great seating outside and the bar drinks. I can see that they finally got some cooks that know this type of food and I am very happy about it. I WILL definitely be back.  My suggestion. You guys are finally on a roll regarding a more authentic taste. Don't rest yet!  You are only a few bold menu changes from being something truly great!"

The cucumber margarita is super refreshing, I highly recommend it. The guacamole didn't have much flavor but the blandness of the guac was needed to cool your mouth after eating the salsa. Cool vibe inside, the patio seating is beautiful but will have to wait until it's not 100 degrees out to enjoy the view."

They were out of pacifico, modelo especial and don't carry corona. Opted for 2 margaritas - not bad but not great. Until I went to pay and 2 mediocre margaritas (not even cadillac)  were over $33!!!! What on earth?! Honestly, unacceptable. These are worse than concert prices. Not going back for happy hour ever and may not even eat in the restaurant for a bit."

                "description": "We chose El Monumento last night for my daughter's 33rd birthday. Best dining decision that will now become a tradition and a craving.   We started with chips and salsa as well as queso and one of the monthly special cocktails, the smoky jalapeño margarita. We also enjoyed the aqua Fruita non alcoholic beverage as well. Between the 5 of us, we sampled several dinner options including the street tacos, the enchiladas, and the relleno. They were all spectacular and even though I had no space in my tummy to finish it all, I couldn't stop.   Ryan, our server, made the experience even more special. I can always tell if a server is being nice to get a tip, which I can understand, but Ryan was honestly genuine and engaging without being intrusive.   The restaurant itself is beautiful with a generous deck that provides ample room to dine outdoors.   We will be back, sooner rather than later as I am already craving more Chile rellenos. You won't be disappointed!!"

We had an excellent server and really liked the \"Snug\" we sat in.  The seating options are pretty and a unique feature actually.   Seating: Large tables, small tables, \"Snugs\"(private little cubby with plenty of room), bar seating, outdoor tables and cozy seating around a fireplace outside.   The food: Pretzel w/ dipping trio. Yes! These are excellent w/ an awesome sourdough flavor.  The fish and chips was pretty good. Great batter with a ton of flavor in it. The pizza (ordered without the pepperoni). The dough was under proved and under cooked. Ok at best.  The irish stew was pretty to look at but had none of the heart or depth of flavor that you'd expect from a stew. My soul was craving a hot heart stew, no luck. Disappointing.   Drinks: No wells here!! Just a quality selection of excellent wines and spirits.   We'll definitely be back and try a new selection of foods! If you're looking for a place to visit/meet up, this is a great venue. Plentyyyyyy of room!!"

I want to start off by saying I hadn't eaten breakfast, lunch, or dinner prior to arriving there which you could only imagine I was hangry(hungry + angry)    So I park my car and Soon as I step on the curb to make my way towards the door the hostess had already opened the door and was greeting my wife and I with a warm and friendly greeting.   As a manager myself, I always preached that our customers should never have to touch the door and I was so glad to see this establishment have the same values about it as I do.   We sat down and in no time our waiter Homer was at our table greeting us. I must say he was very personable. He truly grasp the concept of building rapport with his customers.   The food came out pretty quick which was a huge plus because a I stayed before I was \"Hangry\"  My fries were cold, but then again they're fries so I just asked for some fresh ones that had some heat to it lol.  My wife order the 8HR Braised Short Rib and she stated it was just ok.  I asked for lemon pepper wings, My receipt shows that's what I got, but I can tell you that want what came in my plate. Was I made about it NO, why you ask? Because whatever the heck it was taste pretty darn good. I should have asked what was I given because I wouldn't mind ordering it again.  My fish and chips was freaking AMAZING and whatever little SAUCE they give you to dip you food into.... AMAZING!!! make sure you ask for extra so you get enough to dip your fries in it to lol. My wife tried my fish and chips and said she couldn't wait to come back to get that next time.   On our way out the door the host struck again with grabbing the door for us and she did it with a smile. As I was walking my way to the car another employee told me how much they appreciated our business and I'm thinking to myself write your done working your on your way to your own car to head home and you still take the time out to make is feel special. I feel that the friendly service has us excited to come back and eat here again and we are looking forward to it."

Out of almost everything we wanted. Food was average and took forever coming out. Second time was a lot better. Nice table on the counter patio. Food was available and came in a timely manner.

We had reservations but switcheroooed on her with the table and she was super nice. Found us the perfect spot.  Angel was our waitress and she was just as great! Larger group... kept her cool... recommended great choices for us.. I had half arugula salad and sandwich and 2 glasses of Sauv Blanc ... the managers came by and checked on us... one lady and one man...  Great service, great outdoors... good filtered water... yes I can tell...  I will be back to try out patio and bar in the very near future!  Would love to try more items on the menu. And I did tell Angel I would be back to see her... I love that it's dog friendly and the outdoor seating is amazing... love the string lights... good ambiance... clean bathrooms...  Great for lunch date, happy hours or large groups!"

Came here one weekend for brunch and brought our toddler not great for them. They don't have high chairs here so not the most toddler friendly place. Think again if you child is learned to sit etc, not a bad spot for older kids though.  Overall decent spot I'm sure we will be back for work happy hours"

It's the only time I'm down to go to a pub - I'm not a beer person but I love a good beer battered Irish fish and chips. The only way I'd take beer.  The place is gorgeous, spacious (big groups are welcome!)  We wished we didn't have to leave. Their back patio is beautifully by a creek. They also control the mosquitoes which could ruin any patio dining experience for me. It's a win all around!  I can't wait to come back to this piece of Ireland in Round Rock, the managers told us that a lot of their restaurant decor are from Ireland shipped here. That's pretty personal and lovely in my book."

Staff is friendly, never have I ran into any issues with reservation or walk ins. If you want to sit outside I would recommend just calling in and making a reservation.   PET FRIENDLY! Same goes with my recommendation with a reservation, if you're bringing your pet just make one so they know where to seat you outdoors. Call before :)  The menu is great! I've tried a lot of different vegetarian/pescatarian options on the menu and haven't been disappointed. You have to try the pizza!   I don't drink alcohol so I can't review on that but from what I see and have heard it's really tasty.   I love going to lunch and dinner here, so much fun.   The patio has one of the chillest vibes in the area.  Go eat and chill! :)"

                "description": "First of all, the place is beautiful inside and out. That's the main sell 100%. The food is good and so are the drinks but a little overpriced for their outdoor menu. A guiness draught at any type of irish pub shouldn't go for $9 nor any bar for that matter in my opinion. All food and drink prices could be $1-2 less, especially if it's a limited outdoor menu. If we were dining in (and it's beautiful inside + full menu offered), I could see those prices being fair. If the drinks were to be $1-2 less in the future, we could see ourselves being regulars, but definitely not until then.  Two of our friends ordered the wagyu burger, when asked on how it compares to a non-wagyu burger, they said they wouldn't have noticed anything especially different to a regular burger in comparison if they had not read the menu.  Nonetheless, they seemed to enjoy it.   I would order the reuben sandwich again with the kimchi slaw. I thought the kimchi slaw was very creative and it added nice flavor contrast to the otherwise classical meaty cheesy aspects of the reuben. The kimchi by itself was good, they use older more fermented kimchi, which gave the sandwich a bit of sourness to it.   My wife ordered the fish n' chips, one of her favorite barfoods. The fish itself was very moist and tender and it appears much larger in portion size than what we were expecting when looking at other user's yelp photos. The chile-lime tartar sauce wasn't very 'chile-limey' at all, it tasted just like regular tartar sauce, don't get me wrong - we LOVE any tartar sauce, but they could dial up the chile and lime all the way to the moon if that's what they're advertising.   Lastly, the staff was nice, although our waitress basically dissappeared for the second half of our stay and kept forgetting/taking an unquestionably and questionably long time to get our drinks and takeout box. Service was just OK, there is always next time.   Bonus points for the restrooms, very neat, clean and well decorated."

The Fish and Chips  and Reuben Sandwich are delicious and portions generous. The craft beer is also the best (Huckleberry wheat).  Plus the place is filled with great atmosphere, and plenty of history. Our server (Jewels) pointed out the wall plaques located all along the restaurant filled with tidbits of information. This contributes to the experience. The music is great and staff friendly. A very happy place! We drove from South Austin to visit, definitely retuning soon!"

I had the charred vegetables which were delicious although the portion was quite small. The pepperoni pizza is cooked in a wood fire oven and was delicious. Overall, it was a good experience, my cons would be the service (organization still balbutiating and we waited 30 min for our drinks) and it's pricey for the size of the portions. $14 a cocktail is overpriced, but their craft beers were good."

The drinks were \"okay\". Not great, but not bad. The food was what was disappointing. I ordered the flaming bacon burger. The waitstaff that brought it over, said \"wait I have to light it on fire\", and she took off quickly without another word and before I could ask how long I was supposed to leave it lit- We had said we hadn't been there before, so it was all new.  So my entrée tasted like 151. It was gross. The fries were pretty generic, so they didn't make up for the burger debacle. Likely to return? Nah."

We had a group of 6 that was sat outside on patio. We ordered charcuterie, pretzels, wedge salad, hot wings and lemon pepper wings, a beer flight, the Carrie Bradshaw, the smoked margarita and a few standard mixed drinks.  After placing our order, we were brought 5 place settings for the 6 of us. We asked several times for the 6th set which was eventually delivered after all the food was gone. The servers keep saying that they didn't have any silverware or plates left!  ‍  Our drink orders rolled out so slow that we had to go to the bartender ourselves to make sure the order was ever placed. The manager came over to apologized which was very nice and professional.  The charcuterie was delivered without any explanation  of what everything was. It was a very odd mix of flavors from sweet to acidic that did not pair well.  The pretzels were by far everyone's favorite. But it was also served with no description of the 3 sauces. The thick white cream was actually an amazing garlic butter that we all devoured once we finally figure it out.  The wedge salad looked beautiful and was enough for all 6 of us to have some. I only thought it was weird that they covered it in ranch inside of blue cheese   Both flavors of hot wings were so salty that it ruined the rest of the flavors. The sizes were good though.  All of their beers except the ipa fell flat and not good. The mixed drinks were super yummy and I really enjoyed my Carrie Bradshaw.   The 6 of us were all in agreement that this place was such a sad waste. It looks so cool and could be really something great if they execute their food on a higher level and manage their staff/facility better.  We won't be back unless they can turn it around"

I started with a glass of caymus since it's $2 off for Happy Hour and although it's yummy as usual the tiny pour made me a little sad but I have to remember some people measure wine to the T. We also had the drink with Tito's and watermelon and the one with empress gin and rosemary, both were tasty and again $2 off for happy hour. For an appetizer we had the pretzels and the short ribs and both were prepared well. Finally our meal, I had the Cuban sandwich and my friend had the roasted vegetables, no complaints about either and I'd absolutely order the Cuban again. I'll definitely be back but may steer clear of wine due to tiny pours unless I get a bottle."

                "description": "We visited again this weekend, our third time since the opening, with another couple who was joining and had not yet been to CandB.  All of us commented how the atmosphere is lively and how we like the decor and that service is good.  But the consensus this time, as at our other visits is that the menu is somewhat disappointing.  The food is a cross between general bar food and a smattering of Irish pub dishes.  What we had was fine but a variety of true entrees is what's lacking.  Maybe more Irish fare would be good like shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, smoked salmon, etc.?  The burgers and sandwiches are okay but just a few more options would be great."

The beer and cocktail selection is fantastic, too. I will have to update my review after we have the opportunity to eat indoors. After two visits, the outdoor menu (while great), was getting a bit redundant. Chicken wings, salads and pretzels all very good.   I believe they have more offerings inside, so again -- we'll try that as soon as possible.  Also: don't miss the restrooms! They are super cool. The women's room was inspired by the luxury restrooms on the Titanic, I believe!"

                "description": "Well-crafted beers and delicious pizza - what more could you ask for? Humble Pint is one of our favorite spots and a friendly reminder that Leander has a lot more going for itself than just a sleepy suburb.  Beer: As a former Austin proper resident and frequent brewery visitor, HP's beers are on par with the best of the best. Their daily selection is small but mighty. They typically offer one of everyone's favorite core beers: a blonde, a hefe, an IPA, etc. Also some sours or seasonals thrown into the mix. I appreciate that they focus on small batches that are incredibly delicious and complex.  Pizza: Bubbly, chewy crust that's on the thinner side. It's not wet or greasy. Holds its integrity to toppings with great flavor. Speaking of toppings, their mainstay pies are a beautiful blend of ingredients. Personal faves are the Mt. Rainier - sauce, mozz, pepperoni, mushrooms, hot oil, Kalamata olives, and fresh arugula - and the Willamette - sauce, mozz, pepperoni, and fresh oregano. The fresh oregano is a really lovely touch that even my picky 3-year-old appreciates.  Finally, because I'd be remiss to mention the kids, this place is definitely family friendly. But if you don't have kids then don't let that scare you away. It's actually pretty quiet and chill, perfect for a date or even to get some work done during the afternoon. They have large open windows that look out on a beautiful cemetery (it's cool not creepy) as well as an outdoor patio.  10/10."

                "description": "My friend brought me back here because he felt like he owed me for my previous truncated visit. My last time I slammed the beers I had and didn't get anything to eat.   My latest visit I had some time to sit, sip and savor. Who would have thought that having time to enjoy a beer would make it more enjoyable. I had the same amount of beers this visit that I did the last but I did get to go through it, get some thoughts.  I was feeling a little peckish so we got the shishitos, or rather I did. I ordered them thinking my friend would also dig in, but I found out he's not into just eating peppers even though I told him it was mild. While I did feel a little guilty about eating them by myself I felt less guilty as I ate through the well blistered, sweet/hot peppers which were all a good size. They must have picked out the runts, which is something other establishments don't. It made for the peppers to be more uniform and also all the peppers were blistered at the same rate."

                "description": "We go here all the time. It's kid friendly and they always have tons of high chairs available. The pizza is most excellent. It's kind of like neopolitian style pizza, but not as floppy. Chewy crust, great toppings. Look, I'm not a word smith, but it's really delicious, trust me. Easily top 5 best pizza in central Texas. The beer is f*****g fantastic. Seriously, every beer I've had here has been stellar. Their current stout is baller; I grabbed a couple of them to go, but wish I grabbed more. It's called like Into the Void or something. Whatever, it's awesome. Also all their other beers are solid.   P.S. If the owner is reading this, you should add some anchovies to the menu imo."

The pizzas are good but all only personal size and quite expensive. All in all this was a fun experience but not for regular visits at $15 a pizza for 12in size. The mix and match of original ingredients was delicious to try. I had the Mt Rainer and it was not terrible but had a slight minty flavor that wasn't my favorite."

Yes it's a brewery, but kids are welcome too. There are food and drink options for both the over and under 21 crowd.   -Dogs are welcome on the patio!  -They have a game bookcase where you can take one to your table and play while enjoying a tasty beer or a Mexican Coke.   -The master brewer knows what he is doing.  My husband home brews and knows some things.  He was chatting with the brewer/owner and they were both geeking out all about the different beers.   -There's always several different beers and beer styles on tap to try out. They even do flights if you can't decide on just one.   -The Humble Pies aka PIZZA are super tasty. We have tried almost all of them and they have all been hits. My favorite is the Columbia Gorge one with goat cheese and sausage. They are available after 4pm every day.   -They make great paninis and salads too. They are available starting at 12pm.   I don't do salads, but I can tell you the Italian Panini was DELICIOUS. My only complaint was it was too small because I wanted more of it because it was so yummy.   -The staff is so friendly and welcoming. It has a neighborhood bar vibe and is so laid back. It's a great addition to the area for sure.   The moral of the story is this place is a hit! Come check it out when you get a chance."

We recently moved out to Leander/Liberty Hill and this is a great little spot for us. Daughter had salad with delicious balsamic vinaigrette.  I had Panini. Husband had pizza.  It was all delicious.  And quick.  So it was like an easy quick in and quick out for a school night.   it was counter service and affordable.  I feel like with 3 of us --we can't leave a restaurant for less than $120 after tip.  We left here for 1/2 of that with 2 drinks on the tab.    We'll be back!"

                "description": "Humble Pint is a great addition to the brew scene up here in the northern colonies. HP is located in the same strip mall area as Leanderthal distillery and Farm to Fork restaurant. This is the trifecta for me great booze, food, and brew.    The folks at HP are super friendly and beer knowledgeable. HP definitely has a Pacific NW vibe just check out the names of their pizza pies.     HP has a wonderful array of craft beers (there are ciders and non-boozy options as well) ranging from a light blonde to a  Belgium Tripel.  Basically, there is something for all.   Plus one ordered the Yard's Done Blonde ale and it was lite but flavorable. My Cascadian Dark Ale, was a deep brown ale that was not heavy and reminded me of a Brit porter. Cascadian hops keep the Pacific NW theme rolling!   We arrived too early for pizza (starts at 4PM) but we both ordered the Italian panini and it arrived warm and smothered with provolone cheese.  There was a healthy amount of chips accompanying our panini and neither of us was able to finish off the chips. We can't wait to return and try their pies.   When the weather is nice there is a patio that is covered and the inside dining is spacious and they are following all the restrictions.    If you are in the area do plan to stop by for a brew or two and a panini or better yet a pizza pie!"

The pizza kitchen opens at 4:00p and seems a little overwhemled right now as it's taking a hot minute to get 1 pizza, but it's all good because we have beer . The pizza was really good. The crust is chewy delicious. Can't wait to try a different one next time.  We're happy to have a new business like this here in Leander and think they'll continue to do well. We'll definitely be back to SUPPORT LOCAL!   Tip to biz: Please add those large rotating fans on your deck. It's TX, it's damn hot in heerr!"

The tables had plenty of space between each other to feel safe taking down the mask to eat and drink.   The drinks were great and it wasn't all just IPAs full of hops like other craft breweries. The pizza is easy to eat and not too thick to make you full, leaving plenty of room for beers.   Going to make this a regular place to wind down from the week. Great staff l, very friendly, and they make sure your satisfied."

                "description": "I have to say that I am SUPER disappointed in my 2nd visit here.   The first time I came here (when the had just open), A friend and I had a GREAT experience. The owners wife was behind the bar and he was doing other things. Anyhow, she made my friend and I feel extremely welcomed. She talked to us about the beer and just chatted with us. There was only about 4 other people/customers there. She told us that their kitchen didn't open till 4pm but that we were more then welcome to buy food and bring it in (which we did). We sat inside, ate, and had some beers. She (I think her name was Alisha aka the owners wife. Sorry If that's not your name) came the table and asked how everything was and if we needed anything. We had a great experience!   Now today, On our second visit (same friend), we had a horrible experience. After our first visit we knew about them not serving food till 4pm, so we ordered food again from Next door. However, this time the girl behind the bar (not the owners wife) told us \"outside food has to be eaten outside\". Knowing that it was super windy out, she made us eat outside. We were fighting the wind from blowing everything off the table. After we finished eating, we moved back inside to get away from the wind and the experience got worse. The bartender was just cold/kinda rude, none of the staff asked us how things were, the staff themselves weren't even talking to each other, and the overall vibe of the place was just cold. We were the ONLY ones there this time and we still got the cold shoulder.   I hope this place gets better because the place is cute and had potential."

Smiled and greeted when I walked in and guided me through the beer menu and the pizza menu. The pizza was fantastic. We got the Mt. Rainer.

It was meh but it filled our bellies so in that aspect it got the job done.   The drinks are where it is at here. My husband ordered a flight of beer. Tons of options to choose from. I ordered Bishop cider on draft. I got the strawberry (my favorite) and also the apple pineapple. All the drinks were good.  We noticed that staff attention to customers had been a little lacking and very slow. I think this has more to do with our crappy country and COVID. But who am I to judge? We just made sure to grab our check before I was even close to being done with my second glass."

                "description": "What a great place in downtown Round Rock! We met a friend here for drinks late, and the wait staff was wonderful! I don't think I've ever been in a bar with such nice and professional staff. They have an epic beer selection. Though beer isn't my thing, the selection still impressed me! They helped me select a beer, as I said, beer isn't my thing. They were patient and actually found me an option to \"get me through the night\". I did move on to margaritas though, and were these delicious! So why the 4 starts, well, they kept running out of things. For instance, my margarita went skinny when they ran out of the regular mix they use. Then, they ran out of limes! The margaritas, even the skinny ones, were fantastic! They use A LOT of ice, but still tasted delicious. Decor was wonderful for Christmas. It was just a warm and inviting space. We will definitely go back if we are ever back in that area! Parking was sufficient, as it was a weeknight. I'm sure that helped for it not to be too crowded. Everything was very clean also. Just a great place to go and meet with friends over drinks. If you're expecting tapas, call ahead to see when the kitchen closes. The kitchen had closed shortly after we got there, which was a bummer. Regardless, check this place out if you're in the area!"

The back courtyard has giant Jenga and other games and there are plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors. Just recently tried their food and the loaded fries were pretty good! I was looking around at surrounding tables and their food all looked great. Can't wait to try more here in the future. Tons of beer on tap and very knowledgeable bartenders who make great recommendations. I will say that their cocktail availability is slim but definitely a good spot for beer."

Service is outstanding, they always have A great selection of beer on tap and if you are confused or just can't decide, ask, staff is great and matching your preferences to their current selections. Over the last couple weeks my friends and I have enjoyed flatbreads and sandwiches - Tasty and fresh. The options these days in this area, post Covid, are rather slim - But it is definitely worth you stopping in and staying for a while...

                "description": "I was looking forward to returning to the Brass Tap because I have had a good experience on a prior visit. There were a couple of mistakes by our server at first, but I chalked it up to him possibly being new or simply having an off night. Unfortunately, the service progressively got worse throughout the dinner. From spilling a drink on the table, to telling us he wasn't focused, to the bartender remaking the drink and under pouring it, and it taking almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we asked three times for it, you can't blame it on anything but a lack of effort. Continuous poor service can truly ruin an evening if you let it."

                "description": "My Fiancee' and two friends of ours visiting from Dallas area decided to check this place out on Friday night.  I read the reviews on Yelp (as I always do before going), and suggested this place to them.  I am sorry for doing so. We got there, in what seems to be happening area of downtown Round Rock, which I did not know existed.  There are several bars in this same stretch of road.  Parking was easy on the street.  Once we got in, it has the bar and lot of the front area filled (no social distancing here).  Sign at the front read, \"Seat yourself, and we will find ya\".  We sat at a table/booth section across from the bar near the back.  Our waiter, seems like he did not know much.  We asked him questions, and he was not sure.  We found out though, if you don't want beer, they are limited on other alcohol.  I wanted a Grey Goose and tonic.  They did not have Grey Goose.  I asked for Ketel One.  They did not have.  They said they only have local vodkas, \"Dripping Springs\" and \"Titos\".  I went with \"Titos\" and waiter asked three times, what I wanted with the vodka.  My friend got a \"Apple-tini\".  It came in a very small v-shapped glass, that looked like not much more then a shot...and it had ice chips floating in her drink.  She used to be a bartender, and knew that is not what you are supposed to have there.  Also, her boyfriend had a Long Island Ice tea.  He sipped it, and it was not tasting right.  So, she walked up to the bar to get it fixed.  They told her to go back and get her mask and come back (*mind you, no patrons at bar were wearing a mask).  She did so, and ask if they could remake it.  They did so, and brought to our table by different waitress person, and he tasted it, and still not right.  So, my friend asked the waitress if they knew what they put in it.  They went thru all the ingredients and found out they use \"lemonade\" instead of  \"sweet and sour\" , which made it taste really sweet.  The food was just ok.  My friend got a salad, and looked like left over pieces of lettuce they had lying around. The nachos were just ok, and the reuben and cuban were ok.  It took us about 15 min or more just to get our waiter to come back to get bill.  They pay attention to bar area, but not much in area around it.  Sorry, won't be back."

I was shushed and shunned by the staff for having any kind of point of view. I decided to move to the main bar to be by myself and was then questioned by the staff, who blew the whole thing out of proportion. I was told that I needed to leave the premises by some screening bartender because I was \"disturbing other people\"; all while never raising my voice. If the staff had not perpetuated drama, it would have been dropped. I would not suggest this bar unless you're absolutely certain that you're going to be quiet and pay for over price drinks for underwhelming service from the newer waitstaff. Weak management."

Every month they switch up which brewery they get select draft beers from, notably good draft  breweries!  This month they were featuring Clown Shoes, a brand that  has some really great  IPAs and high % which is nice. Tried a 12.5% stout while here and it was amazing. For sure a beer lovers bar!"

Walking in gave me comforting coffeeshop vibes, with mostly tables of small parties 2-3 drinking beer and socializing.  Having no idea what to order, staff made some recommendations for a flight that were all fantastic. My favorites were the Cuerno Rojo (lightly carbonated and very smooth) and the Continental Breakfast (heavier stout but tastes just like French Toast and Maple syrup). I had to do a double take that I wasn't just drinking syrup but the flavors were spot on!  I'll be back again with friends/family and hopefully get to enjoy the great coffee I was smelling as well!"

The kids enjoyed the chips and salsa while we sipped our stellar brews. Excited to try the Leander location that is actually closer to us. 10/10 plan to come back, especially to try the coffee."

Red Horn just gets better and better with age and has really turned into a community institution - especially during the pandemic when they switched to \"to go\" beers that we could all take out to the parking lot and drink while socially distanced. Fortunately those days are past us but I think I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this place that was a little bit of sanity amidst all the insanity.   As for the fare itself? The beers rotate and you can't  go wrong because they will always let you sample (I'm a strawberry pop-tart ravioli fan - and yes that's a beer). Pair that beer (or wine) with a meat and cheese tray or maybe a panini and you have absolutely nothing to complain about. They even have food trucks on most days...  Thanks for being here Red Horn."

Really appreciate the indoor and outdoor seating.  Really live the tables and decor, rustic hand built feel but comfortable.  Snack food is overpriced but everything else is top notch."

                "description": "We chose Red Horn Coffee after perusing local coffee spots for some good coffee. Red Horn was very highly rated and the photos looked like they offered genuine espresso beverages. Red Horn offered a number of non-dairy options so I would not destroy my stomach on my pending road trip. We ordered Americans with a half inch of steamed oat milk. The coffee was very smooth. The espresso taste was still solid enough that I knew I was drinking espresso. I.e. Not watered down at all. All-in-all a great cup of coffee that hit the spot."

                "description": "I'll be back soon!! One of the best coffees I've had, so good I had two during my short stay here. It's hard to find decaf that isn't boring and the decaf here is strong and full of flavor! I even purchased a pound of decaf beans to take home.   I pulled up and my first thought was that the vibe was more brewery than coffee shop and I was right, but I was wrong that the coffee would just be an afterthought. When I went on a Saturday early afternoon, there was a taco truck and people hanging out in the beer garden. Lots of bicyclists and not sure if it's a popular rest stop or because there's a bike shop in the same parking lot or both or something else. Once you step inside there is a giant section of beer taps and beer menu, and a small coffee and pastry menu. They also sell ice cream here which was tempting but I stuck to my americano and later a vanilla latte.   The inside has plenty of socially distanced seating as does the outside and I lucked out with a parking spot right out front. There's a large lot of shared parking for the businesses.   I want to come back to check out their beers!!"

You can get coffee, lattes, and cappuccino served anytime or also buy their beans to go.   They usually have 30+ taps of delicious craft beer which 10-15 being their beers with other guest beers also. They normally have cans to go and they will do growler fills as well. Its unusual to find a place that has both really good beer and great coffee but Red Horn is just that. There are a few slightly more secluded tables where I'll see people working remotely quite often. Most weekends you can find a local artist performing live music too."

Not only is their coffee delicious they have a great variety of beers to choose from. They have recently expanded their outdoor seating which is covered so great for all hours of the day. Parking is sometimes limited but it speaks for its self on how many people love coming here. It's a great place to study, relax, and meet up with friends but get there before rush hour if you wanna snag a good seat inside. Clean environment and staff is very friendly! Also, great music"

Weeks later, I walked in with our service tiny chihuahua dog (since there's a sign that says \"we welcome service dogs\" so I went in and ordered coffee and as soon as I began to wait for my coffee to be ready so I could take it to go there is this man that was very abrasive behind the counter and I miss felt like I was in the principals office and he said that dogs are not allowed in the facility.  He was very abrasive embarrassing and in my face. I personally think if you don't allow dogs at all then take the service sign dog off the window. It's a shame because that's very close place for us to get coffee but I don't want to have that feeling again."

Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

All you have to do is to ask, and they'll give a great recommendation. It's probably the thing you'll always want to do as they carry seemingly hundreds of brands of beer.   And it seems like they are trying to bring more cool events to the Cedar Park area like Comedy nights and Movie nights. Check it out and check out their vintage pinball machines!"

Walk in and turn left to place your order at the counter.  If you want to drink .. walk in and go straight to the bar.  They have salads, apps and several speciality pizzas ... sized from individual to family. You get soda from the fountain (cherry, cream, cola, etc) or beer from the tap (too many to cover here).   There are a few booths and tables but mainly it is community seating at 20' long tables. Kind of cool I think.  TVs everywhere ... watched baseball and ESPN. I bet this place is lit on Sat and Sun for football.  So the food? I really liked the beer mates .. garlic cheese bread. Good size and flavor for just $5. I had the pear honey pizza .. add blue cheese, basil and pancetta. I really liked the way the flavors all stuck out .. sweet, herby, salty ... love it!!"

You order the food and beer separately, food from a walkup counter and beer from the bar in the middle of the restaurant. You get a buzzer puck when you order food so the servers can locate you and bring it to your table. We ordered the Beer Mates and Pizza Roll appetizers to start and two pizzas, the Oo La La and the Shroomin' Goat. Food timing was staggered and the only real hiccup was that the Beer Mates appetizer order seemed to have gotten lost because we had to ask for it after all the rest of our order had trickled out, and it then took about 15min more for it to finally arrive. But, when it did, it was piping hot and fresh, so that's good. Food quality was very good and we enjoyed everything we ordered."

If you love pepperoni or sausage  grease then this is the place for you.   If you don't then don't get these meats on your pizza.  I hope the kitchen learns about skimming  fat off their more flavor proteins to prevent the crust from being a fatty sponge.  Happy Sunday everyone."

I had trouble finding and tasting the brisket as it was non existent. The chopped jalapeños were hard to find and taste as well. There were plenty of pickled onions. To sum it up, this pizza sucked !!! I should've stuck to my favorite the Banh Mi with extra sausage and extra jalapeños. Lesson learned and money lost, such is life."

                "description": "Haven't been back to Pinthouse since Covid and since we loved the food we wanted to go back.  Glad they were busy but I have to say, while the pizzas and salads are absolutely great, the service seemed off. I know this is mostly a serve yourself model but it felt awkward standing with my family trying to see if anyone would help us find a seat. We stood there quite a while and once in a while a server would walk past us, look at us and keep walking. It would have been nice for one of them to smile and say 'sit anywhere' or something helpful. I knew I'd have to stand in line to order, then go back for refills, and finally to close out my tab. I guess the two things that chapped me most after  the seating thing was first, when we asked the server who brought our pizza for 1 more plate and fork and she said 'sure,' then never came back and second, I was presented the option to pay a tip from 15-25% when I closed out my tab. Now I almost always over tip because I'm in hospitality and try to support exceptional service. I did tip but felt it wasn't really deserved, sadly.  Outside the service issues, we will likely try it again as I know finding enough good employees is very tough now and we LOVE any restaurant that is part of the Jack Allen family because the food is SOOOOO good.  I hope owners will work on the service and keep the high quality of the food and beer.  Cheers"

I believe that the round rock location is definitely the best of the Pinthouses. Their beer selection is quite diverse, the food is just hands down amazing and there are also options such as cider, wine, hard kombucha (thanks hipsters) for non beer drinkers.   I'm struggling to think of one bad thing to say and just to say  something- it's the crowds on Friday and Saturday evenings.

                "description": "Pinthouse Pizza was recommended by a bartender at another local brewery when we asked for suggestions for other places to visit while vacationing in the area. We stopped in at the Round Rock location and figured out the ordering process - order at the counter or at the bar, get a beeper, and your food is delivered to your table. If you have questions about the beer, I suggest you order at the bar. We ordered our food at the counter, but when I asked a beer question, I was referred to the bar. The bartender was very helpful. I ordered a flight and she offered some feedback on one of my choices. There was a combination of booth, bar, and common tables. We chose the common table to have the best view of the Red Sox/Yankees playoff game. Go Sox! The queso and salad came out first. The queso was good; the Italian salad was amazing. The individual salad was enough to share. The Shroomin' Pizza was very good too; I thought the crust was phenomenal and enjoyed dipping the end pieces in leftover salad dressing. The last thing I'd like to mention is how environmentally friendly this place is; paper products are compostable, pizza plates and utensils are metal. There's very little waste here! I would definitely recommend Pinthouse Pizza!"

And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

The kids had chicken strips and mac n cheese. The beers were good and cold. I love how they bring the beer in icy glasses.   We chose to sit outside but soon discovered the flies were way too many to be able to eat in peace. We couldn't stop waving our hands or the flies would land on the food. I'll go back, but sit inside next time."

Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

                "description": "Sorry this is a little late but I wanted to give a review. I stopped by here a couple weeks ago for dinner. The place was full, but they squeezed me in at the bar. I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

But the mash and veggies had great flavor and tasted good!  Texas Smash is good if you like a honey whiskey, I don't.  But the old fashion was just how I like it!  Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

This was the perfect place to sit back, chill and enjoy great food and company. I really like the ambience of this restaurant. It boasts a laid back feel with the dim lighting, yet has an open atmosphere. I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and everything was cooked to perfection. The salmon was cooked on the medium side to my liking and request to the server. We also ordered the James Bowie Nachos. Keep in mind these are not the typical Tex-Mex nachos, but they were still delicious and flavorful with a hint of robust BBQ flavor. There is an option to add chicken or steak and we opted for the chicken...great choice! If you love spicy (I sure do), they have a kick to them, as they are topped with freshly sliced jalapenos. Our server was excellent! She was so friendly, accommodating and checked on us frequently. She alone deserves a 5-star recognition! Try this place that offers locally-sourced, high quality food with its own, unique flavor."

I ordered the El Cesar Chavez salad with salmon and when they food came out the first bite I took I was fishing a bone out of my mouth from the salmon. So I started to inspect the rest of the fish and found 3 more bones. I informed our waitress and she kindly had it re made but when the second salmon came out I once again found 2 more fish bones inside.   At this point I did not receive an apology nor did a manager come by to check in to if everything was okay so I asked to speak to one and inform him. The gentlemen came over and apologized but really did not seem genuine about it after I explained how dangerous it was that I found a total of 6 fish bones that I could have choked on. He also attempted to blame the chef for not cleaning it right and saying \"I always tell him to make sure all the bones are out.\"   Coming from the restaurant business myself and having my husband be on the corporate side of a big restaurant chain - I was very disappointed in how this place dealt with the issue.   Please check your seafood at this place - they clearly are not ordering boneless seafood or properly cleaning they're fish."

                "description": "Was there about 9 pm last night. My companion wanted a really good burger and Yelp gave us this place.   We were the only patrons eating at tables. There were a few guys at the bar. Since I wasn't really hungry, we decided to order their signature burger which is made with ground brisket and ground meat from short ribs. I asked for it to not be overcooked. We talked about the cooking temperature with the waitress and she assured us it would be cooked medium. When it came out it was more like well-done. Pretty dry meat and not all that tasty. The bun seemed like it was homemade and was good, as were all the veggies they put on it. Fries were nothing special.   We will be back and I will try their fish and chips.   Service was good and the prices for what we had were consistent with 2021 inflation prices. I am sure this would be the place to be when a soccer game was on.   Music playing on their sound system was very good too."

This definitely brought me back to my Navy days of Portsmouth and London Pub style fish and chips! Perfectly battered and fried with that nice light crunch when you bite into it. The buffalo cauliflower bites was a first time try for me also. All vegetables need too be made this way. Not too spicy but just right.  This was a takeout order and everything was still hot and crispy when I got home. Perfect spot for any occasion."

                "description": "As a Brit in Austin, after moving here and finally settling in, naturally the next step was the go on a hunt for good British grub in search of a slice of home. I came across the Fort Kenney Pub in Yelp and knew that the following Saturday would start with a fry up!  When we walked in, the staff were all super friendly and welcoming. It wasn't busy as it was still early but there was plenty of seating and the football could be seen from most of them.  The food was great and everything I had hoped for! I subbed black pudding for an extra sausage which our server was more than happy to do. The sausages were really delicious!  Really enjoyed spending my Saturday morning here eating a yummy breakfast. I would love to come back to try some of the other meals on the menu!"

Very friendly and attentive service. We will definitely be back."

                "description": "The food is fantastic! We've been to the UK several times and this is authentic to what we get there.  The restaurant itself is a bit warehouse ish. I feel like they could have done better to give it a pub feel. It feels nothing like a pub which was disappointing.  I'm docking one star for the Pimm's Cup. It's made with that awful soda machine Minute Laud Lemonade. It was horrendous! That was all I could taste. Simple syrup and Minute Made Lemonade.  I also docked a star for the music. It was SO LOUD. My husband and I couldn't talk. Literally. Couldn't hear each other. We were starting to question whether we're hitting an age where we say things like \"the music is too loud\", but no. No no no. This was freaking ridiculous! They had a lady there playing it for an hour before she started what I think was a quiz or game. Music should add ambiance. This felt like we were sitting front row at a concert. It was insanity. To the point I'm totally okay removing a star because of it.  We'll probably go back for the food, but if we're in the mood for a cocktail, or conversation, it won't be high on our list."

                "description": "We've ordered from here a few times and quality of food and service is usually good. Today we got the burger, side salad, and chicken tika. Burger didn't come on pretzel bun like usual and meat was basically raw. Side salad was a generous portion but the cucumbers were moldy. Chicken Tika was awful. Looked like freezer bag pre cooked and seasoned chicken, dry and tasteless without the sauce. Rice was soggy mushy, clearly too much water in rice cooker when it was made. Bread that came with the tika had a yellow gel slime. Going to get people sick or worse serving up food like that.. When I called to let them know about the bad produce two different people took attitude with me about it, poor customer service. As someone that works in the food service industry I'm disappointed. Will not return or recommend to anyone."

                "description": "Today, on this lazy, rainy, gloomy, post-#AustinBlizzard2021 Sunday, Hubs and I were on the hunt for some true comfort food! Thus, we knew that crossing the proverbial pond was a must! This is how we found ourselves at Kenney Fort Pub. Can I just say, y'all, that what we had here was just what we needed? This is true English pub food, and it warmed the very cockles of our very recently frigid hearts!   Hubby went with the English Breakfast! As he was wolfing it down, he looked up at me with an actual sparkle in his eyes, and he said, \"Do you know what this reminds me of most recently, honey?\", and I said, \"Yep!\"! I knew right away that he was referring to that Irish Breakfast that he got at the military part of the airport in Shannon, Ireland, on the way to his too long deployment in Afghanistan in 2018! The picture that he sent me on WhatsApp of that breakfast in that airport is burned in my memory forever!   I went with the Sunday Roast, and it was bloody fantastic, as well! The picture tells the whole story! So good! Chris ate 3/4ths of it, which is our usual division of restaurant food, but I just loved everything about it! The horseradish sauce was MAGIC! I could bathe in it!   We ended with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and damn, y'all! Just damn!  Bottom line: if you've never tasted either of these traditional plates across the pond, but you're the sort that likes little tastes of many things, both of these dishes will be RIGHT up your alley!   And, even if you're not down for little tastes of many things, you'll absolutely wax poetic about that pudding!   What a fantastic find!   p.s. Our server was Noah, and he was a gem!"

                "description": "A solid 4 star experience!  I loved the fish (the chips were ok!). The burger was smokey and the meat was fresh. The fries that came with the burger were tasty. Everything was well seasoned. The kids fish and chips was great and my 5 year old ate it up.   I did not like the tikka masala. It was not creamy and felt heavy on the cumin. It was a smaller portion and not very much sauce. This was the only dish I didn't care for.     Also, when you pack up a to go order, please package the naan separate from thee sauce. It was packed together and the naan was all covered in the sauce that I didn't like so I didn't eat that either.    They need clearer instructions on what their pickup curbside process is. It was a little confusing but we just called and the man who answered brought our food out.  Maybe we were supposed to go get it inside?  I don't know.    I'm glad Kenney Fort Pub is in our neighborhood. I am sure  that we will be ordering curbside from them frequently."

I feel they either put an Texas flare or their own take on what British food taste like.    The burger was good, you  can't really mess up a burger.. well, maybe. The banger and mash, yall.... no. It tasted like a warmed up Slim Jim, the mashed potatoes had an odd flavor that none of could place. Maybe the mustard?  The staff was very helpful but it kinda sucked I couldn't even get a paper menu, my QR reader wasn't working on my phone.   I'll give it another try but will definitely not get B and M again!"

                "description": "Can't believe I haven't written a review here yet.  I went out of my way to get here. Was so looking forward to eating real British food.   I was going to be out this way during my first vaccine shot at Dell Diamond.  It was around lunch that I arrived here.  Waited a short time until they opened. Yes, I was the first one there.  First stop was to the loo.  Yes, it was labeled Loo. Started off with an order of iced tea.  Sorry, Brits no hot tea on a hot day. I asked the server if I could possible try the Black pudding they serve with breakfast. Turns out the server was one of the owner. So I got a slice. Ordered up a Scottish Egg and a plate of Bangers and mash.  I have had Scottish eggs before. These were a bit different because they used British sausage.   British sausage is very much leaner than US sausage.  The sausage meat surrounding the soft boiled egg was denser.  And it was served with picalilli (British salsa).  Loved these starters. Next up the bangers and mash and a slice of black pudding. Had to try the black pudding first.  Trust me it is not a pudding but a blood, oatmeal, pork fat, spices sausage. Before you turn your nose up, try it. A little nibble and interesting flavor. Bigger bite and it was good, before I knew it I finished it off and wish I had more. The banger was a Cumberland made sausage.  Lean pork shoulder meat makes it different than US sausages. Once you get over the difference, It is really good. But the mash potatoes, oh wow. They add mustard and cheddar cheese to theirs. Next batch of mash, I plan on adding mustard to mine. Now if that isn't enough, Red Onion gravy.  Take a slice of sausage, dip into the mash and make sure you have the gravy on it.... Prefect bite. I keep thinking the next time I go, I will get the fish and chips. But as I am writing this, all I can think about is the Bangers and Mash."

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

I'm totally ok with sitting outside with my dog since you have a kitchen but man at least buy an awning or umbrellas or something. 4 random picnic tables thrown outside with no shade is an afterthought."

It's mostly wood picnic tables. There's one table that has chairs with backs and there are a few counter height chairs with backs. I love to hang out and linger at a coffee shop. This has the space, but it's just not comfortable. Adding  some cozy areas would make this place off the charts amazing."

                "description": "This is such a cool place! I planned an outing in Cedar Park with a group of my girlfriends. After our outing at the Ecuadorian chocolate factory, we needed a place that could accommodate a fairly large group of friends during lunch time on a Friday (a task that seemed.... yikes). I am very thankful I stumbled across The Good Lot on Yelp! I reached out to make sure The Good Lot could accommodate us, and they said \"Of Course\" and let me know that all of the trucks would be out on Friday.    When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find several open food trucks and a large building (see, beer bar). People had their dogs outside and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   Between all of us, we tried every food truck. I personally got Four Brothers Venezuelan Kitchen. I am a sucker for good Venezuelan food. I got a Pulled pork Bowl with extra garlic sauce, black beans, avocado, sweet plantains, and all the fixings. I would definitely eat here again. I tried a few samples from other food trucks as well.   Everyone left super happy. This is a great place to go if you have a casual group looking for a quick bite and place to hang out.    The next day (Saturday), I swung by the dog park across the street and stopped by again for lunch on my way home. They have trivia nights, live music over the weekends, and happy hour all day on Monday. Please build another location close to Fort Hood. A copy and paste of exactly what you already created would be great. ;). I promise to stop by weekly."

                "description": "I made the drive up to Cedar Park and my friend was excited to take me here as it had just opened up and seemed to add a streak of cool to my friend's new neighborhood. So, it was midweek around 8pm and while the patio had plenty of folks and there was music going the food trucks were done and they weren't too courteous about letting it be known they were closed or out of food or closing up.   So, the taps were open which allowed me to try out a beer. The staff pouring were definitely friendly, letting me know some of their personal favorites on tap as well as letting me try some out. I did also appreciate that they had some NA options as well and I liked the kombucha they had on tap so much I had two more of those instead of the more adult beverage options they had.  If there was a way to have some of the bar staff cross train with the food truck staff it would make a huge improvement."

                "description": "The Good Lot is a wonderful addition to the CP area. Bring your kiddos and your hounds sit outside under the shade or on their covered patio.    Cocktails anyone? I was surprised at their expansive craft beer options. Check out their rotating taps at: https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/drinks/  There are wine, seltzer, and non-acholohol options as well.  When we visited there were 3 food truck options; Yard Bird, Oink, and our favorite The Rice is Right.    Be aware on weekends and when there is live music parking will be a challenge. This has been a point of contention with the neighbors and according to the Good Lot, they are looking to expand the parking area.    Pro tip: Don't park in the adjoining neighborhood park 5 minutes away at the Veterans Memorial Park. Stretch your legs on the way there and work off that beer on the way back."

                "description": "As far as I can tell, The Good Lot only has 5 star reviews and for good reason.  It is a great beer garden with plenty of non-beer options as well.  I have always passed by the place and noticed how busy it is most weeknights and especially weekends, but I am certainly pleased with what it brings to the community.  Generally it gets pretty busy after 6PM until close, and parking can be difficult to find.  Carpooling or taking a rideshare would be the best way to do it in my opinion as I would hate to park in front of someone else's house in the nice neighborhoods nearby.  Certainly a parking lot expansion is something the owners are considering as that is my only issue with the place especially when it gets busy.  That being said, it is always a great atmosphere with a variety of food and drink options.  There are also always lots of dogs in the grassy area by the patio and it is nice to see how family-friendly the place is.  I will certainly be back and bring some friends in the future!"

                "description": "My daughter and I visited The Good Lot yesterday (8/8/21).  It's the new and hot food truck and bar spot in Cedar Park TX (2500 W New Hope). The Good Lot has a main building with a large dining area enclosed by glass garage doors that open and a bar that has numerous beers, ales, ciders, and craft sodas.  It's nestled among the oak trees. There is a nice amount of paved parking and gravel lot parking.   The Good Lot also has dining areas under the oaks along with a game area (corn hole) and a playground for the kids with a large wooden teepee for climbing.  They are dog friendly.   The Good Lot had 4 food trucks.  We chose The Rice Is Right that serves Korean inspired rice boxes and other items.  We ordered the crispy chicken box and the cauliflower box.  Both items were perfectly fried and coated in a sweet and spicy Korean sauce.  Flavor was amazing.  The boxes came with steamed white rice and a purple cabbage slaw.  The portions were large and more than enough food for us. There were other food trucks that served Mediterranean, Pork, and Chicken.  The menus look good and I will explore those in the future.  The Good Lot and The Rice Is Right are on 'My Keepers List'."

What a wonderful experience. There was a variety of beers on tap and nice small selection of wine by the glass. The food was outstanding. Most importantly the environment and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional.   During our visit we met the owners and their family and it was truly an enjoyable experience. Playing corn hole and chatting with the family was outstanding. Neil and his wife are fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy and afternoon or evening there. I think you will enjoy it."

Food trailers here, beer on tap, covered patio, great outdoor seats and space, place for kids and pets. It has only been open for 3 weeks and the word is getting out. As we were leaving tonight, the park lot was pretty full. Great place to relax with buddies after work or with the family with a wooden teepee for the kids to climb and corn hole. Head over to The Good Lot and get some food from The Rice is Right and Oink Mobile."

The beer selection was great, lots of locals including Whitestone, Hedgehog, Red Horn, Family Brewing and (of course) some lovely PHP Jellyfish on tap.  We decided to tried Yaadbird, since we hadn't had any fried chicken in a while. The lemon pepper chicken was on point, crispy, juicy, peppery, a 'lil salty, and everything you need in your fried chicken!  The property is beautiful and well landscaped. The lawn was amazing! It was so fluffy! When we first arrived we just admired the live oak trees and the quality of the grass.. Lawn lovers, you will understand...  The bartenders were very nice and very excited to introduce so many new people to the Good Lot. The owner was all over the bar, pouring drinks, helping staff, and checking with guests, seeming to have time for everyone.  We are looking forward to coming back here and trying the 3 other food trucks, along with the rotating beer menu. Hope they are planning to host more events, as we would love to do an anniversary party here at some point!"

                "description": "Finally, a really great beer garden in Cedar Park. I came on their first \"soft public open\" day and I'm so glad I did. I've been to about 20 pubs and bars in CP and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's an open air (no AC but there is heat in the winter) with big garage doors that were open and a huge ceiling fan so it was comfortable. There were about 20 taps and 3 of them were not filled yet. I chatted with the owner and she said she was looking for ideas so my friend Greg gave her some. :)  There is plenty of indoor seating. Plus, there is a huge grassy area with picnic tables and even a fire pit. It's family-friendly so no smoking.  There is a playground for the kids and spots for four food trucks although only two were filled.   Beer was about $6 on average so not cheap but not expensive either. $1 off all day on Mondays.   It was an enjoyable experience and a really great ambience. I'll definitely be back!"

This place is non-smoking, dog-friendly (leashed) and kid-friendly, with a unique play area, six sets of cornhole, and plenty of shaded grassy area to run around in. Tables are wide and comfortable, and the entire patio was open-air, so social distancing is a breeze. We ate at the Oinkmobile truck (delicious) and grabbed local beers and ciders at the patio desk. We walked the fifteen minutes from our house, but it looks like they have a decent-sized parking lot and are working on creating more space. The only downside is that there's no ramp down to the grass/play area, but hopefully they'll make it more accessible in the future. Staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to come back for open mic night. Because yes, we'll be back!!"

Huge outdoor space with picnic tables plastic chairs or plenty of room to bring your own (even saw someone bring their own folding table). Live music was at just the right volume playing just the right kind of classic rock that doesn't offend and always pleases. Beer selection was generous and reasonably priced (not to mention $5 glasses of wine). Had a 50/50 burger at Oink and was BLOWN away. It's half bacon and half beef and all good. Loved it. The bacon Mac and cheese was also delicious but the portion was a little small for $9 (my only complaint of the night). Do yourself a favor and if you're up in the 613 check this place out!!!"

Once we got a drink, we were lucky enough to snag a table under the fans and the breeze was so nice. They had live music while we were there, which I believe will continue on weekends so that's fun. The lawn looked so nice, chairs to sit in, trees for shade, lawn games for entertainment! There were 4 or 5 food truck options while we were there and while we didn't get any food, all the food we saw coming out looked so good! Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"

For the owners- they may have different names other places- it's a ziploc bag with water and you put coins in and hang them. If you Google penny bag it will tell you they avoid them because it's bright (thanks Matt for googling!) but I like to think it looks like a spider web to fly eyeballs so they are trying to stay away from a web.

We drive a jeep so we had no issues ... live music and plenty of smiling faces.. service was great, bathrooms were clean... dogs welcome! Plenty of good beers, wines and ciders... gals were so nice behind the bar.. offered samples and were super sweet... good folks, good music and good grub.... my son joined us and grabbed some food from the food trucks... cauliflower wings, shrimp fried rice and macaroni and cheese... so so good.... bring your chairs/ blanket to sit on because tables and chairs are hard to snag... the lines are long for drinks but they go fast.... We will be back for sure! We feel right at home here. If you like fresh air and freedom... come here.. if you are afraid of fresh air and human contact, probably should go to Austin and be amongst others who feel that way... Merica!"

Anyway, cannot comment too much on food as we only had an appetizer and it was alright.   Beer and wine are served in a plastic now which is less than desirable. Not sure how it was pre-Covid.   Staff was fast and efficient but I don't think I could describe them as warm or friendly.  They weren't rude either.   Decent amount of variety. It's charm is that is local and has the hole in the wall personality.   We plan on returning."

                "description": "My review is mostly based on service.  I came here with the husband on a Monday night because I wanted a post-dinner beer. I marked this place in my bookmarks as a place I wanted to try based off the reviews. I generally try to be open-minded about my experiences at new places, but honestly I was just rubbed the wrong way here. We walked inside around 7 pm and I only noticed the list of cocktails on the wall behind the bar. I looked at the tap handles to see if I could tell what they had and the bartender finally came over. I figured I'd ask for something easy and see if they had Dos Equis on draft and was told they didn't with a snarky attitude that I guess he thought was witty or funny. I asked where the list of beers was and he stared at me and just pointed up...ok where am I supposed to be looking? OH. Apparently I'm supposed to know there are individual beer names hanging not only above the bar seats, but also sticking out slightly over the seating where you have to get up to see them. I tell him I haven't been there before and wouldn't know those were there. I order the beer he suggested (Alstadt Kölsch) based off of me asking for Dos Equis. He asks if I want to open a tab and I say no. His response: \"Only one beer?\" with what may as well have been an eye roll. You would think with me telling someone that I'm a new patron the attitude would be better. He probably doesn't care since A) it probably isn't his business, B) I'm sure they have regulars and C) he was probably in a hurry to come outside to vape with his friends on the patio that says \"No Smoking\".  Side note: if you want to sit outside be prepared to listen to cornhole games underneath the same covering as the seating which causes it to echo so loud you can't hear your own conversation."

                "description": "On this past Saturday, we made the adult decision to venture out as LB was open. We decided to visit as they were not busy and were following the separation guidelines. The service is always friendly and it was even better on this visit. Our guest puppy was treated to snacks and fresh water. We sat on the covered patio and watched rerun sporting events and just enjoyed being outside.   I've been an LB patron since day 1 and I remember when it was difficult to find a local venue that offered a large variety of craft beer options.  LB has changed a lot of the years as they now serve cocktails and their patio has been expanded. Venues come and go (see Sheas and AJs across the street) but LB has a loyal following and has remained our go-to venue to have a brew or two and some pub grub.   It's a misnomer to call their food pub grub as you can order a pretty darn good pizza, meatball casserole, fried calamari, artichoke dip, or our favorite their homemade fried pickles. Yes, they pickle on site!   Nice folks, great beer, good cocktails (check out their specials), and food."

The hurricane that I order that was off of there board on drinks that they made was not a good drink.   The garlic bread we ordered was overdone and almost fully burnt on the bottom.   We ordered pizza also. One side was barely done while the other side was burnt. They put a lot of Italian season on top the pizza after it was cooked. Some times you just get a bite full of seasoning, not good.  First bits we thought the pizza had a good flavor but the more you ate the pizza the less tasty it was."

                "description": "Seek and ye shall find. This tiny hidden spot in old Leander checks off lots of my boxes - but doesn't impress. First off. This is a nice place dont get me wrong. I have been 3 times now just to see maybe it was an OFF day. Good menu , sports , decent tunes. So - those are pretty solid. Let me start with the menu. Pub grub for the most part with $10 pizzas unlimited toppings. So- naturally this is what i ordered each time. Each time it comes out it looks amazing and I'm excited. Like a Pointer Sister ( I 'm so excited ) . But the pizza never tastes cooked. The dough is mushy. Not a big deal. NExt time around I tell them to leave it in a bit longer for me. Comes out -- same. Not a deal breaker. Just need to change what I am eating. My belly prob says same thing. Next lets move onto the staff. For the most part the lady running the joint is on point. Friendly- helpful and witty. The remainder of the staff is quite the opposite. I have noticed this during a lunch visit with us being one of 2 people in the place, and in the evenings like during the sports games and crowds. Just abrasive . Again- I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to have a cold beer ( maybe 3) watch baseball or the slew of people who still have to think if they need to be wearing a mask when they enter an establishment( smh). So - The beer. They have a pretty typical tap list with 1-2 silver and gold medal choices. I saw Aldelberts there last night.. sweet!. But behind the bar is a ghostbuster lunchbox treasure chest of cans and bottles. WARNING! don't try to figure out what's in there. Hard to see them all... and after learning  how friendly the bar staff(see above ) is - I gave up asking and went with an IPA. The crowds are not bad and for the most part follow distancing rules.. but - nothing enforced. This scares me. While I know its MY choice to patron , I would still like to see ppl adhere to the 6ft. Outside- good seating - tv;s good parking and over all fantastic. I will prob go back, just not order the pizza and maybe try and get a spy camera behind the bar to see the other options as -- that's what life is all about. Options. Thanks for eating with me today, and I'll see you next time.  -M"

Sat down at the bar and asked to move because a regular sits there. Ok fine. Told the game was on a certain TV. Once people started arriving the manager said she didn't have enough boxes to play the game I wanted all of a sudden. We had ubered to the bar and now are forced to leave. I guess there is a hierarchy in customers and you have to be important to be treated well. I'm baffled."

This was the second night in a row that I was ignored while sitting at the bar and watching the bar tender hang at the end of the bar with is buddies.   What was once a nice calm place to eat and enjoy some craft beers is now a place for the high volume drinking and the vocally high volume people.

The raw oysters are always my favorite to snack on (tip: on Mondays, their gulf oysters are only $1). I've also tried their chowda fries which are delicious. It's everything you would expect with chowder but better because you also get fries (this dish itself can be heavy and filling). Definitely one to try if you're looking for something to warm your soul. Their lobster roll is good too. I love the lobster meat but I wish they served it as a warm, hot sandwich rather than the chilled one. Nonetheless, still delicious!   Now don't get me started on their dessert which is also worth noting here. All their desserts are made in-house but there is one that really hits the spot. This dessert has a warm chocolate brownie topped with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. If heaven was a dish, that would be it because it just transports you into another world. Worth saving some room in your stomach for!"

I had a half-dozen gulf oysters which were very small, and also had the shrimp and grits which was just over complicated. The shrimp was overcooked as you would expect someplace hundreds of miles from the coast where no one knows anything about seafood, and the dish was overall just rich and higher-flown than necessary.  D had something else for a main dish that neither of us even remembers, and she also had the mac and cheese which was tasty but also a little over-produced.  Neither of us would consider returning. Third star is because the service was good - Kevin was our server - otherwise, and this this is just OUR opinion as lifetime gulf coast residents, maybe two stars."

The shrimp were luscious and delicious and it was a huge portion. Service is always amazing and they've upgraded their HVAC system so I feel comfortable dining here."

                "description": "We found ourselves in Round Rock, TX on a recent Saturday, early evening, so we decided to stop by Salt Traders Costal Cooking on IH 35.  We found a couple of open seats at the bar.  Our first orders were a couple of craft cocktails, the Gin and Housemaid Tonic and The Rum Around.  Both were good, but upon reflection, for the price, regular cocktails would have sufficed.    We kind of went crazy on appetizers, having Gulf oysters, grilled oysters, crab fingers, and the crudo plate, which was yellowfin.  All of those dishes were \"off the chart\" crazy good, with the exception of the crudo ... the white sauce used was way too sweet for the awesome fish.    When we finally ended up at the main section of the menu, we ordered the fried oyster lettuce wraps and the simply grilled fish of the day, which was redfish.  The tartar sauce served with the lettuce wraps was delicious, but a bit too much was slathered on the wraps.  IMHO put a dash on the lettuce leaves and let the patron add as desired from the small cup of tartar sauce that comes with the dish.  The redfish was terrific, but no one knew why the place would have farm-raised redfish from the Indian Ocean when we have fresh redfish 200 miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?    Keeping it local, we ordered the Becker Vineyard Reserve Viognier, and it was delicious.  In closing, a special shout out to our waiter Nathan behind the bar, service was attentive but not intrusive, so nice to have a great waiter with a great attitude!"

                "description": "We've been a fan of Salt Trader's Costal Cooking in RR since their opening five years ago and not surprisingly we dine there 2-1 over Jack Allen's, our previous go-to place. We've never had a less than wonderful experience there with the diverse menu and bold bright flavors and textures of amazingly prepared seafood and American cuisine and wonderful drinks.  The newly transformed Flat Top Fish Tacos are unbelievably good as the two hearty tacos are prepared Birria style with caramelized cheese crust on the flour tortilla and with substantial amount of grilled black drum with a street corn filling along with the cup of aromatic tomato-shrimp soppin broth and tomatillo-lime rice with pickled chilis.   Other favorites include Grilled Oysters and Fried Oyster Lettuce Wraps for Starters and the  Fish Enchiladas and of course fresh Oysters and Daily Specials and Seasonal Deserts.  FLAT TOP FISH TACOS 17 crispy cheese flour tortilla, street corn,  tomatillo lime rice, pickled chilis,  charred tomato-shrimp soppin' broth"

Although, the wait isn't too bad  Food: I got a very basic meal( lol), I got the the fried fish and shrimp and was not disappointed  Honorable mention: tried the New Orleans bbq shrimp and the pasta- i wasn't a huge fan- my taste buds said it was too salty foe me- but my friend enjoyed them  Drinks: i really wanted a spicy margarita and Hannah made sure that she got it to my liking, which I truly appreciated!"

                "description": "Salt Traders might be my favorite upscale casual restaurant in Round Rock. The vibe here is similar to Jack Allen's, but with a nautical twist. 100% the kind of place where you'll find at least one dude rocking salmon colored shorts and boat shoes. No shade, just facts.  I particularly love their happy hour. All the appetizers are hits (especially the chowder fries), and that $4 discount on apps is really nice. I may be wrong, but I think on either Monday or Tuesday, happy hour is basically all day. If you've never been and want to sample a bunch of things, definitely take advantage of this.  My favorite entree by far is the shrimp and grits. It comes with a savory sauce on top that really sets it apart from other places. The bowl is also huge, and so the price is more than justified. I'm particularly fond of the Bonnabel -- one of my favorite whiskey cocktails ever. Just sweet enough for a guy like me who can't drive a manual, but just whiskey forward enough that it doesn't look like I own a Fiat.   The place gets super busy at the usual dinner times and all times during the weekend. Be a pro and hit them up during slow hours for the best experience!"

North Round Rock really isn't the place you'd think of for high quality seafood and a great classy bar scene, but that's exactly what this place had.  My wife had the scallops and they were seared perfectly and tender in the middle. Couldn't ask for better.  I had a fish sandwich, but I'm picky so I did it without the slaw, which was a mistake because it needed the crunch and the sauce. I'm sure it would be a 10/10 with that.  Definitely go to this place. We were treated like gold and the food was excellent!"

                "description": "This is my second time here in the last couple years. I started with the gumbo. In my personal opinion it was under seasoned. Kind of bland. I then had the New Orleans Shrimp. Very nice. You can tell the shrimp are fresh. I then proceeded on to the Shrimp and Lobster roll. The roll was fantastic! Warm, fresh, toast yet pillowy on the inside. The Shrimp and Lobster salad was nice and cold. The shrimp burst with flavor and freshness.  My server, (Scott) was elusive to say the least. The other waiters attended to me a lot more than he did. I probably waited 8-10 minutes before he took my order. The restaraunt was probably at 30% capacity at most. I had multiple managers see me looking for my waiter and just walked on by.   Overall, the food is good and they can definitely improve on service. I understand being shorthanded, but some things are inexcusable."

My husband and I arrived in the early side, during happy hour (3:30-6:30 on a Thursday), so we could enjoy a leisurely meal. We started with drinks. I had the frozen grapefruit margarita, which tasted like a regular margarita. I loved that the salt on the glass also had citrus peel.  Our appetizer ($5 off during happy hour) was pot stickers. They were excellent, and the portion size (6) just right for sharing. The sauce was wonderful.   I ordered one of the day's specials for dinner, seared monkfish. It was served over fingerling potatoes and topped with a great salsa. The monkfish was tasty  but a bit on the chewy side... and the potatoes were barely undercooked. My husband had fish and chips, always a good choice at Salt Traders.  Dessert was vanilla creme brulee topped with peach sorbet. Excellent!   Service was excellent. We enjoyed Patrick's sense of humor and the stories he told.   We will be back again, without a doubt!"

Given that it's by the people behind Jack Allen's, Salt Trader typically gives you a small portion of their Salmon dip to welcome you.   This place is always packed, especially on Mondays when it's all day HH. If you plan on coming on Monday, definitely get a reservation or you might be waiting ~1 hour.   I've had a number of their appetizers and they're all super tasty. My favorite is definitely the fish collar. Nicely seasoned with Cajun spice and the perfect amount of crisp. You can't really go wrong with any of their entree either.   All in all, solid restaurant that I would go to again and again."

We enjoyed a variety of fresh oysters as an appetizer and then ordered a second round! Super selection so we had to try most all of them  Entrees included the fabulous monkfish special and my absolute favorite, the ciopino! I thought about the monkfish but just had to stay with my favorite, which was soooo yummy as always.  I have to give a shout out to our server, 'Hanna from Louisiana.' She was SUPER! Kept us entertained and was a great representative of the Jack Allen family-knowledgeable, super friendly and totally dedicated to delivering an exceptional guest experience. She is 5 stars for sure.  In summary, we just love love love Salt Traders!!"

We made our reservation a couple of days in advance and the only available time slots left were 4:30 and 8:30pm. We decided to do an early dinner and IT. WAS. SO. GOOD.   We got the 2 dozen chargrilled oysters, 2 dozen seasonal oysters, chowder fries. Presentation, portion, and service was great! Our waitress Hannah was attentive and very sweet! I'm not a huge oyster fan, but these were phenomenal! Between the four of us, we cleaned house and walked out with our appetites satisfied. Afterwards, we walked off our fully bellies at the outlet mall!"

It was very light, fresh, and not sweet. (Some places add a lot of sugar to their pasta sauce not Tony C's).

Nearby, newly-opened LaQuinta Hotel's guests , including sports teams, families, conference attendees, and other large parties, will love coming here, not just for the seating and atmosphere, BUT FOR THE PIZZA!!!

We ordered the chicken Parmesan pizza as recommended by our cashier and an order of garlic knots. It was a great recommendation.   The garlic knots came out first. They were so warm, soft and garlic buttery! They came with their house made marinara, which was sooo good! Those poor garlic knots were gone just as quick as they arrived.  When the pizza came out, it looked amazing but I was a little concerned the chicken Parmesan might be a bit dry because it kind of looked that way. Let me tell you, the pizza was spot on! The chicken was well seasoned and cooked, definitely not dry. The crust on the pizza was amazing!!! I'm craving it again as I write this review!  The atmosphere was also laid back. They had beautiful wood bench seating, which could accommodate a large party/gathering if the place is not to busy. Service was also excellent.  Honestly, the best pizza I've had in a while! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for delicious pizza!"

Ordering online and pick up is easy! I scheduled my pick up order in advance so I wouldn't forget.  Food was delicious. No complaints. Really enjoyed the sauce that came with the garlic knots and calamari. Gelato was satisfying. Looking forward to trying another pizza soon!"

                "description": "My husband is a pizza snob. Seriously. The staff here recognizes us now. I would say that's a pretty good sign that we go here often.  Here's what I don't like about this place: cheap, thin napkins and stingy thin plates. Also, If you have unwrapped straws, please buy a dispenser for it. It's really not sanitary in the first place, but with COVID, can you purchase wrapped straws please? I do appreciate the conscious effort to recycle. Please ditch the cheap paper goods and maybe use reusable metal pizza pans for plates or something. Also, I don't think I ever see lids for the cups. Again, perhaps consider plastic reusable cups.  What we do like: mozzarella sticks, pizza rolls, THE PIZZA, did I mention the mozzarella sticks ;) I don't like them trying to upsell ranch, but I get it. Also like the availability of pizza boxes for leftover pizza and lids for sauces.  We'll be back. Don't worry about my 4 star rating and comments about the paper goods. If we lived closer, I wouldn't insist on dining in."

Pepperoni is my fav but I had to get the motz, basil and tomato on the margarita pizza.

                "description": "We were starving so the pizza isn't full and a picture of the fried ravioli is absent. My boyfriend and I had a great time at the the new local pizza joint. We shared the largest size pizza, split a fried ravioli app, and gelato. We also enjoyed a few drinks on HH.  We usually go to slapbox for local pizza, but dare I say it, this place has better pizza in my opinion! Not as greasy and it's closer to us. Their HH runs from 5-7. My boyfriend got 2 October fest beers and I had a glass of PG, a frozen bellini and a sangria, which were all $2-3 off depending on the drink. The frozen bellini was very good and I don't normally drink frozen drinks. I did not care for the sangria at all, though.   Everyone was very friendly. In regards to COVID, everything was very clean from what I saw.   Shoutout to the manager, Catalina! She was very genuine in her table checks and we both believe she's a great asset to their team in QC."

We also orders the garlic knots which were also fantastic but look more like cinnamon rolls than garlic knots. Then, we tried the vanilla, chocolate and strawberry gelato. The vanilla is more of a rich vanilla bean flavor so it's an acquired taste (my husband loved it, I didn't care for it)  my daughter loved the chocolate (said it was better than Baskin-Robbins) and I had the strawberry. The strawberry was so delicious. Sweet, soft and airy with the perfect amount of tart to it. The restaurant was industrial looking, open concept and very clean. All the staff were friendly and attentive. Wish we had one of these where we live!"

Service was great, place was clean, and they seem to be taking COVID restrictions seriously.   The pizza was pretty good. Not as good as Slapbox/600 Degrees but just a notch below (on par with Pinthouse). Came out quick and was hot. Beer selection was pretty good - had a local brewery Oktoberfest.   All in all, worth returning and will try to nudge my kids into agreeing to go here instead of Hat Creek next door."

Food: we tried the toasted ravioli, garlic knots, Italian chopped salad and pizza. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. While the prices were not cheap, I do think you get a good value for what you pay for.   The only improvement we'd suggest is letting customers open a tab and be able to order both food and drinks on it. We were told they're already working on this though!"

I ordered the 12\" carnivore pizza and it definitely satisfied my cravings. The carnivore has salami, pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, pizza sauce, mozzarella, and calabrian peppers. There were a lot of spices, which made it quite flavorful. If you like meat on meat on meat...this pizza is for you!   Service was great! I went inside, instead of using the curbside option, to pickup the pizza from their takeout counter. They greeted me right away and had my pizza ready on time. I appreciated their organization. The inside of the restaurant looks really cute with long family style tables, TVs, and a warm atmosphere. I look forward to dining in the restaurant next time."

Everyone got pitchers of mimosas but I'm pregnant so not drinking. They all enjoyed them!   All the food that came out looked amazing. I wasn't really feeling anything crazy but the items i got were delicious! The biscuit was fluffy and flakey and everything i wanted.   The sausages were actually huge and so filling. There was a nice flakey crunch to the outside of them which i wasn't expecting but enjoyed. The service was great and so were the portion to cost ratios! Well worth it!"

They were not outright rude, but not very hospitable. Nobody smiled throughout the evening. Definetly did not feel welcome.   I ordered the burger and fries.  It was probably one of the worst burgers I've had.   There needs to be a balance between meat, bread, and veggies.  The burger was under cooked and  too big for the bun.  The veggies were minimal and soaked in blood from the burger.    My wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  That was better, but a mess to eat.    My son had the Mac n cheese with fruit.  The Mac was a thick gooey mess with large elbow pasta. Very hard to spoon out.  Not easy for a 3 year old to eat.  Also, quite salty.   We don't plan on returning."

The brunch food was just average, I think this might be a better spot for dinner. I had a Bloody Mary and it tasted like watery tomato juice with no spice or horseradish. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits - he really liked the shrimp on it but the grits didn't have much flavor. The best item that we had was the appetizer of chips and queso but we subbed fries instead of chips - SO yummy. The queso was spicy and the fries were so crispy.   We would probably go back for dinner and drinks to see if it's better!"

I ordered Shrimp and Grits and she ordered the Full Monty (American sampler)  Our food was all cold nothing hot or remotely warm. They didn't seem too busy so maybe they are working out some expediting issues. My grits were mediocre at best maybe if they were warm that would be different and the shrimp was fishy and rubbery. I've never had grits that were like a smear on the bottom of the bowl/plate but that's exactly what this was.  My daughter said her eggs tasted off and her fruit was clearly on the brink of, if not already spoiled. The best thing on the plate was the potatoes  I'd give them another shot just maybe not for brunch this time."

The good: We were seated quickly and there were quite a few staff in the restaurant to help so we didn't have to really wait that long for anything. In fact, once's we're done my wife said, \"we should start looking for the bill\" and here comes the waitress with the bill. This is really surprising in light of the challenges that other restaurants are having with staffing.   I like that this place is in downtown round rock and I like the overall aesthetic with wood beams on the ceilings and the house converted to restaurant feel.   I got a special off of their hatch chili menu and it was very tasty and a pretty decent sized piece of fish.   The not so good: While the food was tasty, I was missing some of the expected hatch chili flavor that I would expect to find when ordering something off a hatch chili menu  My wife's fish was a little tough, but again the flavor was good  If you get cold easily, make sure to bring a sweater. The temperature was pretty frigid and because of the small floor for the restaurant there wasn't really a way to find a spot where the you don't get blown on by the AC.   Wrap-up: All in all the food and service were good. A few tweaks and I think this could be a 5-star review."

Staff were friendly but noticeably uninterested as some were preoccupied scrolling on their phones and others even hanging out at the bar. Our waitress was at least attentive.   For food I ordered the salmon frittata, and the hubs got the pork belly hash and a $5 orange juice that was clearly brand made and from a bottle that probably cost just as much as the charge of the 8oz we were served. Flavor wise, my food was delicious tho slightly salty. However upon arriving to the table, the pork belly hash looked smaller than my entree. For $16 you'd expect strips of pork belly on top of the sweet potato hash - what you really get is 10% protein, 20% dry biscuit, 30% hash, and 40% arugula garnish. Redeeming quality was the perfectly poached egg.   Definitely a happy hour/small bites spot but wouldn't recommend for brunch or a full meal. For $50, much left to be desired"

What a let down. It was like one thin deli sliced ham on and English muffin with an underdone poached egg and barely any hollandaise. It was more like eating eggs on toast. Now the potatoes; they could've been great. They were fine. But the peppers with the potatoes were not cooked and more thrown in just because. Not only that the music outside was too loud to have a conversation. I wish my experience was better, but mayyyybe I'll try it again with something else on the menu? I don't know."

                "description": "My fiancé, baby and I came here for a nice Friday night on the town. We had heard how great it was and was anxious to check it out for ourselves. Upon checking in we were told there was a 45 minute wait...fair enough. We walked to Finley's to grab a quick drink. We were both surprised when we got a text only within 20 mins! When we came back we were greeted by the hostess who was an absolute doll and showed to our table up front. Let me just say - customer service was top notch. Exactly was we hoped for. Our waiter Chandler was amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the bacon wrapped quail. It was superb. We both enjoyed it very much. For our entrees I had a side Caesar salad and the Dry Aged Ribeye (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake), my fiancé had the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake) and for our 2 year old we ordered a kids meal with Mac and Cheese and Fries.  Let's start with the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop. While it was the tastiest of our entrees it was just a bit slightly overcooked...but delicious despite that. Okay on to the ribeye. I get this is not a steakhouse so I probably shouldn't have ordered it, but I had a craving. For the $45 price tag we were very disappointed. The thin cut steak very under-seasoned. The \"cheddar potato cake\" was just okay...its basically a mound of mashed potatoes with a cheddar crisp on top. The asparagus was okay but I like the small asparagus better and these were ginormous.  I noticed the baby wasn't eating his mac and cheese and wondered why. It looked like it came from a generic box and once I tasted it I learned why. Oddly enough the dish tasted like it had vinegar in it!! My fiancé tasted it and said the same thing. We even let Chandler know when we were leaving."

Reservations for 10 were easy as we called first thing today. They save a great table for us. Very nice touch.   We started with a few apps that was great. The chips and dip was perfect. Everyone loved the main courses and the plates were cleared.   We ate inside but went outside after to listen to the singer for a few songs. We love live music and it is so great to have it back.   Great night with family."

                "description": "First time visiting Urban but decided to check it out on a whim because I was nearby. When I arrived it was happy hour so ordered a cocktail. Called the Passion Project which was delightfully delicious! A bit on the sweet side but yummy nonetheless. It was a cold day so decided on a cup of tortilla soup... unfortunately I was accidentally bought the tomato soup which is pictured as well... I didn't taste it but it smelled delicious. The waitress was kind when I let her know the incorrect soup was brought and quickly brought out the tortilla soup. The soup seasoned well and perfectly warmed however tasted liked chicken soup with tortilla strips. I also ordered the Urban chopped salad with salmon... it was huge! Lol! The salmon was a bit dry and not really flavorful but once chopped over the salad all of the the flavors blended well together. All in all I enjoyed  my time at Urban... the service was fast, staff was friendly, and the overall ambiance was nice! I'd definitely visit again."

                "description": "My daughter and I enjoyed a Saturday brunch at Urban to celebrate her Halloween birthday. We arrived a few minutes ahead of our noon reservation but were seated promptly outdoors and were told our server would be there soon. Then we waited...and waited.    Once our server arrived with waters in hand, things ran more smoothly. My daughter had a full Monte and I had shrimp and grits. The food was attractively plated and tasted great. My shrimp was spicy, and there was plenty of bacon in the dish. The only thing that seemed out of place was the redeye gravy around the edge of the cheesy grits. It really added nothing.   There are plenty of menu choices, including vegetarian and gluten free items. Prices are a bit on the high side for some things and reasonable on others. But the food was good for us so I'd definitely return. This would have been a 5 star review had we not waited so long before a waitperson visited."

Happy hour has $8 bar bites and drink specials. Would visit again! We got the chicken fried steak, pork chop and fried chicken hot sandwich. The hot honey sauce was AMAZING - spice only hits you at the end, and the dishes had the right level of crisp."

                "description": "My wife and along with some friends went to Urban Eats for the first time in a couple years and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. This s not a fancy place but very welcoming and casual. We decided to try the covered outside area and even though it was pretty hot, the fans and breeze made it very comfortable.  We discovered they have a happy hour Tuesday-Saturday which is pretty unusual in my experience. The menu is creative and utilizes locally sourced suppliers and though it is not a huge selection, it is varied, offering some seafood, steak, pork chop, salads, soups and starters. We had  grilled shrimp, quinoa salad, tortilla soup and side salads. Service was very attentive without making us feel rushed. Live music started at 7 which was another pleasant surprise.  We were amazed how much this part of downtown Round Rock has really developed. Parking was easy, the area is very walkable and Main Street entertainment district nearby.  Urban Eats is definitely a repeater for us! Give it a try and support a great local business."

                "description": "Drove by here today and thought I would check it out and I liked it! I ordered a Peacemaker Beer, an ale that tasted good. The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

                "description": "Evening in the suburbs and the dining options were dwindling. I was getting hungry and being out with my buddy meant that I'd have at least one more beer. My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

We stayed long enough to finish our beers and while we were drinking, staff propped the booth bench back together. I disassembled it twice but they kept putting it back.

Lots of good seating both inside and out for  those who want a more open environment. Their pub grub is excellent, Scotch eggs to die for and some really tasty cheese offerings as well as some standard fare. The whole staff is friendly, honestly, never had a grumpy server and I really like sitting on a couch...one of the seating options depending on where in the pub you are.

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.

                "description": "Been checking this place out online for months now and finally got an opportunity to go in person today. Wow. What a superior waste of time! It makes sense now why it was so empty when we went in.  You would think that as we're just coming out of a pandemic, pub and bar owners would be over the top happy to have people show up to eat and drink their food.  Well, not this owner! I'm still in shock how rude he was to me and in so little time of me being there! His bar waitress was super sweet and answering questions as it was our first time there. The plan was to order some grub, and craft beer and go sit outside on the picnic tables on this beautiful Sunday.  I was into my second question about one of the brunch items, when he rudely interjected himself into our conversation by trying to answer my question for the waitress where he clearly had not actually heard my question at all. I then corrected him by repeating what I actually asked. He then tried to defend his ignorance by stating something else about the food they serve that was a complete contradiction to half of the menu items. You should of heard the way this guy talked to me, there was absolutely no reason for it, completely unwarranted.  Plus he made himself look like a total idiot in front of everyone and it was so obvious. The more obvious thing was that he didn't want our business. When I say our, it was my husband, 2 yr. old and me. Maybe he felt threatened by our kid? He wasn't misbehaving or doing anything crazy. The nice waitress was chatting with him and everything was totally fine. And then out of no where the owner was just a total dick to me!! So of course we left, I mean who would stay!? But that's exactly what he wanted, for us to leave. With pleasure, Asshole!  I felt bad for the nice waitress, she seemed to be in shock also. Sure hope she finds somewhere else to work since I can bet she gets treated like garbage.  Funny thing is that I can't even comment on the food or beer which is all I was yes to try. This guy should do the world a favor, sell the place to someone who actually wants business and go take a class in The Important of People skills in the food and bev business. Mean people suck and they need to learn how to be nice or just grow the F up."

                "description": "First of all, not family friendly. Took my daughter here for a dinner with our dog ... sat outside, and ordered a couple of burgers, and after a long day I wanted a couple of cold, craft beers. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected a family friendly atmosphere, but I honestly didn't think I had to think it through too much. So, a group of men in their 30s-40s began arguing about a patron sneezing , dropping \"f bombs\". The patron went in to get the owner. I thought \"ok cool, the owner will take care of this.\" Instead, of calming the situation, he comes out dropping \"f bombs\" of his own, bragging about how he's going to kick all their asses, and how big of a Texan he is. I asked if he could watch his language in front of my family, he ignored me. So, I took it as a way to teach my daughter that this is the definition of a bunch of men that are nothing but losers. I told her, this is not the way men that have any class should act in public. There were also plenty of other women around that didn't need to hear all of this male drama while they are trying to have an enjoyable evening with their families. The guy that actually started the whole thing apologized. Owner, Eric, you should be ashamed of yourself. Dude, have some awareness ... no one cares about how cool and tough you think you are while they are trying to have dinner and spend some time with their friends and family. The people next to me just got up and left, too. You were so caught up in your own ego, you didn't even notice. I spent $42 and still left your staff a 20% tip, mostly cuz I felt sorry they have to work for such a loser. Not sure what Texas you claim to have grown up in, but not the one my family has lived in for 6+ generations. We all make mistakes .. and I rarely leave reviews or waste any of my precious time on this kinda thing .. but this needed to be said."

Lunch was solid service was good but I think that was partially because there were only 4 tables occupied when we were there but the service was attentive.  Menu is pretty large and has breakfast items during lunch so no complaints there because I do love me some breakfast for lunch or dinner.  Overall solid place would come back if I'm in the area not making a special trip here but if I'm here I definitely would come back."

The Sunday crew in the bar was super fun, our server Aaron was really kind   Their Sunday drink special is $3 mimosa and bloody Mary's.   Their gluten free bun is the best I've had at a restaurant, it is nice and chewy and stays together.   The chicken sandwich was great, a huge chicken breast with lots of bacon and avocado. They do a \"first timer\" complimentary dessert of their chocolate dump cake, my husband said it was great!"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place. Will come back for dinner to try more of the menu."

                "description": "The League is part neighborhood bar, part gastro-pub and I love both parts!    The bar and dinning areas are separated.  Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

As a former restaurant owner / operator, I appreciate the consistency and quality of the menu offerings. The facility is always clean and tables are cleared immediately when a party leaves. They have some really good deals, like burger Monday where you buy one and get one free. They also have a mouth watering prime rib special on Thursday that we can't wait to try.  One more attraction is , if you are into science or astronomy, you might be waited on by Galileo."

Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

Arron the bartender jumps in to help out in the dining area. Great guy !! Food : Pot pie (basically a biscuit with gravy with a fried egg on top - WOW filling and Delicious!! Wife had the steak salad - steak cooked exactly as she ordered it.  Mother in Law had a breakfast anytime.  All of our food was delicious!!  All and All we had a GREAT experience!!

I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

Fish n chips are AOK there are better fish n chips in the area but you can easily split this bountiful dish.   The League pours a good cocktail and their bloodies, according to Plus 1, are right up there with the best. There are rotating taps for you beer snobs (like me).  There is a patio off to the side and a good-sized dining room. It does get crowded hence our late lunch HH visits.  Pro tip during football season Friday nights are packed pre-game."

Service was good and the place was small but cozy and clean.   We ordered the fish n chips and a burger with onion rings. The burger was fine, very average and a little bland. The fries that came with the fish were also ok but a little cold. The onion rings and the fish is the part I wanted to love but didn't. Taste wise they were good. However, they had so much batter on them it made me feel sick after just a few bites. I know these were heavy items to order for lunch, but the ratio of batter was just too much."

                "description": "Perhaps one of the best local pizza places in Round Rock.  Their menu is definitely creative, they have a lot of amazing pizza combinations or you can always create your own.  You can also order a whole pizza or order by the slice which my wife loved since she usually doesn't eat too much.   We ordered the Orig Mama Gallo and it came with sliced meatballs and pepperoni. The combination of meats were great. The crust and dough were amazing and so soft. Their beer selection is quite extensive, I found a local beer from a small brewery I had never heard of before. I loved it so much that I ended up visiting the local brewery in Pflugerville.  Definitely give it a shot if you are a pizza lover like I am."

                "description": "Bought some wings this weekend.  Tried out the:  Kentucky Bourbon - Amazing! Right level of heat, smoke, and sweetness  Teriyaki- Sweet and tasted exactly how teriyaki sauce should taste. Deep notes of ginger which was amazing  Lemon pepper- could have been a lot better. It was almost as if they just sprinkled a little bit of essence of the seasoning.  Honestly couldn't tell the difference between the lemon pepper and the following wings.  Taco- I could see the seasoning but they were basically naked wings. The only flavor I could sort of taste was cumin, which was kinda blah. I wouldn't call these Taco Flavor. A good idea to market these as taco flavor would be to market the as \"carnita wings\" fry them up until they are super crunchy like chicharrón crunchy then serve them with side of salsa. If you use this please credit me! Lol free wings with a year would be nice too lol ;)"

                "description": "I honestly do not know where to begin with this review......I get it, possibly short staffed, since I did see a sign out front, but management should adjust how many patrons are seated if that's the case. 1. We signed up for space available seating for six people, mind you, two were planning to order single slices. We get to the restaurant and the first thing that strikes four of us as odd is the fact that the \"greeter\" had the emotions of Wednesday Addams...zero expressions nor cordiality. Did not see a smile one from this person. She should reconsider her position, but I'd suggest she work BOH the way she appeared.  2. Our waiter/order taker person, whatever the pronoun is today was flat out.....Terrible! His name was AJ, AJ was not attentive, didn't write ANYTHING down, did not take our drink orders(he was reminded by the bar staff). After he \"mental\" took our order down l noticed the \"I got you look\", AJ did not have us. Nope, ordered sweet tea, got unsweetened, came back with an excuse, we brushed it off. Ten minutes later, came back and asked my wife and I what pizza we ordered(again, he wrote it down mentally), I asked him to guess...when I told him a number 12 he replied, \"I knew it, was just checking.\" I honestly could keep going on number two, as the service was just that....shit.  3. Nothing, I mean nothing arrived on time. My Brother received his pizza before ANY of the the reheat and serve slices came out. My wife and I got ours after he'd finished half of the pizza. After the complete shit show for service, as soon as our pizza came out we got a to-go box. I could expound on every one of these points, but I won't.   All in all the bill was $145, only one beer was ordered. I was \"fine\" with leaving a $20 tip for the service we received, but was talked into being generous. My old self would not have been so nice. Maybe folks are used to this service at this establishment, but for the money we paid I would have been happier with a PJ pizza and some good garlic butter sauce! Oh, I attached a pic of my pizza from last night...."

One time we ordered it for delivery and were charged mega bucks by the delivery service, so we'll never do that again.  Another time I placed an order over the phone to go and had to wait outside for about 15-20 minutes past the pickup time because there were so many people in line."

                "description": "Slap Box is an interesting name for a Pizzaria with an included drafthouse. I stumbled upon this spot after Google searching \"pizza near me\". I was sawyer by the 4 star Yelp reviews, I had detour from my original plan to visit Pinthouse Pizza.   There's plenty of parking in fact there's an indoor covered parking lot on the same block around the corner. Upon entry the ambiance is well wonderful. There's enough tables and an ample amount of TV's to watch any of your heart's desire for sports.  I proceeded directly to the bar to order my pizza and beer to go.  When I sat down at the bar I ordered a pepperoni pizza and some water. After the pizza arrived after about 15 minutes or so I decided to sample a couple of ciders. I tried the Meridian Hive Cherry and the Meridian Hive Rhapsody. I ended up buying the Meridian Hive Cherry. It was on the sweeter side think like a wine.  When I finally tried the pizza it was pretty good. It was above average and I would try it again. The wings were really good. The sauce was flavorful and robust. The chicken was very good too. I definitely recommend Slap Box!"

                "description": "Located in downtown Round Rock, this pizza place is right next to the Main Street plaza.  During CoVid times, we ordered to-go and ate in the plaza next door since it was a lovely afternoon.   Be forewarned, if you get a slice... it is a BIG slice!  See the La Jolla slice picture. It's huge!  The kids loved their pizza. Not a surprise there since it was your typical pepperoni.   I had a GF, vegan pizza for the first time and it was pretty good. I'm so glad they had this option on the menu so I didn't have to order a salad.   They had lots of beer options on tap but we didn't partake this time. Next time, we will. Give them a try!"

                "description": "1. Let me just start off by saying, I grew up in a small town in Chicago Illinois so you could say pizza is my thing, and quite frankly slapbox pizzacheria or whatever the pronoun for this place is today has just that(pizza) 2. My experience at the slap was quite literally the reason I am willing to go back. Although it is clear to me that they are fairly understaffed the staff that work there currently are quite a joy. When you walk in you are greeted by a very interesting fellow that has the likes of Wednesday Adams from the Adams family, aswell as the door swinging wide open. Luckily for me I really enjoyed Wednesday Adams in the movie as she was my favorite character. Also I think people should be less hard on her at the slap because she seems to be doing good at her job as a greeter. 3. Our order taker person or whatever was also a very pleasant person. When we were seated by the greeter our order taker person named I believe adam was extremely nice and energetic,it was a damn shame my friends and I did not grab his number because he was looking extra fine the day we came in. Other than that he was still very nice and made sure our food was out on time. 4. To wrap up my essay on the slap I think it would be nice for me to talk about our experience with the food. Putting my Chicago ego aside my friends and I decided to order pizza here. I ordered the El Camino and let me tell you it might have been a fan favorite of mine, heck I could go for a slice right now while writing this review. 5. In conclusion I think slapbox pizzacheria is a great place to hangout and eat some pizza with friends and family. I also think that other reviewers shouldn't set a 4 star restaurant at such a high standard the place is ran aswell as it can be with the amount of staff they are given. My friends and I will most definitely be coming back to the slap as we enjoyed our stay"

HUGE slices! Lots of variety and interesting toppings. AND this is a pizza restaurant but do not overlook the wings. They are sooo good. I love the dry rub ranch and recently tried the bourbon glaze which was super tasty. They have a great variety of beers on tap and attentive service. Also, a great place for take away. Slapbox is a fantastic addition to downtown Round Rock."

I had a pretty eventful day but I knew that I wanted to still go catch a movie. I came to a pretty late showing and yet the service was great. Of course you always expect that the end of someone's shift that they would be low on energy but the service was fast friendly. The movie theater was clean the bathrooms are clean and there was plenty of parking."

                "description": "My husband and I were looking forward to our first movie date in two years due to the pandemic. We went to see Ghostbusters Afterlife the Friday night after the premiere. Everything started out fine: we placed our drink and appetizer order before the show started. Got our mozzarella sticks and they were slightly underdone. Eh whatever, not a huge deal. Our beer and Bavarian Pretzel pizza were good, no complaints. However, the service not so much. On top of the fact our waitress took forever, she accused us of smoking in the theatre. I told her there was a vape cloud that came up on the row in front of us and I never saw anyone go talk to them. So maybe make sure you're accusing the right person next time. THEN our popcorn was burnt and we still got charged for it after letting them know. We'll keep going to Moviehouse in the future."

                "description": "My husband and I rented a theater for a special occasion during covid. It wasn't exactly cheap ($150 for the rental, plus tickets and food/drink separately) but we missed movie theaters so much that we sprung for it. It was definitely worth it. The Alamo crew took so many precautions before and during our stay that although I was very anxious about the rental at first, I was able to relax and enjoy the show. Like others have said, all movie theaters are surely suffering right now and we need to support Alamo so that they're here when the pandemic is over. I love this theater chain so much, it'd be devastating for me personally if they were to close."

But now that we have our vax, we decided to risk a super special outing -- we did a Your Own Private Alamo rental to celebrate a milestone birthday in the family. Just our inner circle, all by ourselves ... with a movie! And popcorn! And freakin' amazing buffalo cauliflower! In public, having our first normal-ish outing in over a year! Seriously, it was fun, and the Alamo took good care of us."

                "description": "I'm torn between nostalgia and the elevated level of service (and price) other theatres are offering.  This is classic Alamo.  It's like rediscovering your first car.  Fixed bar-style eating surface in front of the fixed seats, no leg rests or fully reclining seats.  The service was GREAT, albeit we were intentionally at a TERRIBLE horror movie (The Turning) that had maybe 10 people in the cinema with us.  Still, an employee could slack in that situation and they did not.    The screen and sound were good.    There was no lounge in the theater that I saw to relax and have drinks before or after the movie.    And, after many visits to other theatres, it was unusual not to have a button to press for service.  Rather, you physically put your order card up on the table for a server to see when they come by.  I was really concerned about this because I knew how bad the movie was going to be early on and drinks were part of the plan!! lol  But in retrospect, maybe having to physically check on the patrons is what made the service so attentive (I got the drinks I needed to get through the picture -- thank you, Jesus).  So, obviously I'm torn.  It is a retro experience for me having experienced my first dine-in theater at an Alamo. I would go back here again in a heartbeat.  But it is like getting in a classic car and then realizing you actually like modern bucket seats and power steering.  At the same time that classic car was less expensive and still brings a smile to your face.  I'm going to rank based on the model Alamo built and on fulfilling my memories of great service...and I'm looking forward to going back again! :)"

Secondly, they have the nicest staff, and their food is always delicious! If there's any issue, they handle it quickly and efficiently. They're also super clean, and have been really amazing with COVID protocols. I feel comfortable going back to the movies because of Alamo Drafthouse. Thanks for always going above and beyond!"

                "description": "This is a review for the family party movies that Alamo does.   We went to a Family Party on Sunday. This is our second time for a family party and they rock! 45 minutes before the movie they have crafts for the kids (seems like usually 3-4 stations) and then they have an interactive dance or activity at the front of the theater immediately before the movie. It makes the movie an event for the kids.   Now if I could somehow watch a movie I want to see while the kids watched their cartoon!"

                "description": "My wife and I attended the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring 3:00 p.m. showing at Lakeline Alamo on Saturday, March 27. It was our first public outing since last year before Covid-19 struck. We were excited and nervous to venture out, but trusted Alamo's protocols.  We walk into the theater and there is just one guy there, sitting a couple rows from the projector, American flag bandana for a mask sitting around his neck not covering his face, scrolling on his phone. He makes a couple calls and talks loudly, checking on his insurance apparently. He continues to do it halfway through the movie previews. My wife and I are already annoyed. Not a good start.  The movie begins and the guy behind us has been quiet for 10 minutes. Things seem to be turning for the better. That is, until a short while into the movie when he starts making comments aloud. \"No!\" to Gandalf leaving Frodo. \"Asshole!\" to Saruman betraying Gandalf. I grit my teeth and exchange glances with my wife as it continues, both of us hoping it subsides.  Nope. The loud asshole decides to keep making his commentary like it's his own personal screening. I finally have had enough of it about an hour into the film and place an order card that read \"Please tell the guy behind us to stop talking! He keeps doing it!\" The server comes five minutes later, takes it and nods. She does nothing.  Another 30 minutes goes by. This guy's behavior continues. He even plays a video on his phone for all to hear at one point. He's all I can focus on now, my enjoyment of the movie totally ruined. I storm out of the theater determined to get someone to kick him out.  I find a young guy with a pony tail who is clearly a server. I plea my case that this guy needs to go. He seems to take my request seriously and I return, hoping the Alamo's well-known policy of kicking out disruptors will finally be used on this guy ruining our movie.  Well, that wasn't the case. 10, then 20 minutes go by. I didn't see anyone come into the theater to handle it. The pest behind us makes comments aloud less frequently, probably because my wife yelled at him to shut up at one point. While I couldn't blame her for taking it into her own hands, I wanted the Alamo staff to do something about it like I know they should.  In retrospect, maybe it wasn't a bad idea because nothing was done to kick him out as I requested. The movie nears its end and the guy shouts again. Finally, we hear someone behind us address him, apparently letting him off with a warning. After all he had done throughout the course of the film to ruin the movie for us, it was far too little, far too late.  Amazingly, it actually worked that someone talked to him. He shut up for the 10 minutes left in the movie and didn't say anything during the cast reunion piece that followed the credits. So had the staff addressed this nuisance earlier like I wanted, perhaps this outing would have been salvagable. Mind you, I first brought it to the attention of the staff an hour into a THREE HOUR MOVIE. They finally say something to him with only 10-15 minutes left. Completely unacceptable, if you ask me.  Our server tells us shortly after one of her staff finally talked to the guy that she told a manager and that she was sorry the loud patron was like this. He seems \"a little 'special,' you know what I mean?\" is what she says. Whether that's true or not is frankly irrelevant. You have a policy in place that you remind patrons every single time they visit your theaters. No talking, no texting. Problem with a loud table? Raise an order card and a staff member will address it, eventually asking them to leave without a refund. Had this policy been followed as outlined, he should have been given a warning an hour into the movie and then instructed to leave without a refund 30 minutes later when I pleaded to the staff to take care of it. Case closed. The way it was handled in reality was an absolute joke and insult.  We were happy to attend this screening as our first outing. Now, after this incident, we will no longer give Alamo our business."

Even for a  vegetarian.  The best part of the experience for me is that people are told to turn off phones and be quiet. No one else is doing this and it is a thoughtful reminder.  Although some people don't quite get it and continue to talk, there was enough attention to keep the majority of chatter box's quite:-)"

Love to get there a half hour early and watch the pre-show entertainment. It's unique, nostalgic, and always funny. None of the advertisement bombardment you get at other theaters.   The food is always excellent   The 2x2 burger is my favorite and I've never been disappointed. It's a 5 star version of the Big Mac. The Colorado steak salad is also a regular favorite.   Drinks are always cold and the buttered popcorn with real butter is ridiculously delicious.   Awesome selection of adult beverages.   Love this place."

We were served pretty quickly. We loved the Pizza which was the Meat Pizza. It was hot and fresh. My wife was not a fan of the Chardonnay. My son thought his Pepperoni pizza was great and liked the Milkshake as well. We enjoyed the reserve seating. Just before the movie started we ordered some popcorn and a beer to split.   What cost them a star in my opinion was the Popcorn. It was really cold and without Salt or much Butter and taste like it was made at home. The main thing I like about the Movies is the Popcorn is always unbelievable. This was the opposite and was memorable for the worst reason. The other annoyance was the lack of under the table lighting when the bill arrived during the movie. I tried and quickly gave up so my wife finally figured out what we owed and paid in the dark. Not sure I have a fix just saying this is not good for older people with less then perfect night vision.  Definitely more to like than dislike here. We will be back."

While they have a tempting kids menu, the booster seats make for an uncomfortable experience for the littles too.

(The girl at the front door (hostess) is crabby but no biggy.) the bartender is very good with staying on top of her customers needs. I do think there should be an employee bathroom because the gals have to hang out there and are in and out to maintenance their appearance, And as a customer it's not professional to go into a bathroom full of employees, whom are talking about customers, their hair and make up, their boyfriends etc. it makes me think that twin peaks doesn't value their employees enough to even provide them with a break/powder room."

I walked in after 10min only to find out they are out of all chicken wings and they are going to refund my order. Funny story is I only placed the order for 12pc of chicken wings and she failed to inform me right when I called to check in on my order. It would have been nice to give a customer call if you're out of something rather than giving false information and making me come all the way there."

They have a lot of specials during the weekdays, not too much during the weekend when we went though.  Clientele is varied...ranging from dudes by themselves to buddies watching the game to confederate flag t-shirt/jacket wearing fellas.   All in all, not as trashy as I was expecting and it was an interesting experience. The food was actually pretty decent so I may take out in the future but I don't think I'll be back to eat-in anytime soon."

This location provides consistently high quality from the food to the service, and now the environment has been upgraded!  I really enjoy the new look.  The restaurant is more open and some of the tables are cafeteria style which promotes a social atmosphere.  There are still individual tables though.  Hell I usually sit alone.  I just like seeing people having a good time.   There are some stunning as well as super nice servers here but it has pretty much always been that way since I've been coming here.    They offer a variety of food on the menu including healthy choices and a veggie burger that is just fantastic.  Best of all it won't break the bank...unless you go stupid on the tip.  P10 is down the street haha.  But the servers do seem to build rapport with repeat customers.  Overall if you haven't been here in awhile, it's worth another visit.  I suggest Friday during happy hour.  You're welcome!"

We arrived early to get good seating. We were informed upon arrival (PRIOR TO BEING SEATED) if we stayed past 8PM that we would be charged $5 for the fights. This is nice because we've been places where they try to up charge customers unexpectedly long after the fights have been on.   From the Hostess to our server (Jax) we were given excellent customer service. Watching the fights there was good and the food was even better! You can't go wrong with those burgers!!!   We had our child with us, and it was still a good experience, all the girls were soo sweet and kind to her and she loves the attention! We love coming here with our daughter because they always treat us kindly!  Still recommend!"

Cocktails are amazing and they're always coming up with some new tasty concoctions!  During the holidays they had eggnog to go, and it was hands down the best eggnog I have ever had!   Everything I have eaten here is a 10 out of 10! We have tried almost everything on the menu and I've enjoyed every dish!  Our favorite appetizer is the brussel sprouts and if you want to splurge get the steak dinner.....WOW!  It could be the best steak I have ever had!  The servers go above and beyond and are always cheerful and accommodating.  The ambiance is super cool and hip from the lounge chairs, to the wall accents, they did a great job designing it! The owners of this restaurant really put in the time and dedication to come up with such a great concept and a great addition to the downtown square. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"

We ordered a few shareables for the table, including the Cantonese Riblets, Salt and Pepper Calamari and Carne Asada Fries. All three were delicious, but my favorite was hands down the riblets. They slid right off the bone and tasted a lot more authentic than I was initially expecting. The fries were the next runner up because you can never go wrong with fries covered in queso. For lunch, I ordered the Italian Sausage Burger. I really enjoyed it and it came with more waffle fries! I thought I'd love the sausage patty, however, I think I would have enjoyed a different protein to fill it out a little more. It was worth a try though!  The service was great here and everyone was super friendly. Parking can get a little tricky, but there's plenty of spots if you're not going at peak hours. I'm excited to stop by for dinner, when they have a lot more choices! I don't mind shareables, but I felt like the lunch menu was a little limited and nothing really stuck out to me."

We were excited to get out of the house and try this place!  My husband ordered the fried chicken and it was fine.  I ordered the steak frite and it was somewhere between luke-warm and cold.  Waffle fries are NOT good cold!  I told the waiter and he said he would \"warm it up.\"  ...But he left it at the table!  Then he proceeded to go help like 6 other tables and finally got back to me 15 min later (by now my husband was done with his chicken), and take my steak frite.  It was so confusing.  He said \"sorry, I had to go check on other tables - I'll go heat it up now.\"  He came back with it literally 2 min later and it was EXACTLY the same - I swear, he didn't actually do anything.  I said \"ummm...it's still cold.\" And he said \"okay, I'll ask the manager if we can comp it.\"  WHAT?!?  Then he came back with a check and we paid and left.  I literally never ate!!!  I was so hungry!  I kept expecting him to bring something hot and it just never came!  He completely blew me off and didn't even try to make it right.  I don't care about something being comped or getting a free dessert or whatever, I just want to have dinner with my husband and actually eat (ha!)  when we arrange a babysitter and make it out!!!  We both commented we would have been better off at home cooking ourselves.  It was so bizarre!    Don't bother with this place!  The decor is super contrived - definitely trying to be something it's not.  The wine list is also very short and unimpressive - just a side note if you're looking for a nice glass.  So bummed."

I personally prefer the good old fashion but there is a drink there for everybody's taste and if you're into spicy alcoholic drinks they do some of those just right as well!  While drinking we tried out some of their deviled eggs and I was happily impressed each one of them is for a flavor and unique although the Sriracha was my favorite!  I've had dinner here before and I can say it's worth it but for our trip we just had a couple drinks and sat on the patio which if that's all you're looking to do is completely OK this is a great place to go!!"

                "description": "Wow, I want to give this place 5 stars, and I hope they trend up but the food is a 3 star experience - at best.  Ambiance is perfect! Less than a block off the square in downtown Georgetown with plenty of free street parking [when Georgetown starts going to valets, I'm moving.] Lots of people walking around: this is a walking little town.  The place itself has a very expansive outside deck with even a few more street side tables - with the fans and heaters I'm betting you get 9-10 months of outside seating here.  Inside the bar is not large but it is gorgeous and there are some table tops as well as lounge seating - comfy old chairs, some Victorian love seats - its really charming and inviting. You will love the ambiance.  Service was fast, friendly and professional - I dealt with three different mixologists and not a surly one in the bunch [try finding that percentage of happy people in Austin...] and the make a wonderful drink. PS: wines on tap (they're not bad) and you have GOT to try a smoked Old Fashion (try the alder wood - its delicious smokiness in a perfect drink.]  PS: At least two rooms for private parties too if you need that holiday gathering!  Why no five stars then? Sounds great! It is great if you go for friends, drinks and good times. But unless we picked the worst entries - chicken and a burger - the food is underwhelming. My neighbor to one side also said her deviled eggs were just average. To be fair, the food was not bad, but it was not good and does not compare with other places around the square.  So; for drinks and maybe an appetizer and ambiance this has got to be on your short list. Think twice about this as a dining destination though - that may not be your best option."

                "description": "I'll start with what The Golden Rule (TGR) got right.  The service was awesome.  Our server was very efficient and personable with great attention to detail.    The food arrived quickly and was good.    The seasoning on the waffle fries was something new.  It reminded me of Old Bay, but with a hint of brown sugar?  It actually worked well.  What needs to improve - I'm glad the window looking out onto the street is gilded with the phrase \"Always a Work in Progress..\" (or words to this effect) since I have some suggestions/observations.  There are three areas to improve - Seating, Selection, and Atmosphere.  First, Seating - why am I sitting on a couch using a coffee table to eat?  I'm dropping nearly two bills on a meal for three people and I'm sitting on a couch using a coffee table?  Maybe if I was just there for a drink, it would be ok.  But not to actually eat a meal.  (I'm sorry about the queso which dripped on the floor. But again - it is tough to eat queso at a coffee table.)  Also, sitting by the huge glass window feels like being in a fish bowl.. People walking down the sidewalk can stop and watch you eat.  Actually, they DO stop and watch.  It happened at least twice while we were there.   It reminded me of an old \"Twilight Zone\" episode. In the episode, an astronaut crashes on Mars and ends up on display in a Martian zoo.  (After he crashes, the astronaut is scared at first, but the Martians are very kind to him and give him a house to stay in.  The Martians show the astronaut the house has all the conveniences and plenty of food.  When the Martians leave, the astronaut discovers the front door is locked and the window won't open.  Later, the astronaut wakes up to find the window open, with dozens of Martians staring inside the house.  The astronaut realizes he is actually the newest exhibit in a Martian zoo, not in a real house.)  There was a sign out front, \"Earthling in his native habitat\"  That's what this seating felt like.   Next, Selection - the beer selection is very slim.  The beer portion on the menu was (verbatim) as follows:     \"Beers on Tap         Hazy IPA        Amber        Hefe        Lager  Ask your server for featured breweries...\"  I asked the server about the vague beer list:  SERVER:  \"And for you, sir?\" ME:          \"Yes, ma'am - Do y'all have Shiner?\" SERVER:  \"No, sir, we just have local beers.\" ME:          \"Awesome.  What do you have from Barking Armadillo?\"   SERVER:  \"Nothing.  What kind of beer are you looking for?\" ME:          \"Something like a Shiner?\" SERVER:   \"We have Brooklyn Lager.\" ME:          \"I'll just stick with water, ma'am...\"  Brooklyn? Local? Similar to Shiner?  You say you have \"local\" beers but yet you have nothing from the local brewery just on the other side of I-35?  As far as Brooklyn - Every so often, I find a restaurant (usually around Dallas) which lists Shiner on the \"Imported Beer\" portion.  I guess geography - specifically Texas geography - is not their strong point.  TGR has the opposite perspective, since apparently Brooklyn is now local to Georgetown.  Finally - Atmosphere.  It is very loud.  It wants to be trendy.  I'm not sure how to fix that.   Maybe this is why I had to sit on a couch."

                "description": "Love this place! It's got a speakeasy feel right off the square in Georgetown! They have exclusive membership options that provide you with a locker for your special stash, so you always have your favorite spirit on hand. I know this because my little bro is a member. He's got a cool locker with some great whiskey in there, and they have a great selection as well.   There is limited seating inside so all of the seating feels exclusive! It's also just a fantastic feel inside and out. The patio is big and adorable, complete with a picture wall the screams social media opp! If I lived in Georgetown, this is where I would hang out. I will definitely make it my spot when I make it over to Gtown!   All of the food we had was interesting and tasty! The pimento app was not your grandma's pimento. It was creamy and not abrasive at all. The Brussels sprouts were so good I could have eaten a couple helpings myself! The sauce is the same for the shrimp, so I was in sweet and spicy heaven! I want more right now just writing this review. The fam enjoyed the chorizo app.   I had moved on to the smoked old fashioned by then and was completely captivated! I added a video that you should check out or just go and order one. The smoke adds to the experience AND taste! Yum. They have a small, but very good, draft selection, creative cocktail menu, and the option to drink your own spirits if you're a member. I can't say enough that I love this place!  Hunter did an amazing job as our server. He was friendly, attentive, and showed his fantastic personality."

                "description": "I went here for the first time last week. The host asked me if I had a reservation, I did not, but they were still able to quickly get me a table. The atmosphere is very elegant, yet chill. The low light in the building added to the overall relaxed vibe. I ordered from the morning menu; there weren't as much options as I would have liked for there to be, so I just settled for the Calamari and Waffle Fries. The food came out much faster than I expected, so I am not surprised that it was a little cold. The food was delicious though... especially the sauce that came with the Calamari! The Ranch was very good and paired well with the food! The sweet tea was average, yet still good. The price is a little much for the quality/amount of the food. I plan on going back in the evening and ordering off of the evening menu."

                "description": "I was impressed with the entire evening. It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant where I loved everything I tried and had great service! It seemed like most people visiting sat out on the patio or at the bar. We were celebrating our anniversary so we made a reservation on a weeknight, but unless you want to secure a spot outside, I don't think you'd need one.   We ordered the glazed brussel sprouts app, the carne asada fries app, and the sea bass to split. Each dish was delicious for different reasons. The glaze on the brussels was addicting, the queso on the fries was delish, and the sea bass came out piping hot with a tasty chimichurri and sautéed vegetables. I would recommend every dish we tried, but my favorite was by far the brussels. We topped dinner off with the blonde brownie w/ ice cream - yyyuuummmm.   For cocktails: Our waiter suggested the Love is Blind with a spash of pineapple - tricky little drink. It tasted like candy but found out halfway in that there was definitely a good amount of liquor in it! The G'old fashioned was classic and strong.   Service was top notch. I wish I remembered his name, but he was super friendly and had great recommendations."

Well I like it for it's modern atmosphere. We got drunken fried and all the cocktails seems good mixes just a bit more alcohol would be nice. One star knocked off because of that and the waitresses seems slightly uppity. No one extra welcoming and excited to converse with us aside from the smiling hostess.   Will still come back since I like the environment."

Only downside was that we were looking forward to the cocktail flight but they don't allow on Saturday night (it's a major item on the menu - should be noted if it's only during the day).   For food, everything we had was really good. The Brussels sprouts and the fries (yes fries - you could actually taste the potato) were standouts. Lost of sauces to pair with things too. The only downer was the queso - good taste but the tostadas were a bit stale and the queso itself was a bit congealed by the time it reached the table.   Will be happy to come back - a great option for something a bit more upscale in Georgetown."

From the decor to the atmosphere to the menu and creative bar offerings - this spot definitely takes it to the next level as far as dining in Georgetown goes. Everything on the appetizer menu was delicious - loved the deviled eggs and the steak against the grain. I really wish they offered the craft cocktail flight during dinner service as it looked really fun to try. I would absolutely recommend making a reservation to make sure you get a table. The only downside was the service could have been a little better. Several items that we ordered were forgotten and our waitress was not very friendly. However, overall I really enjoyed coming here and would love to come back to try brunch. Definitely a great option if you're looking to eat somewhere on the square."

The drinks are largely bourbon based, which I love, but they have standard bar fare and beer as well.   The food is delicious and I think it's a testament to say that even the fried bologna sandwich is a winner!  The patio is lovely for this time of year and fairly generous in size. I really hope they can survive the upheaval of the dining industry during these crazy times."

It took around 30 minutes to get seated which was understandable since they were pretty understaffed. I got the house salad with blue cheese dressing and tomato bisque soup as my sides. Both were pretty tasty although nothing super special. Portion sizes were really great though and could've been enough for dinner for me without the steak. I would definitely recommend coming for the Thursday special if you're looking for a good deal!   My family only ate one of the pizookies and got the other three to go. Our server Elias was very thoughtful and packed the ice cream and the mousse in separate containers from the pizookies to prevent them from getting soggy. I appreciated Elias providing great service despite the restaurant being understaffed."

The entrees were all barely warm and cool to the touch. Within a few minutes we were eating cold food. The $17 Alfredo bowl was dry and cold. The garlic knot was cold. The hamburger was tasteless despite having fried jalapeños and chipotle Mayo. The meat needed seasoning. The fries, although tasty, were cold. The tea had a strange bitterness to it. They probably need to clean out their machine. The only thing palatable were the avocado egg rolls as I love the tamarind sauce. They were piping hot. We got 2 orders for a total of 12 costing $26. We should've stopped there. In the end the manager did comp the Alfredo but for high prices and below par food and service I'd say go elsewhere. BTW we loved BJ's when we lived in McAllen (this location was epic!) so this experience was very disappointing."

Ordered the \"slow roasted\" tri-tip and it was the toughest cut of meat I've ever encountered so this piece must have been \"rush roasted\". The overall flavor of the meat would have been pretty decent if the meat were actually edible. Also ordered the fettuccine alfredo, comes with chicken and broccoli. Not bad but oddly tastes exactly like a Marie Callendar's TV dinner so at this point I'm convinced they purchased a family size dinner, warmed it, placed in their own packaging then sprinkled some Parmesan on top. Normally, I'd just take the loss but in this case I want my money back, this is just unacceptable."

                "description": "I've always enjoyed BJ's until this past Christmas Eve. My mom and I decided to use BJs curbside for our Christmas Eve dinner, just some burgers and fries. Well, when we brought home our order we were without fries. Bad on us for not checking the order when it was delivered to our vehicle before we drove home. I called BJs to explain what happened. I fully realize that they were busy due to the Holiday. I understand the pressures restaurants face during these times. But, I was told to come back to get the fries, which by then our burgers would be cold. The gentleman on the phone, who I'm sure was just having a bad day because he wasn't to friendly or apologetic, then offered a refund. He took down my information but I've yet to be refunded. I basically spent $33 on two hamburgers from BJs. Very disappointing as this was our Christmas Eve dinner and I'm on such a tight budget as it is. Needless to say, I won't be dining or doing curbside with BJs any longer."

The place is half full and they don't have the help to serve a whole restaurant. Some of y'all need to get off your lazy duffs and go back to work! Your year of socialism is NOT sustainable.. BJs is also still enforcing social distancing through table restrictions. In their bar the two end tables were restricted but all the ones in-between were occupied (go figure)."

But more importantly, Layne made me feel like I was Batman and he was Alfred... how did I come to this kind of service? It's one thing to have a million dollars but Layne made me feel like a million bucks. Layne... I hope you get a raise, hell, I hope you run a BJ's yourself. You know how to make people feel like they are the only ones in the restaurant where they feel like they are getting the best service. Again thank you for a wonderful experience my dear Alfred. Cheers to you and all your endeavors."

                "description": "i come to bjs every tuesday for $3 pizookies. This week i decided to branch out and go to the round rock location opposed to the cedar park location...that was my first mistake. There was a long wait, no problem i understand and didn't mind. As soon as me and my acquaintance sat down, our waitress haley was there to serve us. My friend asked for a children's menu which the cedar park location always allows. Haley said no until we begged and told her the other location gives it to us no problem. She hesitantly gave in. i felt as though she did not respect my friend and i at all because of our age. Later at the time of payment my friend asked if they offer a military discount, normal question right? My friends father was in the navy, serving our country, fighting for our freedom, for 22 years. My friend has a valid military ID with her picture on it that she was ready to present. Instead our server haley, when presented with the question of weather or not they offer a military discount said in a very belittling tone \"your not in the military\" instead of saying that they don't offer the discount for family members. When i go out to eat anywhere i always leave a very large tip, well over 20% because i work in a restaurant and i know the servers depend on these tips for their livelihood. I feel as though haley was rude and didn't deserve a tip that was anymore than 20% though. The way she spoke to us was belittling and there was so much better ways she could have said these things to us."

We went on Saturday and the waiter took our order (family of four).  The kids food came out first and my husband's and mine came out about five min later.   My husband's stake was rare.  The waiter had walked away right after dropping off food.  He didn't come back for several minutes.  When he did he took the stake.  He didn't come back w it for about ten min.  Our family had finished eating before the stake ever came back.   When it came back it was over done  They didn't take it off the bill.  No apologies.  We understand staffing may be an issue with all that is going on.  Until staffing is fixed?  I would avoid here.   This used to be one of my favorite places"

I walk in and there's a table with some merchandise on it and this little man, asked if we were there for the event? I said \"we didn't know there was an event\" and then he said it was $25 per person... well we didn't know, we just came for a drink and some parents night out. So I said sorry and we excused ourselves and then this same lady at the front was smoking outside so I said \"Sorry, we didn't know it was an event\" and she snarkily says \"Yeah! it's dwarf wrestling!\" Like I should be ashamed of not knowing this. I feel stupid, my bad.... But maybe next time have a sign on the door! We read the entire door and no sign about this, a cover of $10-15 we would pay but we didn't want to do $25 per person, since we had not  arrived for the event. I think if you have an event, try being a bit nicer. Some people are not regulars and just want to come over and you could sell it a bit, instead of making us feel bad for not know about your poorly advertised event.  I still like this bar and I like that people can smoke in doors (although I'm not a smoker) we have enough bars we can go too and this one is for smokers, so I don't have an issue and I know what I'll smell like when I leave."

If that's not a problem for you, then you're in for a good time.   We came in on a Tuesday night and easily found a pool table to ourselves. We opened a tab and had no trouble getting drinks without having to leave our games. The mixed drinks are nothing to write home about, but we had an excellent time drinking and playing pool. We also easily played some table shuffle board. They have computer slots/keno games to gamble with in a shady corner is that's something you're into.   The place was acceptably clean and the staff were all very friendly. Just make sure you have a VALID drivers license regardless of your age! This was place was a good time and I'll definitely be back again in the future."

When I got home everything smelled like cigarettes. This is completely illegal and just downright nasty. Everybody knows secondhand cigarette smoke is really bad for you so open up a flipping window if you're gonna let people smoke. If you're too lazy to go outdoors to smoke then this place should be regulated by the health department better, this isn't your house, and no one saying you can't do something but it's just nasty and it's really bad for your health right now my throat is on fire because I've been breathing secondhand smoke I don't wanna sound like a whiner or entitled millennial but it secondhand smoke dude and it's nasty."

Staff has always been good to me over the years, and have been like family, met many current friends because of Shooters. Never a cover, and probably the best drink prices of any bar.  This place has great potential, but they need to make the best of some of its best assets, especially the use that beautiful patio more for events, music, etc. You should have a solo acoustic artist out there in spring/summer/fall and promote some games on the patio, it just seems as it's used as wasted space currently, and that's a shame."

Bartender was patient with us as we pondered our last cocktail of the day. Notice I said day not evening. We settled on shots (why not??!!). We all received generous pours at a reasonable price.   Shooters is a great sports bar with multiple TVS (they do have the NFL ticket). There are plenty of pool tables and games to keep you occupied. I would definitely come here to watch games but the cigarette smoke stench is too much for me, and I'm a cigar smoker. We visited for about 10 minutes and my clothes stunk of smoke. I wish they would go smokeless like their other venue on 620 or at least add some additional smoke eaters. If you are a smoker it is a 5 star joint... for others 3 makes it AOK and a fair rating."

So you go pay to get horrible service from him.   2. If you go gamble be prepared to share the machines with the workers as they are on their shift and serving you drinks as they have their machine on auto play and by that I've only seen one person dong this by the name of Desiree or Mrs Des for short.  Last time I saw her was a few weeks ago when I went after work to enjoy myself for a few drinks and even tho I go alone I do have friends there and she was so occupied playing and asking around if her machine was paying her a lady was complaining about how she hadn't give her her change back. It took her a long time to pay that lady back. It's not the first time I've seen her playing specially when it's slow but busy days won't stop her. Chris and her make a fabulous team as far as proving the worst service!!   3. Misty and the rest of the girls are the best workers there.   Too bad they lost me as a customer and will never spend one cent on that place ever again. Seeing employees playing as they work while others risk their hard worked money was the end of that. I already had enough with Chris being rude when you bother him because it seems that way. Good luck Shooters! This place has gone down hill since the past 6 months or so!!"

I do prefer more sauce but, still good.   The pepperoni had the crunchy edges I like   Took home a piece of red velvet and Italian cream for my last    We both loved it all   Only one register so slow going but I recommend you try this out if the was gas station pub.   Serve alcohol on site and sell NUMEROUS types of beers microbrew stuff-more than I've seen most places."

When I got there, I waited an extra 15 minutes for the pizza. So 45 minutes after I ordered.  Normally that's not that bad but there was literally 5 people in the whole restaurant. 2 of them were working. That's pretty slow.    Brought it home and honestly I've had better frozen pizza.  It was real doughy and lacked a lot of flavor. Minimal sausage and the mushrooms. I bit off a piece and the cheese completely came off the pizza and there was barely any sauce holding the cheese on.  It was heavy on the dough and nothing else.   Unless they change the recipes and use more fresh ingredients, I won't be back."

Brought in a group of four, and bar tender insulted me and my beer choice after I sampled a hazy ale, asked if he had a pale ale, and settled on a Yuengling.   He then ignored my wife when she tried to place order. The place was dead slow on a Monday night. I used to come more often, probably won't be back. There are plenty of places to grab a beer."

High Country is a gas station..... with a bar in it, food, oh and casually 100s of different kinds of craft beer. Need I say more?   We stopped in on a Sunday to check out the selection and ended up staying for a beer and a burger.   The food: amazing and fresh. We did the $5 Sunday burger special, and might I mention the KETCHUP. I believe it's truffle ketchup, has me drooling about when I get to try it again.   The bar: great selection of beers on tap, they also have a whole selection of wine. In addition to the tap they have a variety of bottles in the fridge you can also pick from. They do Monday ALL DAY pint happy hour for $3.50, which is as cheap as they come by and local brewery tap takeovers on Thursday. Speaking my language.   The beer Togo: gosh almighty this is the place to get craft beer, but careful they aren't all cheap! They also have Pacifico in a can and a fabulous selection of commercial and domestic beer. They have fridges full of cans from breweries EVERYWHERE, not just Texas beer. They then have a whole large bottle section and more. If you like to try new brews - get here now!   If this didn't sell you ^ the people were also tremendously helpful and personable. Stop in if you are nearby and be ready to turn from skeptical to a regular. Shout out to the owners of Southern Heights (my fave brewery if you read that review) for introducing us to this place."

Our go-to pizzas are the pepperoni and the Hawaiian with pineapple and ham. We always ask for extra crispy crust and it never disappoints.  This time I got a great local craft growler that we enjoyed when we got home with the pizza.  Really hate to see our local neighborhood places struggling to stay afloat with just take out. Glad the stay at home orders are easing up.  I still ask fellow Yelpers to tip extra these days.  We'll continue to be regulars here.  Cheers!"

They have the coolest draft beers on tap of just about any place I have been! And they do not cost a ton either!  I got the temptress mole and at 13% alcohol it was only 6$!!!! WOWZERS!  They constantly roll in and out different beers on tap and have a large cooler filled with other interesting types too... just can't go wrong!  Their wine selection is something to be cherished too... seriously... you have got to try this place!  Since the last time I was here it does seem to have slipped a bit in maintenance... light in hall way not working, icee machines down... cooler for sodas really low... and the extra TVs in eating area are off... I think we need to rally for this establishment!  For a gas station restaurant it is really so very very cool! You can't beat the selection! I don't want to see this place fold up... it truly is a coo cool coo place!"

My Son came and asked me what else I wanted since they didn't have either so I walked up and asked what they had.  The guy brings a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and said I have this. I laughed and said ok let me get a glass please. So if you specialize in wine, why not educate your bartenders on wine. There seemed to be only 3 bottles out of wine they were pouring.  Pizza was good. It was a busy Friday and everyone just seemed too busy and not customer friendly at all. I guess you have to be a regular and sit at the bar to get smiles."

If you're looking for hard liquor, take a look a their selections. If you are looking for beer or wine, go somewhere else. They used to have a good stock of specialty, quality beer and wine. For example, they used to have a good selection of micro-brewery beers, but now storied brands like Pabst Blue Ribbon seem to be the taking up most of the shelf space. The quality of wines have slid as well. My last visit there a couple days ago for Rieslings resulted in looking through a selection of less than 10 choices, all of which I was unfamiliar. The recommendations by staff resulted in two bottles ... one of which had lovely hints of chemicals and gasoline (lots of TDN; obviously a late harvest grape that had decomposition of the veins within the grape) ... and the other bottle offered notes of cat pee ... absolutely disgusting cheap, creamy crap. MD 20/20 would be a step up. I'd like to support my local business, but I'm quite done ... no more ... I'll make the trip across town to Total Wine from now on."

The exact same bottle that always costs me $17.29 at Spec's cost me $25.97 here. That's $8.68 more...over 50% higher! How much are you willing to pay for convenience? Since my office is right near a Spec's, I will continue to plan ahead and enjoy the 33% savings. If you are willing to pay the \"convenience fee,\" I will say this store was nice inside (like a Twin Liquors) and the guy at the counter was very friendly. My only complaint is the prices, but that determines where I shop. I'm a frugal person."

This isn't a huge chain so while it may be slightly higher in price on some things, the convenience, friendly staff and knowing I'm supporting a local make it totally worth it! If they don't have it, they'll get it for you. Highly recommend"

I went in, picked up what I wanted and headed to the counter.  Once there I was questioned about a bottle of peach ciroc.  I told the guy I never touch any ciroc, but he insisted I did over and over again.  A few minutes later a few other fellas walked up to the counter and he realized he had made a mistake.  I would have been ok with this if it were not for the way the clerk presented himself and kepting insisting it was me who picked up the bottle.  I was being accused of stealing a bottle of liquor wearing shorts and a pull over sweat shirt.  Where I could of concealed the bottle is a mystery to me.  Once he realized he was wrong he made a weak apology and continued on.  I will never visit this store again!  Just unacceptable..."

She's not friendly, never smile and short in words, never say nice things like thank you, have a nice day .....after we made the payment/pickup. She's cold and means! She will ask you to show your order on the phone if match with the bag that you are grabbing but the way she did not so friendly.   Others staff is perfect, they're professional and friendly.   Food is good especially the fish dish. Fries as well. Love the new drinks that they are selling on the fridge. But if you use delivery service it won't taste the same.   3 stars because of that Asian waitress, otherwise 5. If manager or owner read this, please consider this waitress. She doesn't have a service mind!! She should find a new job that fit her style. I used to come here at least once every two weeks also order through DoorDash for pickup and sometime delivery, but I hate to see that waitress, so I might stop all."

We had to wait just a couple of minutes because they were getting a big influx of guest - seems like some sort of dance show had just let out. Gary was our server and even though my favorite pasta has been discontinued (RIP blackened chicken pasta) and they were out of my second choice item (turkey burger) Gary had a great attitude and solid recommendations and solutions to keep the night on track. I ended up getting the half rack rib special with a beer that he recommended to pair and of course everyone was more than happy to share my pizooki. Give it a try, nice staff, quick service, solid food and open late."

We've tried to eat here on three occasions in the past month, every time we walk in, maybe 1 in 4 tables is seated. Then they tell us it's going to be a 1-2 hour wait. I'm all about social distancing and being safe during these times but that's ridiculous. It's either bad management unable to staff the location or just an EXTREME overabundance of social distancing. We gave them two chances and the third time we're done. We'll just go ahead and drive to the next nearest one and get seated sooner. Every single couple/group that came in during the 5 minutes we spent there had the same appalled look on their face when they saw the place practically empty and an hour wait."

                "description": "BJ's was always one of my favorite restaurants, but not this location.  I ordered a family bundle meal directly from their website.  I got a call from the door dash driver a bit later and he said they had no record of my order.  I texted him a photo of my e-receipt and he showed the manager.  Apparently they didn't have the Shrimp Scampi -Tri-Tip Bundle I ordered at this particular restaurant so the order cancelled automatically and I got no notification from the restaurant.  The Door Dash driver had to cancel my order and he said someone from BJ's would be calling me.  They called and said they could have another bundle with a different item ready and cooked in about 15 minutes.  I said ok. that works.    30 minutes later I get a phone call asking when I was coming to pick up the order? I said I ordered delivery, not pick-up. He said, \"you have to order on our website to get delivery.\"  I told him I did the first time.  He just, \"Oh\".  So I said, \"So you are not going to deliver this?\" he said he couldn't.  So I just said refund my money and this is the last time I will be going to this store.    You would think that maybe a manager would have called back to apologize or something, but nothing.  I just hope I get my refund.    Good luck with this store!"

We arrived and then, found out that they had not taken that down reserve ahead of time option, so I reserved a seat for nothing, still waited about 40 minutes.  By the way, you have to be present to get on the waitlist like any other restaurant in town.  When it was time to be seated there probably 5 empty 2 top tables, and they were seating us next to a large party of 10!  Hello, can we move a few tables down?  So we picked another table and sat.  The host came and asked if we would like to move to a booth once it's cleaned as he pointed to the table, never were moved, and the original hostess that sat us brought our silverware and we assumed we were no longer moving.  Waited 15 minutes for our beer after waiting for our server.  Placed our order at 8:25 and got our food within 15-20 minutes, luckily!  By then, we were starving.

They brought out the alfredo sauce separately when I asked and it was awful, probably straight out of a jar. The croutons in the salad were all burned. Both of the steaks we got were very tough and chewy, although the flavor was not bad on this. The chicken Parmesan had no seasoning. I'm not even exaggerating, I don't think there was anything on it, same with the broccoli that came with it, but the white cheddar mashed potatoes were good. They also brought out another incorrect item, which I wouldn't normally mention because when I pointed it out they did correct it, but I mention it because it just shows more how much of a mess the kitchen is. My server was very friendly and attentive, did not have an issue with service, just quality of food. This meal cost $100 and I'm cringing over it. I wouldn't recommend going and I don't see myself coming back, personally. Which is a bummer because I liked this place! Definitely should have just gone to Longhorn!"

My boyfriend (who has a darker skin tone and has dreads as well might I add) and I go in and still, there's no wait time and it was not busy.  The woman at the front says we can sit anywhere near the bar and a server will be right with us. We sit anywhere as she said we could and about 3 servers walk pass by us and we make eye contact with all of them, multiple times, and they still don't serve us and I feel it had to do with our skin tone. Again, it was NOT busy and the servers were tending to all of the other tables but ours. We just got up and left after about 10 minutes of not being acknowledged. Writing this review to give others a heads up that if you have a different skin complexion you may not get served either :) There are much better businesses to support and this establishment is not recommended."

I've even had the pleasure of being served by the owners themselves. I always LOVE a good NY style pizza spot, and this is that and beyond. They have Gyros, calzones, wings, and an impressive line of draft beer.  P.S-- try the cannolis, they're bombski.  Thank you guys for being awesome!!!!! See yah soon."

It took 14 minutes from the time I ordered till the time it is ready even though they were very busy!  The quality of this pizza is amazing I was very very surprised they also have other items such as wings and whatnot.  I suggest if you're in the area it's a must have if you're in the mood for pizza."

The sauce has good flavor and it was delivered really fast. Very close to New York pizza but the crust is a little thicker! When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it looked 10x better than the pizza in some of the other pictures. I think because my slices were jumbo, that they are a bit thinner than their other pizza (which I love)"

I like to make homemade pizza from time to time as well and always like trying new places. I told my husband I was tired of getting pizza from the same places and wanted something new. This restaurant has almost all good reviews and they tout being voted best pizza in Round Rock. I really don't understand why. We got two kinds of pizza and two appetizers. The pizza was undercooked and you could still see the shredded cheese which was not fully melted. Flavor and quality was not great either. Definitely not legit NY style pizza. The garlic knots have no noticeable taste of garlic due to all the other herbs they put on them. Service was fine, but disappointed based on how many people think this is the best pizza. Based on reading other reviews, I am Expecting a rebuttal from the owner in 3, 2, 1...."

I guess they were busy and their air conditioning was out so I guess Monday specials and beer were out too.  The pizza was good, but I felt it was overpriced.  The wings were okay (not as crispy as I'd like), didn't care for the blue cheese much or warm celery/carrots."

Once the pizza arrived it was piping hot so hot that when we took one slice of pizza all the toppings started coming off.  So we let it cool down I love the crust I have to say it was very crunchy my kids enjoyed their pizza. The other thing I loved was the sauce yummy very fresh almost like home made.  The only thing I did not like about the philly cheese steak pizza was that it fell apart.  The pizza in general has a good amount of topping and ratio for each slice.  Overall not bad I may try something else next time but my kids pizza was good"

For $20, I felt that was a great deal. I did feel it was a little pricey to add extra toppings on the pizza. I ordered it from my house which was about 15 minutes away and when I arrived everything was ready to go and bagged up waiting for me. A guy brought it out to my car curbside and made sure I had a mask on, which I appreciated for his health and mine. Everything was still hot when I got home and the pizza and wings were devoured quickly. I ate the chicken caesar salad the next day and it was tasty and fresh as well. Would recommend trying this local pizza shop!"

One day my spouse and I walked in to dine in there and service was awesome. The polite, welcoming male told us to have a seat and they'd take our order. We came back days later(to dine in)  and the tables were dirty, it wasn't very busy btw. We sat down looked at the menu. 10 minutes pass and no one helped us AT ALL. they didn't talk to us, acknowledge us. So I went up to just order while everyone stood around. I'm not sure what the process is here ?? But they sure as heck weren't going to come to us.  Well, as I ordered I felt so uncomfortable and as if our presence was an inconvience. 2 other times during this SAME week ( separate days) i walked in to order pretty large orders for my kids final days of school. Similar service was given. No one bothers to greet you and one of the workers said he'd help us when he had a chance. Ok sure, yeah we waited. Lol no biggie I guess?   Long story short we enjoyed the food and spent a lot of money here in just one week but eh the service here convinced me not to come back. Good food, inconsistent rude staff simple as that."

Samantha called me back the same day and I was able to place the order with her. My order was finalized with her via email.  I ordered a tray of salad, a tray of ziti, pizzas, wings and fries. On the day of the party, pick up went smoothly. Food was ready on time and they helped my husband bring the food out to the car. Of course the food was delicious and all the hot items were still hot. They even gifted my son a present for his birthday. A very thoughtful touch. Overall a great experience! Pizza Delight will continue to have my business."

                "description": "Ordered a pizza from them today and they either dropped it or tossed it at my door like a newspaper. Then when contacted they said they were too busy to replace it and refused to refund me. Well this place has lost all future business from me. Try to help the local pizza place and they obviously don't care about their customers.  Goodbye pizza delight, never again!   Update: I find it amusing that this establishment tries to blame their own internal issues on others instead of taking responsibility for bad customer service (see Pizza  delight comment below) We had no problem contacting the vendor. Let me be clear. It was Pizza Delight that delivered the pizza, not a 3rd party. It was Pizza Delight that refused to replace the Pizza(within a 50.00 order) because they said they were too busy and it was Pizza Delight that refused to provide a refund for the broken Pizza. Any local business that cannot take responsibility for poor customer service, is not the local business I choose to help in these current times. As for 3rd party vendors, it was that vendor that stepped up with a credit to my account since the local establishment refused."
