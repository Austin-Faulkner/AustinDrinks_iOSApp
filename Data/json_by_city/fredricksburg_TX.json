My husband and I both left thinking they were the best we've ever had.   They have comfy couches, delicious cocktails, classy yet low key ambiance and incredible live music on the weekends. We will make sure we come by every time we are in town in the future. Highly recommend."

The environment is amazing. During the day, it's very chill with soothing jazz music, and very fun in the nighttime! A bartender named Cynthia was very lovely with everyone. She did her best to facilitate a good and fun environment while making sure everyone's needs were met, no matter how busy it was! The rest of the staff was also very lovely and helpful! Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great time :-) Their pecan pie moonshine is also to die for!"

                "description": "I'll start with the bad. The flavor of the alcohol in the cocktails is just off. There was a flavor I can't pinpoint. Husband said that they use the shine as the base in all their spirits then just flavor it to taste like rum, whiskey, gin, etc. I had a Diet Coke and whiskey to start which had the off flavor then switched to the shine and diet. Same weird flavor. Husband had the famed smoked old fashioned. He loves them normally but due to the off flavor, he didn't even finish it. The strange flavor reminded me of an old piece of charred wood. Not really what I wanted or liked in my whiskey or shine. Strange.  The good. The charcuterie was amazing! Amazing selection of meats and cheeses and a sprinkling of olives and almonds. ReAlly perfect for 2 for a light dinner. We also had the bread and olive oil plate which was to die for! Loved the herbs and such in the oil.  The place was packed! It was a Friday night and it was raining so to be expected though. We got in early enough to snag a nice seat on a sofa. Zero Covid precautions which didn't bother us. We are adults. We know the risk and assume any and all risks when we leave the house. But the off flavor in the spirits made this place a no go for us on future visits. Such a shame."

Was charged in Dec and never received the package, charged and quickly refunded in Jan for an unknown reason, and finally charged and actually received the shipment in Feb. Getting the guy who does memberships on the phone to discuss anything is nearly impossible and after speaking to him, I still never received the missing package. Every other wine club I joined while in town was a lot easier to deal with and I've had no issues. Save yourself the hassle and skip this one!  UPDATE: They still won't return my phone calls and I haven't been reimbursed or sent the missing package"

                "description": "Bad vibes all around. Came here for a glass of wine and felt very uncomfortable. Gentlemen at the bar helping me was very rude. Other reviewers have mentioned they felt discriminated against and I would believe that to be true. A previous reviewer mentioned they were called \"wetbacks\" when asked why they couldn't be served 45 mins before closing. As an Asian American I can't help but wonder if I would have been treated this way had I been white. Very unfortunate considering everyone else in town is super friendly and welcoming. Also this place has no precautions against Covid. My partner and I were told to take off our masks because \"we don't wear those around here\". Let's face it no one really likes wearing masks but that kind of attitude is uncalled for."

                "description": "This is our favorite watering hole in Fredericksburg, an establishment we visit each time we are in town.  Our latest was for New Years Eve, a welcome refuge from the wet cold weather that prevailed.  There are actually two bar areas, the first seems to offer wines, and a second toward the rear which features their own distillery whiskies and such.  The atmosphere is definitely inviting, with muted lighting, with seating at the bars or at table with comfortable barrel chairs.  This time of the year, the mood was festive, with everyone of good holiday cheer.   Be prepared to strike up a conversation with locals or visitors, many of the latter bearing their recently purchased Main Street treasures.  The first time we visited, we met the owner of The Christmas Store, a Fredericksburg landmark, and passed the time listening to his history of this wonderful little town.  Notice, upon passing the first bar, a diminutive version of the famous \"A Christmas Story\" leg lamp..always a great conversation piece!   If you enjoy a good whiskey, these Elk Store offerings are quite remarkable.  My favorites are the Blended Whiskey, and the Charter:  both smooth on the palate, never harsh, and both aged in oak. To add a special treat, the ElK Store has one of the most talented mixologists/bartenders/distillers we have encountered.  This gentleman, Travis,  brings learned skill as well as pleasing theater while he prepares your drink.  To the point, one drink that has disappointed in my past experience, has been the Old Fashioned.  He challenged me to find fault with his version:  everyone at the bar watched while he flamed a citrus peel over his mix, then allowed this liquid gold to finish in a smoke chamber.  Well, he was correct:  his version was to die for.  Even so, he further wowed my girlfriend with his version of  Irish Coffee.  His people skills are exceptional, and it is no wonder many patrons prefer to sit at his bar during their visit.  All said, this is a terrific place to pass time, comforted in a cozy environment, thirsts slaked with satisfying libations.  We will definitely return.  Enjoy!!"

He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber.

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

Planning to visit four wineries on a Sunday afternoon, I hired Vintage Car Service so we wouldn't have to worry about becoming safety hazards on the road.

She helped us rearrange our schedule a bit when our visit at one winery went longer than planned (that's on me - I tried to cram too much into an afternoon).  THIS is the way to do a wine tour.

I'm so glad I did.   1) personalized service. Josh took us to 4 wineries personalized to our tastes. Your tour is likely going to be nothing like ours. If you want a distillery tour they can do that too.   2) new, clean vehicle.  My mom has mobility issues. Getting in and out of a shuttle isn't the easiest. We could relax in this SUV and she had no issues getting out of it.   3) private service. Josh was our photographer, tour guide and even purse holder for the day. He knows a lot about wine! At the end of our tour he brought in all of our wine! We could do things at our own puce.   4) the price was comparable to other services. The price does not include tastings but that is ok. Sometimes you just want a glass or two.   Overall, I would highly recommend this service!"

The service we received was beyond expectations. All the wineries we went we had quick service, we decided when we wanted to go to the next winery, they gave us each goodie bags filled with snacks and waters, annnd they recommended a delicious place to eat dinner afterwards and even dropped us off there."

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes). Overall a great experience!"

We started at William Chris, headed to Pedernales and ended at Augusta Vin. The 15 passenger van was great for our group of 11. They offered water and took care of checking us in at each winery. David was a complete gentleman and carried all of our purchases and secured them in the van while we enjoyed our time tasting the different wines. He even dropped us off downtown so we would be on time for our dinner reservation."

                "description": "Do NOT recommend! We booked a tour for 8 people and everything was a mess from the beginning. We were told we would be upgraded to a 15 passenger bus. A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

We came with a group of girls for a birthday party and it was helpful to have someone driving us from winery to winery. The shuttle goes to every stop so expect it to take awhile to get places. When decided to end the day at 4.0 which is on the far side of town. Being tired, it was a long and bumpy ride back with a full shuttle and having to stop at all the locations to see if anyone wanted to get off or see if anyone wanted on. We usually go by ourselves and drive our own car and are just responsible about making sure we are good to drive before leaving anywhere."

                "description": "It could have been a fantastic experience if there is no concerns for Covid-19. DON't BOOK the bus if you expect reasonable measures enforced to keep passengers safe. We were extremely uncomfortable the whole time while riding the bus.   First, the bus was operating at 100% capacity, there was no social distancing at all. We were asked to wear face masks when we boarded the bus but this rule was not enforced. Secondly, on the way back from the wineries, half of the people on the bus was not wearing face masks and the driver turned a blind eye. There was no reminder of wearing face mask or any attempt from the driver.   We were very disappointed at the almost nonexistent safety measures. We made a complaint to the staff after we returned, however the staff/owner didn't seem to care nor show interests in addressing our concerns. He told us they did the best they could and gave us a partial refund ( refunded $60 and we paid $89) which felt like he just wanted us to leave. They claim on the website that they follow social distancing guideline and require passengers to wear mask, which was false. Don't book this if you are cautious and don't want to put your and your family's health at risk!!!"

They offer two different routes and have shuttles running all day. For $30 a person, you can enjoy a carefree day of sipping and tasting, and not having to worry about driving. It's a hop on and off shuttle and shuttles arrive about every 10-15 min. at every stop along the route, all day, from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays. Great value! Great idea!"

Since the morning was not very crowded, the drivers were willing/able to drop us off wherever we wanted on the route. Keep in mind that this shuttle only goes to a specific list of wineries, and therefore you will miss some of the other really great places along 290. And it's Saturdays only. But we knew that, and therefore used Friday to visit some other places on our own. Due to covid reopen rules, many wineries required reservations (book at least a week in advance!) and had limited capacity. By the late afternoon, each shuttle got pretty full. But we never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a shuttle."

We did not as there was a bus there when we walked up. Check-in was under a minute because we booked ahead.They keep all your purchases with tags for easy pickup at the end.  Drivers were friendly. We even had a flat tire on one of the buses, but none of us even knew it until we had pulled into the next stop and the driver informed us that he had a flat but had called for an empty bus that had pulled in behind him at the same stop. So, any of us that were going on, just had to get off and back on the empty shuttle.  Our favorite wineries were Becker (beautiful lawn) and Fat Ass (great live band and dancing area)."

                "description": "I'm confused why this has such good reviews, perhaps because the expectations are low. The shuttle does not come consistently at all, which makes this difficult. If not enough people are getting off at the winery you are at and want to be picked up from, you will not be able to get on if the shuttle is full.   The largest complaint, though, is that they let people pack on the shuttle when there are no seats near the end of the dat. Our shuttle home had about 6 drunk women standing in the middle of the aisle and they were falling all over everyone the entire time... not exactly a safe riding scenario. In addition, Stephanie was incredibly rude and inconsiderate upon our arrival home for the pickup of goods. If you care about customer service and reviews I would recommend reconsidering her employment."

True to their word, 290 shuttle stops by for pick-ups every 15 minutes. We never waited long, and even if some buses were full, another one was right behind it. They also offer a wine bottle check. Leave a labeled bottle with your driver, and it's available for pickup at the end of your day.   This was a girl's trip, but we plan to visit with boyfriends again this summer. We will definitely look into 290's private tours.   ***shoutout to our driver(s) for remaining pleasant, despite driving a bus full of wine-drunk women***"

I had the best experience with the driver and I will never get around Fredericksburg any other way.  I left my phone in my seat when I was getting off the bus to go to Fiesta, and the driver walked the isles and made it a point to hold my phone for me. He even described me to the manager to ensure I was the right person picking up the phone.   If you're thinking about getting a ticket, stop thinking and swipe that card! 100% worth it."

My only qualm is the price - could be a little cheaper since the wineries are so close!   They pick you up right in front of the Pacific Museum on Main Street and then take you down 290, making a stop at selected wineries. They stop at most wineries on the route. There are several busses constantly running, so we never waited longer than 15 minute. Good if you anticipate on getting a little tipsy and don't want to deal with the hassle of driving and parking! They also have complimentary bottle service - you can check in wines that you have purchased and pick them up at the end of the day so you don't have to carry it around.   The only negative thing I have to say about this service is that they don't turn around. If you want to go to a winery that you've passed up or go back to a winery, you have to ride the complete route around."

The check in people made sure we fully understood the route, winery expectations, and the town. Our original shuttle driver got to know us, told us about his journey to Fredericksburg, and gave us recommendations on where to visit.   For $29.99 I would recommend booking a ticket because not only is it convenient but a fun experience. The shuttles pick up every 10 minutes and no need to worry about parking."

But the moment your tour starts, Clint takes away all your worries and concerns, and created a fun atmosphere filled with lots of knowledge and wine tasting! If you're looking for a sommelier who knows his stuff, Clint is your guy! If you want your sommelier to not be pretentious, again, Clint is your guy!

We made awesome memories thanks to Rat Cellar, and would use them again in a heartbeat!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THEM! From the beginning Cayde was a great help with booking and recommending different places and atmospheres. We were looking for a mixture of red and white wines as well as making a stop at a brewery. As this trip was taken to relax a bit we opted to go a more relaxing atmosephere. The three stops that we made were great and weren't typical touristy places which made it even better. Chris was our tour guide and he was awesome!! He gave us recommendations of where to eat, information about the areas, and overall was very personable! We couldn't have asked for a better tour guide, he took all of our bags back to the car, he mentioned that he had umbrellas just in case, and was great about letting us know that he was on his way and that there was a little delay. This company isn't like others, they listen to what you are looking for in the experience and there were no problems! Chris even found our airbnb that was a bit off the beaten path. I would book with them again!"

We love these guys more than ever after going out with Clem for a tour of William Chris, Pecan St Brewery, Hye Rum, and Pedernales.   Clem was a fantastic host for the day! With several years in the Industry and a passion for wine making, we received the red carpet experience! We once again had a great time touring and learning from an expert. They will tell you as much, or as little, as you want to know - but make no mistake, these guys know what they're talking about!  Book your wine tours with Cellar Rat, you'll be in great hands!"

                "description": "Booked a tour with Cellar Rat during the first day of our trip to Fredericksburg since we had never been.  We thought a tour would be a good way to get our bearings.  We stayed just out of town on the west side of 490 so our \"wine\" tour started with a quick tour of main street which was helpful later when making dining decisions and deciding our our tourist stops.  Clint was very knowledgeable about the town, the wineries, wine in general, and very personable.  He had all our stops planned out and tastings booked.  Definitely relaxing to have all that handled for you so you can enjoy your vacation.  The tours are somewhat determined by the agenda/goal of the people on the tour meaning you stops might be different.  I was told some tours are based on the best views, best wines, and possibly distillery tours if that is of interest.  We wanted an idea of what the area had to offer which took us to Kuhlman, William Chris, and Astris.  We also had some samples during lunch at Hye Market which was a great stop as well.   Several stops included a tour of the grounds and a behind the scene look at the production side of wine making.  We ended the trip that day with about a dozen bottles of wine, a mix of reds and white, which is a testament to the quality of the stops and wines the area has to offer as we primarily drink dry red wines; typically pinot noirs.  Would definitely recommend Rat Cellar and look forward to touring with them again next trip."

Cadye provided a quick and thoughtful response to our initial inquiry and walked us through creating the best tour for our group. She was patient while I got consensus with the group of which wineries we wanted to visit.   On the day of the tour, Chris picked us up on time and gave us an overview of what we could expect throughout the day. We had a lot of questions and he answered them well.   Our group stopped at Kuhlman Cellars, William Chris and Pedernales. Having worked in the industry, Chris was able to get us some \"behind the scenes\" looks at the wineries. He also was patient when we wanted to have another glass at certain wineries. Not to mention, he was always willing to help us document the trip with a picture!  I can't forget to mention we also had lunch at Hye Market where we got to taste some of the Cellar Rat wines! They were great! The restaurant itself is in a post office that is still operating and looks like it did back when it opened decades ago. Chris was also sure to make sure we had snacks and water throughout our trip!  I would highly suggest booking Cellar Rat Wine Tour to learn more about Texas wine culture and the area."

Chris, our guide was excellent and went out of his way to accommodate us.  He is also knowledgeable regarding the wine, spots, and was extremely profesional and nice.  They made accommodations to pick up and drop us off where we were staying.  He kept the van cool for us and our wine during this hot weather.  He also kept us hydrated by having plenty of cold water bottles handy.  Highly recommend booking a tour with Cellar rat wine tours.  You will not be disappointed."

You are treated to such a fun experience with delicious wines (and not to mention, plenty of learning), good food, and a great travel buddy and conversationalist to boot. Some may argue the company is pricey considering the available wine shuttles, but it is SO worth it. You get plenty of attentiveness, the day is laid-back with ZERO planning on your part, and you get home at the end of the day feeling great and hopefully, with some delicious wine.  I love Cellar Rat Wine Tours and would highly recommend to anyone hoping to check out the wine scene around the Fredericksburg area."

The company was very helpful in setting up where we should go...ex- I said my sister and I only liked dry wines. Out of 19 samples...only ONE wine was sweet!

We had a 11 people with us for the tour so were in their largest tour van, and even with the large number of people Clem was able to keep the tour feeling small and intimate.   2 of the 11 people were very interested in the actual wine making process and Clem to the extra time to discuss more in depth the process as well as show the group the actual wine cellar where the wine was stored.   Lunch was provided in the cost and this made this tour group even more attractive to us, as all the other tour groups we looked at did not provide that.   If you're looking for more of a personalized tour from an experienced professional, this tour is definity with the price of admission.   Cheers!"

I liked his conversational style, and he was able to answer everyone's questions. The tour bus was very well-kept and clean, and I was impressed that the tour started and ended exactly on time.   There was not quite as much walking as I expected, since it was billed as a \"walking tour.\" However, I'm not surprised because we did visit so many locations (a mission, the King William district, and drove through the Pearl) that we had to drive between. Melvin packed a lot of sightseeing and history into two hours! I learned a lot about the areas of San Antonio that I visit frequently, so I am very happy with the tour. I would love to try more San Antonio Detours in the future, especially with Melvin. Two big thumbs up!"

We had 3 wine tour stops and then Luckenbach, and it was soooo fun!  All 3 places were each different than the other which gave us a great variety. Thank you John for a wonderful time!"

It was so relaxing to sit back and enjoy the day with friends, all while knowing every detail had been taken care of.  This coming from a very \"type A\" personality is a huge 5 star! We did the \"red rose\" package, touring 3 wineries and had a few hours in Luckenbach.  John was friendly, fun and a great host. All we had to do is drink wine, visit with friends and enjoy the day! If you are looking for a fun experience, try Yellow Rose! We will be back next year to do it all over again!"

                "description": "Do not use this \"tour\"!! It is cheaper to pay the tasting fees and hire your own driver. The owner is greedy and a complete A. We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time. It was awful and we will never do it again."

The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.

                "description": "Brayden and Deb are an amazing duo. Very personable and easy to work with. They aim to exceed your wildest wine tour expectations! The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

Deb (co-owner and our tour guide) was absolutely AMAZING and she made sure that we had everything we needed!!!  Seriously can't wait to book again next time we are in Fredericksburg and we have already decided it needs to be a yearly trip for us!   They were so informative and helpful with picking out which vineyards would be best for us and answered all of my questions quickly and with helpful details and suggestions!!"

                "description": "We had the absolute BEST time with Brayden on our tour. From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

They were on time and very accommodating, went as far as going to buy a stool for my friend who has trouble getting up and down the steps to the van. The wineries they took us to were exactly what we asked for. We never felt rushed and they handled everything for us and we never had to lift a finger to do anything. I would 100% recommend them and will definitely be using them again!"

They made the trip so easy, worry-free, and fun! Brayden and Deb were super communicative and gave us a wide variety of wineries to choose from. We ended up going to Baron's Creek, Signor, and Augusta Vin. Deb was our tour guide and took care of absolutely everything and was such a joy to be around. If you are headed to Fredericksburg and wanting to visit the wineries, you won't regret choosing to book through 830 Elevated!!"

                "description": "I came across 830 when our bed and breakfast cancelled our room and wine tour reservation (due to remodeling) a month before our 10 year anniversary trip to Fredericksburg. I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

We were able to customize our winery stops which was not the experience we had previously with a different wine tour company. We spent the day with our group of four instead of getting shuttled around with strangers to fill seats (which I really prefer)! We requested a charcuterie board in the vehicle and Brayden picked it up while we were at one of our stops. We will definitely be back and use 830 Elevated for all of our future trips!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

We had a group of 6 ladies on our trip and it was easy to communicate and book our tour with Moon's Voyages. We did the half-moon tour on a Saturday morning/afternoon. Ginger arrived at our Airbnb with the bus on time and after picking up other people at their various locations, we reached 4.0 Cellars for our first tasting. Our second tasting was at Hye Meadow Winery followed by lunch at Hye Market, where our lunches were ready on the table for us! We finished the day at Fat Ass Ranch and Winery before all being taken back to our respective locations. All 3 tastings were amazing! We never felt rushed or that we were on any type of time crunch. We were able to enjoy every glass and had no worries about who would have to be the designated driver. Ginger was so much fun and the absolute sweetest! She made our tour a blast by keeping us safe and making us laugh!"

                "description": "If you're staying In Fredericksburg and want to do a wine tour, be sure to call up Brandon at Moon's Vineyard Voyage. My boyfriend surprised me with this during our weekend getaway. Brandon was super friendly and knowledgeable of the area and the different things to do in Fredericksburg. He picked everyone up from where they were staying, which was awesome. The first place he took us was to was Fiesta Winery. This place was my absolute favorite! We were allowed to pick 6 wines to try and we got to keep our tasting glasses. I got lucky and liked all 6 of mine! The next stop was the Garrison Brothers Distillery. Bourbon on a wine tour?! Super unique. This consisted of a tour of the distillery and we learned how bourbon was made. We got to try it every stage of the process. And they also taught us how to enjoy a glass of bourbon. It wasn't my cup of tea, however it was a cool experience and my boyfriend loved it! For lunch, we had some awesome sandwiches at the Hye Market. Super yummy! Our last stop was the Hye Meadow Winery. Also a cute winery. We had such a great time on this tour. Brandon gave us his card and told us to call him directly if we ever want to do it again, that way we don't do the same tour twice. We live up the road in Austin, so we definitely will be coming back very soon!  Pro tip, eat before you go on this tour! You will be drinking a lot!"

The gentleman at Sister Creek who served our wine did great. Brandy was very knowledgeable, personable, professional and kind. She is a walking wealth of wine/vineyard information. If you're looking to book a tour, short or long, I highly recommend this company! We were given the option for her to provide a little info and just let us vibe or provide us with everything. I love all things wine so I went for it all! I wasn't disappointed. (Btw she took magnificent pictures for us as well)."

Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

I highly recommend doing this tour if you're in town visiting or live in San Antonio. They also give military discounts"

Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

We did a private tour with just 3 and it was completely affordable, which was my biggest concern off the bat. Communication was impeccable from the get-go and our tour guide Matt was such a blast. We hit up 3 wineries and a distillery that made moonshine. Each one was small and unique where we were really able to  converse with the staff and talk about the wines. Due to us having a small group we never felt rushed and when we asked for an extra few minutes, Matt easily obliged. I will definitely be going back for another tour!!"

We did the tour that consisted of two wineries and lunch in Fredricksburg. It was great!  Brandy and Matt think of everything! We were picked up in a clean van right at our hotel, so don't worry if you don't have a car! Matt even bring out a step stool so you don't have strain to get into the car. I didn't need it necessarily, but I did enjoy that extra touch. They gave us goodie bags while we drove to the country side. Matt is very knowledgeable and is a great guide of the area. He is full of little facts about the area!   The wineries we went to were very cool! Sister Creek was in an old cotton gin and more personal. Becker's was more upscale and large. we ended up getting 6 bottles of wine altogether. I was so surprised by the amount of good wine grown in Texas! Who knew?!!  Pros:  Brandy and Matt think of everything!  Don't worry about paying anything at the wineries- they take care of that! Transportation Good wine Great tour of the area Brandy and Matt are friendly and great at conversation They really know their stuff and love to explain anything about wine!  Cons:  I had a hankering for some cheese! But that's all I can think of!"

Rick did a great job of taking care of our purchases and labeling our bags.  Plenty of complimentary water and snacks on board.  Our bus held 12 people but we were all comfortable.

He made sure our wine bottles made it back to the incredible and comfy van provided along with any other purchases. Steve made sure we were taken care of at each winery and the lunch provided was so yummy! We got so lucky to have such a great group and can't wait to do it again in the future!"

Our tour included visiting 3 wineries: Hilmy Cellars, Untamed, and Ron Yates all along the 290 corridor- all excellent btw and we finished with dinner at Bryan's 290 in Johnson City - outstanding! Lee thought of every detail to make our experience special from roses for the ladies to snacks, water and some special bottles of wine. He couldn't have been more attentive or enjoyable. Thank you Lee and Texas Wine Tours!!"

                "description": "We booked our wine tour during spring break and had such a great time. Our driver Bruce was so great, he showed up at our house exactly on time, he was so attentive to our group and was super friendly. Along the way, as we toured and shopped he was right there to take our purchase to the bus and took care of everything for us.  We visited four wineries, and had lunch, and while we had a great time thanks to Bruce and the other couples on our tour, I wasn't all that impressed with the \"wineries\". I've never liked Texas wine and still don't. First of all, these aren't \"wineries\", they're all tasting rooms. The grapes aren't even grown in this area. They all seemed to just want to get through the tasting, and sell you wines by the bottle. One \"winery\" had our group of 8 set up in their \"library\" which was nice and private, but our host kept running in and out because they were short handed and he was helping at the front while also doing our tasting. The other places don't even allow you to sit at the bar while tasting, you had to stand the entire time which wasn't good for my cousin who was recovering from a back injury.  Overall, my review of Texas Wine Tours is 5 stars because they really took care of us. I wasn't impressed the the fake wineries and their push to sell wines and not really educate. Maybe they can't educate much on their wines because they aren't actually making them there. I would still recommend the tour in Fredericksburg if you are looking for something fun to do with a group. It was great to have someone else to drive and worry about the schedule and let us just relax and enjoy our time."

                "description": "DO NOT GO HERE!!!!   **Texas wine tours in Fredericksburg **  Please share since they keep deleting all the reviews.   Also, if you know me.... you know that I NEVER blast a business like this. EVER. This owner was SO disgusting and disrespectful to me.   I really hate to post this... but the owner of this place was completely disrespectful and out of line with me when I called (the second time, because the first time they were ok with everything). More than half of the girls scheduled to take the wine tour, came down with covid and or was exposed to it and was told we must quarantine for 2 weeks. We never ever ever planned on canceling, but once the all time high hit texas (2nd wave) , especially Houston, where we ALL live, AND almost every single girl was exposed or now tested positive, we sadly needed to cancel and would re-schedule at a later date. The owner proceeded to tell me that he would give me a gift card and that they will not give me my money back. I told him I would be more than happy to still pay the driver their tip, but we have no idea when this covid stuff will get everything back to any type of normal. I told him that I did not want a almost $3,000 gift card, I would like my money back because I am unsure of a future date and if every girl could make that date. We still plan on going, but just not knowing when or how many girls will be able to attend. He screamed at me and told me that he will not give me any money back so I then proceeded to tell him that we will all come and still attend if that's how he wants to do business-- he would be selfishly putting his driver, the other people there, and all the wineries in danger. Of course, we would NEVER do that, because we are respectful and honorable humans. After I said that to him, he then says \"I'm not dealing with this today, you can call tomorrow\" AND HUNG UP ON ME!!! We are all moms of young children and were told by our family doctors and or a testing site to lock away for 2 weeks. I understand that they have to make money, but also, COVID is KILLING people, shutting down businesses, canceling weddings, etc etc and I have yet to find a vendor type of place that did not give people that literally tested POSITIVE and or was exposed and not showing symptoms just yet, their money back for a \"STATE WIDE DISASTER\". On top of that, we paid for a lunch for that day, all the wine tastings... which they will not lose money on because WE ARE NOT USING ANY OF THAT, therefore, they DO NOT HAVE TO BUY IT!  Our house host refunded us back 100% and has since checked on myself and the other girls. This guy, yelled at me, is willing to put OTHERS AT RISK, and hung up on me.   That's almost $3000 that I'm out for y'all doing absolutely NOTHING. Even offered to still give the driver his $350 tip still! (I'm in the wrong business apparently! I need to be a wine tour driver)   They have also deleted other negative reviews and blocked people on here.   We have a lawyer that is now handling this for us (one of the girls husbands), I have also let our host know to NEVER recommend these people, I'm posting in EVERY bridal page about y'all, sending the knot a review, ALSO, calling every winery y'all are linked up with and letting them know how y'all do business and how unprofessional he was.   Like I said, we would have 100% rebooked at a later date once covid calms down and all the girls are in the clear.... THEN having to find another later date that every girl that paid, can attend.   Sadly, they lost our business all together"

He wanted to congratulate The Bride, thank us for choosing Texas Wine Tours and brought her a very nice bottle of wine.  They took us to 3 Wineries and each one was very different.   We all fell in love with Santa Maria!!  Wonderful boutique winery!! SantaMaria and The Club at BaronsCreek Side were our favorites!!  Jerry, our Guide was over the top wonderful!!  Kept us on track and answered all our questions.  We had such a grand time and I would put both of these wineries on your 'must visit' list!!  I can not wait to visit again and to purchase more wines from these wineries."

They were very accommodating to our needs (date change, pick up, etc.), granted we did do a weekday in January. If you're worried about Covid (which we definitely are), I'd recommend going during the week. We went on a Thursday and there was little to no people at the wineries and we were able to have the van to ourselves! It made it a more comfortable experience for sure. Our driver was Steve and he was awesome. Looking forward to coming back in the summer/fall when everything is in full bloom. 10/10 would book again and ask for Steve!"

We booked for my bachelorette party, and the entire process from booking to the end of the tour was phenomenal. Our driver, Cheryl, stopped by our house the day before our tour to give me a flower and the maid of honor a jam as a thank you. She told us she left plenty of time to take group pictures at the house for us in the morning when she picked us up. Then the morning of the tour, the owner showed up and gave me his well wishes and a bottle of wine! Before even starting the tour, we were blown away by their level of service!   Pick up went super smooth in the morning, and they picked 4 great wineries for our stops. Cheryl came into every winery with us, and spent the entire time making sure everyone was happy and had everything they needed. She would fill our waters, coordinate meals/snacks, and she did it all without anyone having to ask her. If we bought anything at the wineries, she would write our name on the bag, and take it back to the bus and handle the storage. At the end of the tour, she loaded it all up and brought it into our house!   I was so unbelievably impressed with the service provided by Texas Wine Tours and can't wait to have another excuse to go to Fredericksburg and book with them again!"

He picked us up, a few minutes early, from our AirBnB. Mike was the absolute friendliest! He prepared snacks for all of us on the tour, provided water, and made sure everyone was comfortable in the bus. (The bus was very clean and spacious!) At each winery(3 different ones) Mike constantly was refilling our water and kept track of all our purchases. The cherry on top was when Randy, the owner of TWT, made an appearance and gifted a bottle of wine for my husband and I since we were on our honeymoon. It was a wonderful experience and would HIGHLY recommend to anyone!"

You can pick the wineries you want to visit even if you tell them beforehand, or they will offer recommendations. You can drink any bottles you buy on the bus, too!    Wineries definitely vary though. Some let you keep your tasting glass, some don't. Some gave two ounce pours, some barely gave one ounce. Do some research beforehand and make it worth it.  Our tour guide was an older gentlemen and was great!  He had bags for stuff we bought/were given and always loaded everything in the bus in between wineries. We invited him to join us for grilling at our Air bnb that night (wine goes straight our heads) and he said he was busy laying in his recliner and enjoying retirement. Hahahaha definitely the oldest man to have ever rejected us"

He even bought us kolaches and donut holes for breakfast. Picked us up very promptly from our Airbnb in the morning @10, and we were on our way. We did the 4 winery tour which included lunch. We visited SantaMaria, 4.0 cellars, Hilmy, and Safari Winery. Each winery included 5-6 tastings of different wines, and you could pick what type of wines you wanted to try. We loved all the wineries and even bought bottles at all of them, which Darrell stored for us in the bus until the end of the day. The owner, Randy, stopped by at our lunch at 4.0 to introduce himself to us and gift us a bottle of wine for our upcoming wedding! We plan on doing this tour again with more friends next time!

I personally enjoyed being able to ride in their brand new car with seating fit for a king and space to tote all of our collections along the way. If we ever find ourselves back in the area, this will be our first call!"

We received lots of great information and laughs along the way. As a thoughtful bonus, George graciously took photos to ensure memories of our group and surprised us with lovely photos of the places we visited to capture the ambiance as well. The service and professionalism was above what we've experienced in Napa and the Willamette. We will look forward to our next opportunity to enjoy George and Kirschman's service and company."

They are absolutely fantastic. This company is top notch and I highly recommend them. I just came back from visiting the area with my sisters and niece. We booked a 4hr reservation with Kirchman's, so that we could visit 3 wineries for tastings. George, our driver, was so kind and accommodating. He even took photos of us at each winery and texted them all to me. The vehicle used for transporting us was nice and clean. He offered us bottled water and kept our wine purchases safe at our various stops. Whenever we were ready to head to the next location, all I had to do was text him that we were walking out and he rolled right on up in the car. Convenient and awesome customer service! I will definitely use them again next time I visit the area."

He was early for pick up and has a lot of great recommendations for wineries and food! We plan on coming back and using him again. What a nice beautiful day, we will be back!  The vehicle was clean and he wore a mask the whole time - we felt super safe and comfortable (he gave us the option of mask versus no mask - we all chose masked). He also gave us great insight on the area and the sights. We loved it!"

That's what made me nervous.  Alas, fear not! We had a great time. The wineries they selected for us (Slate Mill Collective, Kalasi Winery, and Baron's Creek Winery) offered very different experiences, each of which we enjoyed. We were not rushed at any of the wineries, and our driver was very knowledgeable about each of our stops.  I would book this tour again - highly recommend!"

They picked up/dropped off right at our Airbnb, but you can also get picked up from their office on Main Street. I did wish we were able to pick which wineries we got to visit, but the 4 we got to visit were great. Leland was a fantastic tour guide! He's so personable and really made our day memorable. The restaurant we had lunch in was next door to their office. It wasn't super amazing, but it fine for the price that was included in our package. We were also provided with a charcuterie box in the evening, which hit the spot. This was the most cost-friendly tour in Fredericksburg, and we both really enjoyed our time here!"

                "description": "On August 25, 2021, I booked a private tour for 5 on Saturday Oct 2. It included 4 winery stops, with lunch and tastings. We were flying in from San Francisco, Chicago and Omaha. Having never been to Fredericksburg, we looked for guidance on favorite stops. Whomever answers the phone for this company is unhelpful, rude, short  and clearly hates  her job. She offered no helpful advice and was put out with all of my questions.  I kept the booking, we decided on our own stops, emailed as directed and received NO response as to whether they were able to book our winery selections. I NEVER did get them to respond to an email nor did they phone calls.  7 days prior to arrival, I left 4 voicemails and still no return call.  THREE DAYS prior to arrival  I received a call from this same b*tchy lady now telling me our drivers wife had Covid and we had 2 options...cancel or join a group tour of 18-20 (but she could not tell me which wineries we would visit). She finally confirmed we had reservations at our chosen wineries but we could NOT USE THEM and she was canceling them no matter we decided.   (whaaat???)When I tried to negotiate to keep them if we found our own driver... SHE SAID 'I'M CANCELING YOUR TOUR' and she HUNG UP ON ME!  That left us with nothing 3 days prior to arrival during Fredericksburg's busiest Oktoberfest weekend.  Fast forward a few hours of scrambling to call wineries and drivers explaining this horrible Majesty Tours actions....We ended up at the same wineries with a very pleasant privately hired van driver and here is the best part.....Majesty's price was $1843 and we spent $897 DOING IT OURSELVES ( and this is an apples to apples comparison)!  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They are a huge rip off and are so rude and unprofessional.  I could never get a hold of the owners but Fredericksburg people talk and I know they are sisters KK and Kayla.  I hope you two read this and I wish you'd call me."

They never notified us that one of our requested wineries was unavailable, took us to a cheesy bar place with TERRIBLE wine instead - rather than letting us chose something more fitting. Then we had lunch at their restaurant- buyer be ware of the menu. It's written well but the food was cold, overcooked, and bland. Finally as we were ending our tour, the driver kept talking about how he needed to 'GO' and rushing us out the door. He also appeared very annoyed at any music choices, had no cold water and said he didn't have any ice. The vehicle was a bare van, not any limo style transportation like advertised. For $1600/6 people this was $1000 overpriced. I've tried to get ahold of the company to discuss the experience and they aren't answering."

                "description": "I would not recommend this wine tour. I booked Majesty Tours for my sister's bachelorette weekend in Fredericksburg. I booked Majesty because they had the option for a private tour, none drinkers, and the $140 price for lunch and three wineries was reasonable. I was very disappointed. The tour company advertised a lunch at a local restaurant. The lunch was dry disappointing. Another reviewer described it as a cafeteria for the wine tours with this company; they were right. The tour company's store front is next door to the restaurant and I wouldn't be surprised if they owned it. I expected a cute lunch since there were so many adorable spots to eat. Not the case.  Of the three wineries, only one provided an enjoyable experience. Lunch was terrible.  1. Augusta Vin was the first winery--we really enjoyed it! The patio was amazing and the wine was great. We were only supposed to stay for 45 minutes, but the wine was a little slow to come out so we were there for about an hour and a half. We didn't mind waiting since we had good conversation and the weather was perfect.   2. Arrowhead Creek Wineries--this place was a health and safety hazard. We were horrified. I'll keep it short and leave a review with the winery itself, but basically there was no professional service or health and safety precautions. To start, the outdoor tasting area was where we were out since the indoor one was full. I was sitting by the bar and got to see the kitchen area. It was a mess. There were cracker boxes, empty wine glass, staff purses and cell phones, empty wine bottles, trash etc all over the back counter. When another customer ordered a hummus board, we all watched in horror as the server grabbed the charcuterie board out of the sink water, rinse it and dab it dry it with a batter towel and then put the food straight on it without gloves. She then put gloves on to finish the board. It general it was very chaotic and unprofessional. We left ASAP.  3. RockBox Theater--you read that right, theater. The last winery was NOT a winery. It was the lobby of a concert venue. We were promised three wineries with good ambiance. This was a dark room with 4 high top tables and wines from the grocery store. They paired the wines with food, which I thought would be cool. But we realized the food was not being refrigerated. We arrived at 3:30 and the food was on the counter. The next group came at 5:00 and the food was not refrigerated during that time at all. The food involved tuna tartare and carpaccio which must be refrigerated. It was all look warm so we assume it had been out for a while. Between fasting, our server was cleaning the other tables with a rag. She would pause the cleaning, pour us wine, and then go back to cleaning without washing her hands. Next to the food for the next party we're the dirty wine glasses from the last group. Not appetizing.   Would not recommended majesty tours."

                "description": "So, I want to start this with we had booked the tour ahead of time but the day before Gov. Abbott announced some restrictions due to COVID. Majesty immediately communicated they were figuring things out and would be in touch. So their communication about that was great.  However we were disappointed to learn there were 24 people in our tour and we were on a 55 person bus. Not the safest to be around that many people in a small space. Folks started off wearing masks but by the second stop no one was wearing a mask and it was not enforced by our guide, he didn't wear one either.  The first stop we had to sit with strangers without masks and pour our own wine from bottles. And none of the wines were from Texas, just imported from Africa. Then we bussed back into town to eat lunch at a cafe. It was ok but spent a lot of time going back and forth.  Then we were told we were going to sample cider and drove 30 minutes. We signed up for wine tour not cider tour and we all hate cider. The guy stood on a table and yelled things about each cider while we sat at picnic tables. The final stop was a large tasting room and was a more traditional type where you chose a flight and they walked you through each wine. This was more of what were were expecting and it was at least wine grown from Texas grapes, though not in the hill country. We bought some wine.  The whole tour was almost 7 hours long and there was just a lot of time waiting around.  I hate writing less than stellar reviews but we were so disappointed in the whole experience that I just can't recommend them."

They cancelled our bachelorette party 2 weeks out because  we complained about how rude and difficult they were being when girls were calling to book. We had to call multiple times to get our confirmation email. Prices were misquoted. They have no sense of customer service. So unless you're willing to risk them cancelling your big event 3 weeks out and want to be treated super rudely on the phone, book at one of the dozens of other wine tour companies."

                "description": "Watch your bill!!! I DO NOT recommend Majesty Tours. I went to Fredericksburg with 5 friends to celebrate my birthday. I called the day of and the lady on the phone was nice enough to book for that same day at 1130. Our driver, can't remember his name was AMAZING! However when I saw my credit card statement I noticed they had overcharged me $1027.92 was the total, I called them directly today. The charge should have been $714 ($119 per person). The lady that answered the phone was  BEYOND RUDE, she definitely should not be working in customer service. She went off on me and told me I was lying that the representative \"pretty much always\" disclose all charges and that the fees are more on Sunday's. The representative did not disclose the taxes and gratuity included which was $313!!!!! She advised me I got an email with the confirmation, which I just checked my email and did not get. She raised her voice multiple times and told me I could not prove that that was not discussed. I advised her that I would contact my bank about the difference and she said this conversation is over and hung up on me. I hope all conversations are recorded so that someone can go back and listen to it. I will post this review on Google, Yelp, Trip Avisor and any other avenue I can to warn people of this terrible business practice. Not discussing ALL fees is not ok. I will also contact the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint. I hope this helps someone else, if you book with them do it in person, get a receipt (which I did not get) and check your online banking or credit card statement."

                "description": "I called Majesty Tours about 2 weeks before a friend's birthday event, and they lady I spoke with on the phone was incredibly helpful. I quickly signed us all up for the \"ruby\" package (includes water and a snack, plus 3 vineyard stops).   Where the service started to stand out was when I had to call and change the reservation - TWICE. Not only were they completely understanding, they were also absolutely friendly and didn't bat an eyelash.   Fast forward to the day of our tour...  The Great: + Garrett, our driver. He was friendly, on time, helpful, knowledgeable, and was all about making sure we were having the best time possible. He was also very aware of the times, and managed our stops extremely well. He carried our items, provided the water and snacks on the van, and was simply great. + Our stops. Our group liked wines on the dry side so Majesty Tours made some suggestions based on our tastes. These were spot on and we loved out stops.  The OK: o The snacks on the bus was a plastic container filled with a sleeve of crackers, a sealed bag of cheddar cheese, and a sealed bag of pepperoni. The presentation could have been better, or maybe a little higher quality food would have been in order, but hey, it did the job.  Overall I was pleased with the tour and the service that Majesty Tours provided. I would recommend them if you are considering any time of tour in the hill country or need a driving service while in the area. Top notch!!"

What a surprise when he told us!  Didn't see that coming.  Three great tastings with good friends.  Discovered some very nice 2015 Texas wines.  The grapes have matured immensely since 2008 and glad to finally enjoy some good Texas wines.   Can't recommend this company any lower than *****!  Thank you Discovery Wine Tours for a memorable afternoon."

He called me a couple of days before to introduce himself and to confirm the pickup details. He also called me the day of and was on time. He made sure we were settled at each location and made it a great experience. Felt very safe - John wore a mask the whole time. Also, Kathie helped plan the itinerary. She's familiar with the wineries and distilleries in the area, and was very friendly. Couldn't recommend them more!"

                "description": "I was so impressed with this tour the first time we booked that I had to book it for another party! Well, this time it wasn't as impressive. I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

                "description": "Had a fantastic time visiting the Fredericksburg wine country with Valet for a Day. We had 6 adults, but our bus would have easily held double that (I didn't count the seats).  Rick was our main point of contact for inquiries, as well as our driver for the day. He was super easy to work with and helped us figure out what we really wanted to do. We had to get picked up from the Horseshoe Bay Resort (which is about an hour from Fredericksburg). So, we were able to visit two wineries (Becker and Bingham) and one distillery (Garrison Brothers). Garrison Brothers was the favorite by far and we ended up eating lunch there, too. Garrison also has tours starting at 10 while most wineries don't start until 11. Rick helped me work out a feasible schedule and then I had to book the tours themselves (which was more of a challenge than I thought because you're trying to coordinate specific times for specific places and one site will time out before you finalize, etc). So, by the time those were booked, we ended up having to alter our schedule and Rick was great about it. He showed up on time. The bus itself was fabulous. He had custom coffee orders ready for us, plus sodas and water onboard, as well as snacks (bags of chips, crackers, Snackens, etc). We were on time for every tour and never felt rushed. We were also back on time, which was important to me since we had to pick up our kids from the kids club. We paid a deposit up front and the balance a few days before our tour. Then, we paid tips in cash on the day of. I would absolutely recommend them and would use them again."

He and his wife renovated the bus, and it has an awesome, comfortable, yet trendy vibe. He had waters and cokes for us on the bus, and his wife made homemade cookies for my husband's birthday! And he took coffee orders to have ready for everyone after a fun day at the wineries! It was a very custom experience, and he made it easy and enjoyable. We will definitely be calling him when we come for our next trip!"

We ordered a beer flight. I love being able to try all the different beers on tap. There were two beers that were not available but she was able to replace those two with some seasonal beers. She did fail to mention that it was an up charge for the holiday beer but it was just a few dollars so we didn't fuss.   My wife and I split the ale burger. We got it on the jalapeño cheddar bun. It was VERY good. We we're presently surprised. We weren't too hungry, which is why we split the burger. It was still enough to fill us up. We also ordered an extra side of fries. We LOVED their fries. Didn't have to add salt or ketchup. They are great.   We really enjoy this place!"

It took her a little while to get to our table. When it was time to order our food, I was looking to get pizza. However, when asked what we'd like to order, she said there's no pizza. I had to quickly make a decision on something else. It would have been good to know when we were seated. We did ask to sit down in the benches, but they told us that it was only open on Saturdays and Sunday's and only apps were served (we went on a Sunday). When we received our food, my friends sandwiches and I were good, but my moms schnitzel was over cooked so we had to send it back . The second one came out fine and pretty quick though.  Overall it was fine, but I probably wouldn't go back."

Fredericksburg brewing looked like the most friendly.  I entered the inside. The servers escorted me to a table. I got beer. It was so good. I ordered a schnitzel. The schnitzel resembled Texas chicken steak. Probably, the chicken steak is some variant of schnitzel. Anyway, It was good.  The server asked me for one more beer. I ordered it. I was drunk. I was walking to my hotel. I found some street signs that said \" Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway\". The name was a hangover medicine to a Japanese guy. I became sober.LOL.  If you are looking for some German food, please check this restaurant."

They Offer a great Flight of 8 2oz beers....a little bit of everything. I mean if you order beer, you have to order a soft pretzel...its a must for us.....Sooooo Good!!....Main course....I went with the Wurst Sandwich Loaded with a Knackwurst, sauerkraut and fries on the side....Boy do I miss sauerkraut in my life, and the whole sandwich paired great with the Beerz...Wife had the Cheddar Ale Soup served in a bread bowl. Everything was just about perfect...including the service!!"

We came in 30 minutes prior to close but she didn't rush us at all and welcomed us to stay for a couple drinks. We saw the host guy trying to turn away a couple that came in for dinner and Gaelyn rushed over to welcome them in and she sat them at a table. The next night she was busy with the tables and kitchen; she seems to be a manager or owner, or a rare, hard worker.  The bartender the second night was also nice and helpful. We had the wings; they were different but good. Their beers were great and we'll definitely be back in on our next visit."

I must say, it's the most delicious Pretzel I have ever had!!! And, I've had many throughout my life. Oh so Fresh, warm, right out the oven.  Not hanging on a rotisserie all day.  Man, I can't wait to come back next time I visit. The beers were really good! I tried the beer ( El Jefe) and it was my favorite. The lager was good, and others. You can even try samplers if you are not sure.  But, I must say, our waitress gets 10 points out of 10. She deserves a raise. I recommend Bianca.  Friendly, attentive, and the best attitude.  Because of all of the above, I am coming back!"

Service was good, and the reuben, with fries, was satisfying.  I like the friendly, casual atmosphere.  I stayed on a Monday night, and I was the only one there, so it was very quiet.  I was in the Hill Country Lodge room, which faces Main Street.  The room was neat and clean, with cool themed decoration.  I'll definitely stay again to further explore the menu and try a safari-themed room."

I was disappointed there wasn't a more basic wiener schnitzel or spaetzle on the menu, those are German favorites.  The schnitzel and pretzel were good.  The sausage sample was great, all three were delicious.    I was so glad I got it to go, the COVID precautions were nonexistent, backed indoor dining and barely anyone with masks including bartenders and severs.  Thank goodness at least the hostesses were wearing masks, but I was uncomfortable being in the front door."

We've been to F'burg Brewing Company many times over the past 10+ years during our regular trips to F\"burg; probably hit FBC 2-3 times a year.  Nothing seems to have changed since our first visit in 2006.  Very good beers with a good variety of beers on draft from the inhouse brewery.  Never tried their wine or cocktails, after all it's BREWERY!!  Their menu has lots of options with a small focus on Germany food, but also offers pizza, sandwiches, salads, burgers and central texas offerings.  In Houston, we have VERY limited options for Germany food, so I always opt for the German entrees.  This visit I had the  Schinken Schnitzel, which is nothing but the German take on the Italian Milanesa right down to the thin slice of swiss cheese and ham.  The BIG difference was the sauce, which I had served \"on the side\". and glad I did, it really took away from the flavor of the Schnitzel.  Nice piece of pork cutlet, but the breading wasn't nice and crispy as most.  Ordered Red Cabbage and Onion Rings for my two sides, both were served lukewarm (as were my wife's Onion Rings), but we missed lunch during the day and were too hungry to send it back.  My wife had the Ale Burger, nice burger but nothing standout about it; thick patty done medium well with cheddar cheese and the \"salads\".    Good meal, but nothing really notable about it.  FBC was our second choice for the evening and they are a good \"backup plan\" or \"fallback\" if others restaurants have a wait."

We ordered and appetizer...Sausage that came with 3 Grilled Sausage a tiny pile of Sauerkraut a couple of types of mustards....tasty.  I ordered the German potato/onion soup.  It was a bowl of plane cream soup.  We ordered the hamburger that came Fries....nothing special,  Flavorless.  There fries were warm, dry thin....served in a small bowl.  The server recommended the bread pudding....again we were hoping for something awesome.  It was a slice of a loaf of bread pudding on a plate of Carmel....warmed but still cold in the middle. The dark beer and wine were good.  We lost our server mid service.... After we got our bar order....we witnessed the Bar tender picking his nose  and digging at something in his teeth.....we brought that to the shift managers attention.  Our meal was $68.00....not including tip. Kinda steep for A Burger, Soup, Appetizer, Beer , Wine  and desert mediocre quality."

                "description": "Such a large brewery! Beautiful grounds and the inside is just stunning! They have beautiful grounds and an outdoor garden to enjoy. They have the pouring station upstairs, but there is also a pouring bar downstairs with comfy seating, bar seating, and a large TV. Low lighting so definitely a cool mood downstairs vs upstairs. We stumbled into a part that looks like they host events like possibly weddings, which would be amazing! -- came here on a whim so they guys we were with could have some beer since they weren't much of wine drinkers. They had a good amount of beers to choose from and they offer flights, all of which were good that we had!   I wish I took more pictures because it was Like a castle!"

                "description": "Worth a visit if you are in Fredericksburg! They have a beautiful outdoor patio (one in back for drinks only and then another in front that connects to a full service restaurant). I'm not a beer drinker but decided to give it a try just for the views!   They have some good wines to choose from- don't be discouraged to visit here if you are not a beer drinker. Also, their restaurant has some cool options for German fare. Almost everyone in my family tried the chicken schnitzel which I would absolutely recommend.    I give 3 stars because they do not have full service (nor can you order off the food menu) in the rear patio. It's such a beautiful space- would definitely make the place more attractive if this change was made."

Recommend the chicken schnitzel/green beans/mashed potatoes. Comparable to the ones I've had In Europe. The customer service was amazing and the manager (Lara from LSU) was excellent. No issues at all. Will visit again soon!"

                "description": "This was our second visit and we really enjoyed a nice relaxing, mid-week lunch with a couple beers on the outdoor patio.    Our first visit was earlier last year on a holiday weekend and it was bit more stressful in terms of crowds and COVID concerns.  The staff all were all masked, but almost none of the patrons wore masks entering or inside the restaurant.    Recommend a week day visit instead of the busier weekends.   Beers were very tasty.  They have one of the better Pils in Central Texas and after living 20+ years in Germany, I think I am qualified to make this statement.   On the food side it's not German, but better described as pub grub.  Everyone was happy with their burger, spicy chicken sandwich, fish and chips, the Reuben and the Jäger Schnitzel made with chicken.    It wasn't gourmet, but it's a great place for a family gathering.   Oh, our server Karolina was excellent; she provided just the right amount of contact.    Ein Prosit!"

Only worth going if you want to try the German food, which was fantastic! The beer flight was nice, smooth like butter. Sandwich was huge, the roast beef was delicious. I really like the potato soup, simply but hearty. The chicken with  mashed potatoes was my favorite.  Reminds me of Switzerland"

                "description": "What a beautiful venue! We loved the scenery and the live music!  We had a larger party so I was excited they were able to accommodate all of us. The waitress was a hustler and for being short staffed she really did hustle. Thankfully they had food runners to help.  I ordered the potato soup and the sausage platter and we shared the meat and cheese charcuterie board.   The soup was perfect! It was warm and smooth and had a really great flavor!  The sausage platter came with three different types they were all good and it was a good complement to the soup. Honestly I could have shared both dishes and still been full it was a lot of food!  The charcuterie board was good, only tried a few pieces since I had so much food already... the goat cheese with the spiced pears was a great combo!  I tried just a bite of the spicy chicken sandwich... I thought it had a good flavor, but looked like pressed chicken.  My daughter got mac n cheese which she didn't care for.. I'm pretty sure they use a beer cheese which as a beer drinker I loved but she was not as big fan.   The flight of beer was definitely worth the price! I really enjoyed it.   My only true gripe was the chicken strips they brought my nephew- they were beyond burnt. I mean I was shocked when the waitress put them on the table.. my nephew ate a bite tried a second bite covered in ranch and was not going for it. I couldn't blame him. That was disappointing the cooks should never have platted them those belonged in the trash."

                "description": "I would recommend this place however, I do have some reservations about Altstadt.  In today's climate, I try not to negatively review a place for its slow service. That being said, the service was particularly slow. Our server was nice but it took far too long for a group of four who just got drinks and two appetizers.  I unfortunately will probably never come back again as I was visiting. But I would give it another try as the beer and appetizers were delicious.  I was just disappointed in the wait and hope they improve. Atmosphere was cool given the building and would recommend simply for the feel of it."

                "description": "Stopped in for a late 3pm lunch on a beautiful and busy Spring Saturday in April. Seated on the outside patio with no wait.  The Festbier was crisp and refreshing, but my second choice; the Schwarzbier (stout) is still my favorite here- it's smooth, creamy, with low bitterness (for a dark beer).  Their burger was fairly flavorful but a little overcooked. The added bacon was above average. A solid burger but probably not worth the $18 price tag (~3.5/5). Fries were thin and slightly crispy and warm.   For dessert I tried their homemade brownie with vanilla ice cream, raspberry jam, and chocolate syrup. Excellent! Needed a bigger scoop of ice cream though...  Great service. A solid 4.0/5 stars Uggg he still..."

The brewery has a taproom where they serve their house beers, most of which you can also get at Total Wine or Specs. Main building has the restaurant, while extensive, their menu was not that impressive and is overpriced. Due to COVID protocols, no more brewery tours. There's another overflow area called Tractor Museum if the main restaurant/building is at capacity where they serve the same beers, but no food. They are not pet friendly!"

This was our first time visiting the brewery and we didn't know we had to make reservations (woops!). The wait time was about an hour, but they have outdoor open seating where you can grab a beer and wait until your table is ready.   Pro tip: If you are waiting for your table. Don't buy beer at the bar by the entrance, which is super crowded. They have another bar by the music hall which was empty.   Once our table was ready we decided to sit outside and enjoy of the fall weather. I order the JÄGERSCHNITZEL and it was amazing! The dish comes with hunter sauce, mashed potatoes, braised red cabbage and seasonal vegetables. I would definitely come back to Altstadt just for their jagerschnitzel. Our waitress was amazing and she made we never ran out of beer or food.   Due to covid, they are not offering tour of the brewery. But if you visit don't forget to walk around their beautiful beer garden."

There is automatically a wedding vibe when you walk in. My fiancé ordered a flight which he enjoyed tasting and his dad enjoyed his drink too. There's a really classy but yet chill vibe as you relax and look out at the scenery. I still cannot get over how beautiful the architecture was though. Lovely atmosphere for drinking."

                "description": "This is an interesting place. I have to admit, when I first heard \"club with live music\" from my girlfriend, I expected something inside, loud, fancy etc. Instead, The Club at Barons CreekSide is an open, outdoors-y place that, at least on our visit, was being entertained by a solo keyboardist/singer doing standards and covers, and doing them pretty well! We arrived, unknowingly, close to kitchen closing, but our host (one of the owners, as it turns out), seated us at a nice table with an umbrella, and said we could feel free to order food if we did so soon.   The drink menu is basically beer and wine, but there are good selections of each. We settled into a glass of wine each and pondered food. I chose the Cajun gumbo, and my girlfriend asked for the sweet and salty panini. My gumbo was a surprisingly rich and delicious bowl, with a good dark roux and blackened chicken and sausage, with a generous portion of rice. It was very nice. The panini paired raspberry chipotle jam and Dijon mustard with ham and turkey to make a very delightful and complex flavor package, and the bread was properly toasted and pressed. Again, a nice dish.   It was a beautiful early fall evening, the lighting was modest and right, the crowd was light but very into the music, and it was just a wonderful time to spend outdoors with a glass of wine and some food. Personally, I'd like to see a more broad wine list and maybe some cocktails, but really, it's pretty darned good just the way it is. Definitely check out this off the beaten path place if you're in Fredericksburg!"

Walked in about 45 minutes before sunset and got comfortable outside with some tasty wine and good German beer for the boyfriend. The live music was just the right speed and volume for our little romantic getaway. We had the gumbo and lasagna both with a rather good and fresh Caesar salads.   We took our drinks and went up to the watertower in time to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Came back to some delicious peach cobbler a la mode and then listened to more live music. No one rushed us and the service was excellent from start to finish. Thank you, Daniel for an evening we will not soon forget."

Hailey was very attentive and we did not go without water, wine refills or anything we needed. This is definitely one of their strengths.   Heaters are available and servers are very responsive to your needs.   Live music is great. If you like Elvis, the band playing on Saturdays are for you.   We ordered the cheese platter and it was more than enough for two people. There's so many combinations that this paired with your wine will suffice.   The chicken panini was shared and it was ok. Chicken was a bit dry but the rest of the night made up for it.   We went with the Conundrum by Caymus and it's absolutely clean and crisp for a white wine.   Overall a great experience and would recommend."

The patio had a lot of decorative lighting and a small fireplace. The one man band played acoustic guitar and sang chill songs. The wine list by the glass was pretty large including red and white. I love Hill Country because appreciation of wine is apparent everywhere you travel. The server allowed me to taste one white before ordering a full glass and I appreciated the extra effort on her part. The two dinner entrees passed, but nothing stood out compared to our other Texas eats. I had a dinner portion Cobb Salad, typical ingredients and pretty fresh. My cousin ordered a taco trio and she was not jazzed by the rice and bean sides. The only thing that bothered the two of us was constant cigarette smoke. A table of four people near the corner of the building was chain smoking. Yea its outside but not the most desirable scent during a dinner experience!"

There are 7 of us - we just had dinner at Granite Lodge and we just wanted to grab more drinks from a local place! When we got out of the car the owner (unsure if she was the owner or manager) asked us if we had reservations. We did NOT, but she said she could seat us at a table outside. Totally great, we were excited! Before we sat down, she said VERBATIM: \"we will seat you only if you won't split checks and only if you're nice to our staff. We don't want anyone drunk here\". This lady insinuated that our money wasn't good enough and that we were going to be rude to her staff. We didn't even bat an eye and we left. The profiling that this lady did for her potential customers from Dallas was absolutely ridiculous. I will tell every single person about this experience. You'd think with such a hard year with COVID-19 this place would entertain customers willing to spend a hefty amount of money here! Guess not! All good though, enough being a horrible establishment"

The menu is small but don't let that deter you, this place is definitely worth the stop if you like jazz/blues, a casual but romantic atmosphere, reasonably priced wine, and friendly service. Shrimp tacos were added to the menu, which were pretty good. The salad was tasty -- added shrimp to it. They had blankets on the backs of chairs in case it got cold outside."

                "description": "When Marjan and I visit Fredericksburg, this is one of our usual haunts.  Sitting on Main, this is fashioned as a restaurant known for its \"everyman\" German food.  Nothing fancy here, casual environs, plenty of seating left and right of entry, with a large seating area in the rear, festooned with Germanic flags, flags of sporting teams, picnic table type seating in that area.  Immediately left of the entry is a bar seating perhaps 15 or so patrons.  The queue can be lengthy on any given day, witness the popularity of the establishment.      First a disclaimer.  Traditional German food of this style can be heavy, fried, sometimes greasy, but if this is your wont, go for it!  There are no salady, delicate dishes here.  But given that, properly prepared, the offerings can be quite tasty.  So, here are our thoughts.      First item.  When you visit Auslander, DO NOT ask for a table.  Request a seat at the bar!  Why, the dear reader may ask?  The wait will be much shorter, but most importantly, one gets to sit at the best seat in the house.  Face to face with engaging, entertaining bartenders, TV screens fore and aft, and sitting elbow to elbow with locals that are more than willing to share local wisdom...and erstwhile philosophy...at the drop of a hat!        Second, the bartenders will send your food order directly to the kitchen, shortening by a significant margin, your wait for their menu items.        Third, watching over the bar area, is Bevo, a beloved icon for us, parents of UT Austin grads!  Now that is what we call atmosphere!!  LOL!!!      Of the foodstuffs.  We have enjoyed their sausage sampler and their Reuben sandwich, sided with sauerkraut and potato salad in the former, and fries in the latter.  We considered these offerings very satisfying.  Marjan particularly enjoyed the Reuben!  But friends, nothing is a better companion to German foods than BEER!!  Our choice is always Chimay....Chimay Grande Reserve Blue!        There are iconic establishments in Fredericksburg.  We think Auslander makes the short list!  Drop in for a brew and a sausage!  We think you will enjoy...and sit at the bar!!   Be well!!"

It was very large portion and definitely got a lot of volume for my dollar, but the chicken was slightly dry and not flavorful, even with the gravy. The mashed potatoes and sauerkraut were solid sides but nothing remarkable. The bread is sweet and delicious.  My friend had the jagerschnitzel and said it was okay but lacked flavor.  The service was fantastic and the server was very attentive. We were seated quickly and the food came out fast."

We started with fried pickles and ranch. Portion was huge and ranch was delicious. They were well seasoned and very crispy.  I got the Jagerschnitzel with mashed potatoes and buttered corn. The schnitzel was crispy and covered in wine gravy and mushrooms. Flavor was savory and portion was large. Sides were ok, nothing to rave about but the meal was filling. My friend got the chickenschnitzel, which is topped with gravy. Also crispy and savory.   Good service, decent food, large portions."

We put our name down on the waitlist and were told we'd have 10 minutes from the time we were texted to get our table. Since the estimated wait time was 45-60 mins, we decided to check out a few shops in the area. Once we received our text, it took us approx. 4 minutes to get back to the restaurant, only to find out that our table was given away due to us arriving past the 10 minute window. I completely understand that it was busy and they want to get people in/out as quickly as possible, but I did not appreciate the hostess lying to us about arriving 10 mins after they texted us. We could clearly see that we received the text 4 mins ago, so why not come up with a better reason for giving our table away?  Anyways, we were eventually seated and I ordered the Käsewurst. I was not a fan of the hot German potato salad or red cabbage, but the sausage was incredible! I was surprised by how large it was and it certainly filled me up!"

It had traditional German decorations and a Biergarten in the back.   Kudos to them for being open on a Tuesday! We were on an off day in Fredericksburg and a lot of places were closed. It is a little touristy, but most of Fredericksburg is.   The Kasewurst was spicy and had cheese in it. It was also cooked just right and came with sauerkraut and your choice of side (I had potato salad, pictured below).   Overall, got what I expected which was decent, casual German food at a cheap price. I would stop by again but am curious to try other similar german food in the area."

I've never eaten a meal I could describe as absolutely mediocre. Not a single dish was bad but not a single dish could be describe as good either. I had the German snack appetizer, jaegersnitzel, the German meat balls, the Rueben, and the chicken fried chicken. And my kids got chicken strips and fries. And even the fries tasted of mediocrity. As of they were defrosted and re frozen and then fried. They tasted stale. The Rueben had the cheapest sandwich meat I've ever seen almost like tofu meat vegans eat. The German snack appetizer tasted like cheap sausage that was over boiled and then served with burger toppings . The snitzel had no seasoning and the gravy was bland. The German potato salad was just boiled potatoes. The meatballs looked like they were once frozen. I feel this place once was great or the location is just that amazing but if I lived here I would never eat here again. It's like someone opened a restaurant with the concept of making every dish taste like a microwave dinner."

While we had to wait about 20 minutes, but we were here on a Saturday, so we expected to wait. Definitely try the Kielbasa. I had the one that had jalapeños and pepper Jack cheese. This was incredible. However, what would've gotten this restaurant 5 stars, would be if they made the portions bigger (instead of one link, make it 2). One just wasn't enough. The wait staff was prompt and attentive. Our overall experience was great. I recommend this place."

Packed with flavor, Rouladen is thinly sliced or pounded beef covered in German mustard, bacon, onions and pickles, then rolled up and simmered in a rich brown gravy. If you've never had it, you must try it. You can thank me later. Here, they serve it over spaetzel, making for a hearty and very tasty dish.  Auslander has been around for many years, and is a true Fredericksburg stalwart. Pay them a visit when you come to town. And order the Rouladen."

                "description": "Weekend road trip to Fredericksburg and some German food is definitely in order, right? Stopped at the Auslander on a last minute whim. Seated us (2) right away and our server was a doll. Checked on us and always made sure we had water. Food came out pretty quickly too.  We ordered the fried mushrooms as an appetizer. Lots of greasy breading and served with ranch, which was interesting. I ate about 3 and decided I was beginning to feel gross. BF ended up removing the breading and just eating the mushrooms.   For entrees, I ordered the Jägerschnitzel and BF ordered the käswurst. My jägerschnitzel was cooked well and had a nice crunch, but the gravy tasted like a cheap powder package brown gravy from the store, not the red wine gravy I was promised. The mushrooms also tasted canned. The cabbage and mashed potatoes were good though and the dinner roll was sweet and pillowy. BF said the sausage tasted like the ones you get from the gas station, so all around not too impressed.   After leaving, the food kind of dropped in our stomachs like a ton of bricks. We definitely had to walk around for a minute. We probably won't be back, but not sure if it's the restaurant or maybe this type of food just isn't for us."

They have a great selection of draft beer in the traditional German mugs, and I do recommend the sausage plate as an appetizer (choose the spicy version) - nice sausage, fresh dark bread and excellent sauerkraut. We probably would have stayed for another draft beer (there were three couples) but getting the strong vibe they wanted to turn the table we ended up going across the street for another cold one and more appetizers."

The atmosphere is real cute and refreshing since we were able to eat outside.   My fiancé and his dad really enjoyed the beer there. The glasses are so cute! I was also intrigued by the red cabbage since so many Yelpers seem to enjoy it so I ordered that as my side. I personally thought it was a bit too sour for me, but my fiancé loved it. It's definitely packed with flavor though.   I also ordered the spätzle which I have heard mixed reviews about, but I personally enjoyed it. If we ever return, I'm interested in trying the bratwurst."

I got the pork schnitzel and it was tasty and improved with his mustard.  It was crunchy and flavorful and the mashed potatoes and green beans hit the spot. Music was county and sometimes pop. Good selection of beer on top. The frozen sangria was a little tart for my taste.  Overall, good experience and recommended with reasonable pricing."

                "description": "This place on the main drag offers a great beer menu, including several classic German beers on tap, and offers a pleasant place to hang out. Outdoor patio is apparently heated in cold weather, although we decided not to brave it.   Food and service were just OK.  I got the German meatballs with spaetzle. Generously sized meatballs sit atop a pile of spaetzle that I thought were a little too soft. No kraut or veggie comes with this plate, which was pretty bland. My companion got the potato soup, which was really thin with no chunks of potatoes.  Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, we didn't see our server for long stretches, and once had to flag down a different server to get something.   We'll give this place another try, as the German sausage plates sounded good. If you're just looking for German beer and snacks, there's a bar area that's probably just right for you."

                "description": "Wow! I really want to be \"nice\" and give this location 5 stars but what brought me to this place was the 5 star reviews on Yelp. I wish someone had just been more honest.  What I'd give 5 stars is the owners explanation and story about how he started his wine and bought the buildings in the small town that inspired him to start this vineyard. He truly loves it and that was conveyed to us.  However, the rest of the experience was def not 5 stars. We did 2 flights of the wine and 2 glasses of the Sangria. 3 of us drank and one of us just requested a Sprite or Coke. (Thank you to our designated driver.) We received our wine and sangria within about 10-15 mins but after 20-30 mins I had to get up and ask for the sprite. The server came over w a can of H‑E‑B twist and asked if this is what we wanted. Umm... we were fine w anything. He just requested a drink without alcohol but she left to ask the owner if that was what she was supposed to give our friend. ‍ He finally got his drink. Yay.  Ok... on to the wine flight. The way it was served was kind of unique. You get one wine glass w 4 very small mason jars of wine. (Definitely a taste)  You get one dry white and 3 dry reds. I like dry wine but these wines just tasted watered down. That's the only way I can describe them. The white tasted sour/bitter. We had been at Vintners Hideaway earlier and the wine tasting was an entirely different experience. We tasted 6 different glasses of wine and were given information on how to best smell, aerate and experience the wine. We were told about the flavors and what wines went best w different foods. It was a fun and interactive experience. Here, we got our tray w our wine samples and one glass and were told what order to drink them in. The end.  I'd give the wine tasting experience 1 star.  Now, the courtyard area is lovely. It's open and there are plenty of tables and chairs. There are 2 fire pits and there is a one room cellar you can walk down into w one table. We liked the ambiance. Maybe that is what everyone loves about this place?"

The service here was excellent (the owners are very hospitable). The atmosphere outside was quaint. I noticed the establishment had a small wine cellar with a table and chair set up. It reminded me of the one we had when I was a child. The nostalgia of that aspect alone made coming here a great experience for me.  My guest had the Sangria which was nicely done. I had the glass of white and was not impressed with the body of the wine.  In general, this was a neat little spot to stop in and enjoy the moment.  #supportlocal #supportveteranowned"

I would definitely recommend it here, it's a little bit further down from the main shops so wasn't as crazy. We were able to get a table in the shade which was very nice.   I would totally recommend getting the picnic basket to snack on. There were four of us and it seemed enough for a little something. The pimento was very good as was the cookie.   They had water sitting outside with glasses which is always appreciated when it's hot and you're drinking.   I would say they had a decent wine selection. Most of the group got the sangria and really liked it!"

We were immediately greeted by Frances, which we had no idea was one of the owners until towards the end of our visit. She was absolutely the sweetest with the most bubbly personality!  She told us a bit about the history of the vineyard while we enjoyed a glass of her delicious Sangria! It was so delicious and refreshing that I could not leave without taking a bottle. I regret not grabbing two more to bring back home but will definitely be stopping by again on our next visit to Fredericksburg!"

The outdoor seating is great and you don't really realize you're off of main street.  I loved the Sangria and the Tempranillo.  There's only a few people taking care of the tables, so the service is a little slower but they are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  It was cold the day we were there and they had a couple fires going.  The pimento cheese in the picnic basket was really, really good.  You can even take one of the picnic baskets to go. I highly recommend a stop here when you need a break from shopping.  There are picnic tables so you're good if you have more than 4 people."

Don't turn your nose up at their \"All Texas Wines\" because everything they make is so good. Smoothing Iron Mountain is real easy to drink even on a blistering afternoon. Nice Albariño is hard to find in a lot of places so we stocked up on their 2020."

                "description": "My family and I came here on vacay in pursuit of some ~authentic~ German food. Since I've never had German food before, I have no clue what that means, but we did leave full and satisfied.  All of us pretty much ordered one of two Schnitzel dishes, virtually identical besides the accompanying sauce. We also got the German Sausage Plate to share, which was probably the tastiest and most interesting of the dishes. As a big fan of pickled vegetables, I did enjoy the side of Sauerkraut, but even that wasn't enough to cut the heaviness of the Schnitzel. In conclusion, not somewhere I would routinely visit, but it does have that comfort junk food appeal (with a German twist)."

                "description": "There's a lot of places to eat in Fredericksburg, tourism is their business but none beat Silver Creek's ambiance and setting.  Right on Main Street, they feature an outdoor dining area shaded by a magnificent tree.  Our lunch was accompanied by live music that was just the right volume.  And the food?   Well that's outstanding as well.  We started with warm German pretzel rolls and added a queso dip.  They disappeared quickly.  Our table had entrees ranging from a salad to fish and chips to brats and a Reuben.  All were good and featured authentic German sides. A lovely lunch."

My bratwurst sandwich topped with saurkraut really hit the spot. I chose a side of German potato salad which did not disappoint. Accompanied by a cold Spatzel Lager, I was a happy camper.  My wife ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The burger was more than she could eat, and quite tasty.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Food was quite tasty. Atmosphere was fun. And they're dog friendly. How cool is that?"

It's, also, a great place to go if half your party wants German (Schnitzel, etc.) but the other half wants something else (Steak, Salmon, etc.)."

We ordered bread pudding for dessert. The bread pudding wasn't my favorite, but it didn't taste bad. Just a FYI, the bread pudding  has nuts in it."

The fish was cooked to within an inch of its life. Fish is supposed to be flakey  and batter is supposed to be crispy. The batter was as hard as nails, way beyond crispy, and the fish wouldn't flake, even when attacked with a knife and fork!!   I'm English, been eating fish and chips all my life, it's our national dish. If there's one thing I know about it's fish and chips - and this was bldy awful. Only positive was they had malt vinegar!"

Slowwwww  service but a decent patio vibe with some nice CandW music playing.   Our Loaded Brisket Fries had good flavor but were served lukewarm and were far from \"Texas sized.\" We were wanting a decent steak, but their 12oz Ribeye was average tasting but above average priced. The best part of the steak meal was their heavenly, creamy mashed potatoes. Wanted to like this place more...."

He told us our party of 2 wouldn't be too long of wait for patio seating.  But patrons were not leaving and enjoying music after their dinner. For a long time. Okay. No biggie and out of the restaurants control. We actually saw some People sitting for several hours, as we had walked by the place earlier in the day.  About 30 minutes for a table we were seated.  We sat at a dirty table for more than 15 minutes. The dishes had been removed but it had not been wiped down. Not Good during this pandemic.  We waited and waited and waited. No server ever came by. At all.  So we left.  Very disappointing service.  I don't think we've ever left a restaurant like this.  Very disappointing and a waste of time.  Skip this place."

There was a table of 11 of us and one of my friends didn't get her food until all the rest of us had started eating. The wait staff stated they were out of a necessary ingredient for her food and apologized for the delay. However, she ordered a second drink and they never brought that out either. We were all charged 20% gratuity and the manager was very confrontational with my friend. We will NEVER come back here and recommend that you don't either as long as this establishment treats their customers this way.  I asked for a manager and the server stated he was the manger.

                "description": "Good place to get dinner in downtown Fredericksburg, and open longer than many restaurants. Outdoor dining area is pleasant even when hot, and the live music is nice.  The food is decent but not spectacular. Burgers are pretty good. First time I came, I ordered the green chile enchiladas but they come in a bowl and it's almost like eating soup... not what I expected!  Others have mentioned it but it's still worth noting that they basically have counter service now. That's hardly a problem, BUT it's easy to get confused because they'll seat you like you're in a full-service restaurant and not say a word about ordering at the bar. Then, even at the bar you can barely see the whole area by the kitchen with the drinks and other stuff.  I imagine we'll be back to Hondo's, but considering Fredericksburg is a major tourist town, it's not reasonable to expect visitors to sort all that out the first time without some ruffled feathers. But it all works out in the end."

We went on a cold night but definitely wished it would have been warmer to sit outside because that area looks cool.   We wanted to like this place more but the set up is what threw us off the most. You wait in line to put your name on a waitlist to sit. Then you get seated only to get up and wait in line to order at the bar. Only other negative thing I would say was service, we definitely got treated like we weren't locals. My husband asked if they had draft beer and the bartender was most definitely offended by the question, then did the \"tapping the finger\" thing while he looked at the bottled beer choices. oh But a guy and his wife walked up both bartenders demeanor changed. Happy, friendly, got drinks right away for them. Also...just threw us off."

My husband sat on the patio with our dog while I went inside to order. This place is set up like a Panera, where you order your food then go pick it up from the kitchen when your buzzer goes off. The line to order was super long, but expected in a tourist district on a busy weekend.   The chicken sandwich was huge and juicy but was a little bland. The smoked turkey on a croissant was dry. My husband did enjoy his poblano chicken sandwich.   Overall, good atmosphere, really nice patio space, and so-so food."

                "description": "TLDR: Decent, not spectacular food and service.  Seating/ordering is very strange. You check in, and you're shunted off to a back porch to be called up and seated. Then you have to order food and drinks at the bar, and pick up the food at a window when called. Not bad, but seems overly complex especially for the drop-in tourist.  The food's fine, but nothing to write home about. Decent hamburger, decent nachos, and decent chicken-fried steak. Kudos for a flavorful gravy and some cool Western decor, but that's about it. This place will work in a pinch for a group, but there are other options out there if you have the time and inclination.  This place scores a 3 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK having a nosh here with Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

                "description": "After watching Elder Eats and finally making a trip to a Fredericksburg we were happy to check out Hondo. The enchiladas were so tasty. They were gooey, tasty, and topped with big chunks of fajita steak. I did not originally think 5oz was going to be sufficient was I was gladly mistaken. My husband loved the Ruben, eating it so fast I never got a bite to taste. We also shared the trio of fries, chips, and onion straws. Each of the sauces served with appetizer were very good and I'm not normally a save person. We had to wait about 30 minutes, but didn't feel that was terrible given the time of day on a weekend we visited. The only tip would be to have the host explain the process when you check in, I was a little confused on ordering and had to ask around. We figured it out quickly, but would be helpful to other first timers."

                "description": "A group of 11 of us visited this place off of a recommendation. It was pouring down rain on 5/22/21 and we were soaking wet as we entered the patio. So my review is based ONLY on the lack of customer service we experienced because we didn't even make to tables to eat.   The hostess had a very nasty attitude towards my party of 11. We all felt she had a very condescending tone in her voice. Upon entering out of the rain I asked how do we order and if we can. And her very nasty response led us to believe she did not want our business.   We found the bar with two men who again felt the need for some reason to just get us out and not care to share their menu so we just frantically found the simplest drink to order. I made it easy too ... paid for my party on one tab instead of having them ring up each drink and pay individually. Yes the margaritas were good and worth the $8 but geeze this place was brutal and honestly prejudiced towards us.   To the owners - please know that you have these types of people treating innocent customers upon entering the building this way. It's definitely a turn off and will hurt your business reputation."

The BBQ Burger was better and we liked the onion strings. There wasn't anything special honestly about the Mahi Mahi Burger. Also one star down for the fries, as they didn't seem fresh and were cold.  We did enjoy the outdoor seating, however, and the staff was friendly."

The live music from Billie Jo lured us in as we walked by. We only wanted drinks so the hostess directed us to the outdoor bar. Service is fast and the bartender makes a proper stiff drink! I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of 6 drinks (~ $40!).   It's casual and easy and great.   Since it was around 8:30 p.m., we couldn't sit at a table yet since they were still serving food. But after 9 p.m., we were able to take over a table.   If you're looking for a great place to round out your night, this is it!"

                "description": "Great spot in Fredericksburg's Main Street for good food and live music. The vibe here is super casual and fun, even during Covid-19. Modest pricing.  My fiancé and I walked in and got lucky... we got seated at the best table in the house! Directly from the stage and tucked away under trees with sparkling string lights. Live music started at 7pm and definitely set the mood.  We had a lovely, down-to-earth server that told us all the specials. We ended up starting off with the Stuffed and Roasted Jalapeños... sooo good. Creamy, cheesy. Wrapped with bacon. And the heat definitely kicks in when you're eating it. German beers. And then followed with the off-the-menu special Brisket Mac and Cheese with Cilantro and the Green Chili and Pulled Pork Quesadilla. Both also pretty good. Classic home dishes with a twist.. and full of flavor. Meat was well-seasoned and well-cooked, not dry. We ended the night with tequila shots! Our server was cheering us on :)  We recommend this place if you're coming through Fredericksburg and are feelin' a cool, casual vibe with live music. Not all of the tables are great, although the outdoor/patio seating is definitely a better choice than indoor (indoor seemed cramp and stuffy)! Good food and not pricey like their neighboring restaurants. Keep it up Hondo's!"

They typically have live music every night, but be sure to check their schedule on the website. Sit outside for the best atmosphere! They don't take reservations and the wait is typically long, so be prepared for that. During peak times, the wait can be 1-2 hours. If you go for lunch, it will be much easier to get in. Right now, they don't have servers, so you just go up and order your food and drinks at the bar. I think it works well and the food comes out in a timely manner. The drinks are amazing (and strong). The food is good and they have mostly bar food. I love the green chile enchiladas!!"

There are several other wineries nearby that have better wines, however, Fat Ass definitely has a unique brand that's worth checking out.   They have a tasting where you get to keep your glasses as souvenirs. Depending on the day, they change the theme of the wines included. When I visited, the theme was sweet wines. Nothing super exciting but I did enjoy the peach variety."

If I was rating just based on customer service, they would have 5 stars. However, the wine is the main attraction. It is a cute spot to watch live music and hang with friends. If you are not a sweet wine drinker (and my sweet, I mean SWEET) then I don't recommend this place. They are catering to a certain clientele. The wines are very syrupy in my opinion. However, if you want good photo ops..stop in! They are also apart of the 290 bus tour. I would suggest to try it at least once to see if you like it."

Dale is amazing, I wanna say customer service, but we weren't really treated like customers, just like some normal best friends, and our friend Dale has wines!! He explained all the wines, to a \"T\". We are not \"wine people\" I like sweet wines because I'm just not   a wine person.....but these wines, OMG! Hands down we will be back. Love love love it! Days to come he said are Friday, Saturday and even Sunday....looking forward to the next time.  We did the wine tasting for $10 and got a free souvenir cup. Bought two bottles...I could've bought every one I tasted...I loved them all, so weird for me bc like I said we aren't wine people."

It's a bit rowdier than most of the other wineries you'll find in Fredericksburg, but it's a good place to go to nonetheless. If you're looking for something that works fast, I would definitely recommend the can of Whuup-Ass as it has a 12.5 ABV! Their frozen sangria is also a great choice, especially for those lovely hot summer days. They also have some funkier flavored wines such as chocolate, watermelon, and prickly pear jalapeño that are super fun to try. Even if you're not in to sweet wines, this is somewhere you just have to go and experience."

My favorite part was, by far, the donkey on site. His name is Frito and he's perfect.  The wine was, well, bad. We did the tasting and my husband found one that was tolerable and inquired about buying it more as a courtesy but it was $28 - way overpriced for the quality. We'll easily drop $50 on a good bottle but this one was worth no more than $12.  If you're a wine snob, stay far away. If you're looking to kick back and have some fun, Fat Ass is a good choice."

There was another young lady that was very busy running back and forth who took the time to acknowledge us and manage to get someone to take care of us. If this is the type of busy that you all are going to run I will be sure to spread the word of what to expect. Because its no secret that bc of the pandemic more and more black ppl are started to explore things to do in Texas. An if yall are in the business of missing out on money then so be it.

As \"wine country\" you'd expect it to be a blood of Christ kind of place with fine Christian™ folk.  But I'll tell you the devil must have poisoned the grapes and took possession of my insides. I have never expelled so many demons before.

When we brought it to the servers attention it was just \"oh, well, guess we will throw that one away\" without any acknowledgement. I feel like this was an opportunity to check all of the salt and pepper shakers that was missed. I hope the other guest present did not have the same experience.   If your choose to eat here: check the pepper before you put it on your pizza."

We waited for close to 40 minutes and only half of our group got food. While waiting, no one even stopped by to refill waters or offer more drinks. The waiter never came to ask the guests who were sitting on the end of the table who didn't receive food if they were ok. When the manager came out to speak with us she was unapologetic. I ended up leaving without them even bringing food out. Will not be back."

Our waiter seemed like he spent a little too much time at the CBD shop prior to coming to work that day. Had to ask for straws, utensils, etc. Slow as molasses.   Kids grilled cheese was so dry it should have been a crouton, cheese was cold by the time we got it so the whole sandwich was stuck together completely and lopsided. My two year old wouldn't eat it (says a lot)  My daughter ordered chili - just chili, with no sour cream or pico, and shredded cheese on the side. She got a frito pie (if that's what you'd call it) with barely ANY chili on it, had to ask for more, and queso. Everyone loves queso - but we asked for chili with shredded cheese. When I asked waiter he shrugged and said \"that's what I typed in so I guess that's what the chili is\" ???? Really?   Husband ordered supreme pizza, all toppings were basically in the very middle of the pizza. Half of crust was wasted because the toppings weren't spread out. Tasted fine.  I got the fiesta salad. Waiter forgot my dressing, by the time I finally got it I had eaten the chicken out of it. Some of the spinach was already wilted/old. My chicken didn't taste like a fiesta dish, really didn't have much flavoring. Not much more to comment on that.   The only thing that saved the experience was the dip. The chips suck but the dip is good, so if you go, at least get that. We won't be back."

The soups are made from scratch and the spicy pizza (do not recall the name) but it had diced peperoncini was quite tasty.  The first time we were there on a Saturday night and it was quite packed, nevertheless food came out in relatively quick order.   In a tourist Mecca like this especially on a weekend things can be quite hit or miss, but Sozial Haus delivered."

I ordered a dry rose (hair of the dog and all that), and the pickle soup. After I had my lunch there, I was probably 75% better. I think this soup has healing properties. It's like a potato soup with carrots and add pickles. It's different and so good. Ryan got the chicken salad sandwich. They add avocado and pesto to the sandwich and it's such a treat. Their main thing is pizza which looked delicious, next time i will give it a shot, I just needed a soup today."

She insisted on not taking our food order even though we had been waiting 20 minutes already looking at the menu. When she returned in 10 more minutes, she went out of her way to sneak up on the dog from behind, which really set him off.

The laid back atmosphere is great until you don't get service or the service is so chaotic all you can do is laugh.   The restaurant is seat yourself so we went to the patio area- we watched two other tables show up on the patio and get waited on before our table of 4 did. We waited over 15 minutes to get menus- we tried ordering two appetizers- which again took forever. It started to pour down rain so we came inside to a table right by the door- so our 3rd (yes 3rd!) server looked at our table then walked by and started panicking on the patio thinking we walked out ‍  We wave at him through the window and he realizes we are inside. So he takes our order and my friend orders a beer. We watch servers wandering around, running to the wrong tables, fighting with each other, watched a female server drop a credit card and just stare at it for a good 30 seconds before slowly bending down to pick it up. Our server starts wondering around from table to table asking if they ordered the beer finally my friend waves him over to tell him it's hers.   The appetizers arrive- queso and jalapeño popper dip- both tasted great! When our pizzas arrive they are ok and kind of bland. When it's time to leave he says so we don't do individual checks only a split check equally- which we didn't mind but it would've been nice to see that on the menu or told beforehand.. we asked for a to go box 6 times before finally giving up and just paying for the food and leaving.   In the future I'd just skip it and try somewhere else where the staff actually wants customers."

She also got some little corn muffins that were delicious. My sis and I shared the Reuben sandwich and pasta salad and both were very good. We brought home a yummy dessert to share. The service was good. The restaurant has a simple interior. We sat by a window. There were a lot of dead flies on the windowsill-hence the 4 star review. Dead flies seriously affect the ambiance of a place!"

It was seat yourself, so we choose a table in the backroom and then we waited, and waited and waited some more.  MIL finally got up and asked for service and then we waited and waited and waited some more.  Meanwhile SIL found a used paper menu on a nearby chair so we perused it while we waited and waited some more.  (If it were just me and the hubby, we would've left by now).  Finally, a waitress without wearing her mask properly comes over and asked if we were ready to order.  Umm...yeah, thanks to the lonely, dirty menu we had found.  We ordered 2 Turkey BLT's and a gyro, neither of which is worth writing about, wait, I take it back the bread was pretty darn tasty and fresh, wish the turkey would've been evenly distributed on it, but it wasn't.  The chips were bland and almost stale.   Yeah, we won't be coming back here for sure, even when COVID is over."

I think our server may have been a little 'elevated' as he forgot multiple parts of our order more than once. They also don't seem to have any table assignments for the staff so no one ever knows who has been taken care of.

Our waiter (I'm sorry, I forget his name) was wonderful and friendly. We had a tough time deciding on what to order- many choices and they all sounded good at the time because I was hungry for anything. Ended up going with their spinach salad which was very tasty, after loading up on chips and queso at first. I also ordered the frozen peach bellini TWICE since that was so yummy and refreshing in the sun. Their pizza looked good and apparently they're known for it but we just weren't in the mood for pizza.

                "description": "Worst experience in memory. We were seated for more than 15 minutes before I got up to get menus, as none of the employees had checked on us. The employee by the table with the paper menus said there were menus on the table. I told him there weren't. He said they were. I told him there weren't. iTools the menus back to the table and he came by to say he'd notify our waiter and pointed to the QR code on the table saying that was the menu.  The word menu wasn't on it at all.  We thought it led to their social media.    No one came to take our order. 5-10 minutes later he stopped to ask if anyone had come by. Nope.  We ordered 2 sandwiches. It took more than 20-30 minutes for them to arrive. I had the chicken artichoke melt, which was pretty good, but the chicken was dry. I added sugar to my tea, but alas, I didn't have any silverware to stir it in. The table next to us ordered after us, and was served a good 10 minutes before us.    Some staff were wearing masks, some weren't. Some were wearing them covering their mouth only. I'll attach the photo of the sign posted about wearing masks. Basically: whatever reason you have for not wearing one is good enough for us, and we'll cite laws that don't apply to explain why we aren't going to enforce mask mandates to protect our customers.    I'll never go back again."

I know because I was there for 10 minutes waiting just outside the crowded bar seeing through the pane windows. In fact, one guy, Patrick walked within 1 foot of me with his buff around his neck. These actions tells patrons you don't care about their health.  I cannot see how this is acceptable when ya'll are essential workers handling food with responsiblility for the health of both patrons and staff during the height of the pandemic in a super busy tourist town.  Please coach them to do better, and we might return. Be safe in 2021.  Lee Mc"

They had no Spätzle instead offering cold egg noodles that spent too long under a heating lamp, making them dry and hard (and given the temperature of the noodles  the heating, the lamp might have needed the coils checked and replaced; it was obviously not working properly). Fortunately the gravy left a very bad taste so it helped cover the taste of the rest of the meal. The service was just ok. Our waitress stopped once to see if we were ok.  I would strongly recommend against dining here. Das Abendessen was ganz schrecklich!!'"

We ordered the schnitzel and it was ok breading felt somewhat soggy and the corn was slapped on the try like when it's cafeteria food line. Beers were ok also. It was convenient as it was open on a Sunday for late lunch hence our reason to go there but would not return on a repeat visit to Fredericksburg. Server was very nice though hence the 3 stars."

Although German food is not my favorite, I've eaten it all my life and even been to Germany, so I've had some pretty amazing experiences.  This was not one of them.  Good portions, food was hot and good atmosphere, and place was packed. Still I didn't really like anything we had and would not go back."

                "description": "When one is in Fredericksburg, one must have German foods! So we ended up here because the wait was bearable and they were able to seat our somewhat large party. This restaurant is quaint and adorable, complete with laminated checkered tablecloths and a bud vase with fresh flowers.   Our server was great and took care of us, giving helpful suggestions. While the menu seemed overwhelming at first, with so many unfamiliar terms, it really boiled down to variations of sausage/bratwurst, schnitzel, and sides.  Complimentary marbled rye bread was a much appreciated gesture. (I was starving).  I ended up getting bratwurst plate, which came with sides of potato salad and sauerkraut. The potato salad was more like a sweet potato-salad-flavored mashed potato. Great balance to the salty bratwurst that I also ate with more bread.  Altogether, it's a little pricey but a fun experience."

                "description": "I had very high hopes and expectations for this place after 2 prior local German venue dining experiences that rocked my foodie world. I heard this was a very popular place as well and in fact the oldest German restaurant in the county. Perhaps I let hype get out ahead of me but nonetheless.   The place is smaller inside but nice and quite, mellow, relaxed. The staff are kind and friendly. The service is fast and accurate. The menu has all the traditional German fair dishes you could ask for. I went with the Kasseler Rippchen plate expecting a normal thick pork chop with my plate. Instead I got 2 small thin pieces of hamsteak I'd expect for a breakfast dish. They were good yet no doubt! As was the picked red cabbage and saurkraut sides. All good! Just danty on the meat portion which never happens with German dishes I've had. Big portions is part of what makes the plates so unique is it not?   I simply felt I paid a dinner price for a breakfast entree is all. Beyond that, it's a good place to go and perhaps the other dishes are a better testament to what they really offer here.  I'd likely go to one of the other 2 spots I'd been to before if German fare was my dinner intent."

The restaurant was kinda cute but the cutlery was dull and the cups and plates were made of plastic despite the food being over 20 dollars. The food I had, the paprika schnitzel, was very bland tasting and wasn't very good. The schnitzel it's self was chewy and dusty. The potatoes were VERY sweet and no one I went with liked it.               Unlike me, my party did like most of the food, so take my opinion of the food with a grain of salt. Over all, I was unimpressed by the grandma-esc decor and bland food. Especially for the amount that it cost."

                "description": "As mentioned by many, this is a cute restaurant in the heart of Main Street. Only a few tables were taken when we entered so we decided to try it out due to COVID capacity concerns (50% for inside sitting). We ordered the schnitzel and the bratwurst plates (photos attached).  Our food got to our table fairly quickly. The troubling part about this is that the restaurant started filling up just as quickly. Every single table (except for one by the door) was taken by the time we started eating our meals. I was disappointed given the 50% ordinance that clearly was not adhered to. In hind sight, I should have picked a restaurant with outside seating.  The food was good. I enjoyed the German Potato Salad and the schnitzel tasted better when topped with the pickled cabbage. My daughter enjoyed her bratwurst and I must say that I actually liked the sauerkraut. It's not something I typically enjoy but the one served here did not have the strong fermented taste to it.   All together, we enjoyed our dining experience. I just wish they would have enforced the restaurant capacity that's currently in place."

It was called Bavarian Bistro or something like that.  We are glad we did! The service was good. We stopped for a late lunch on Saturday and had no wait. We chose the Goulash which was very hearty and short on the meat (maybe 2-3 oz) but meat was tender and tasty. We are split a plate of jaegerschnitzel (a breaded and fried pork steak with a rich mushroom gravy.) served with sweet red cabbage and home made German potato salad. They charge I believe either $2.95 or $3.95 for bread but we lucked out with what we ordered and got two pieces. It was excellent. It was a generous portion! Also had a large draft German beer draft. So this place is a bit pricey $54 for lunch plus a tip but we wanted some authentic German food for a change and they did not disappoint! We enclosed a pic so you can see a little ambiance and what was left of the food! Lol. We finished it all!"

The food was really good, but it's just something to keep in mind if you have small hungry kids with you. Also, wish they had more options for kids. The spaghetti bolognese that they did share was a good portion. I didn't know what to expect since I've never had real German food. I was super impressed though. Tried the Jager schnitzel which came with a fried pork cutlet and mushrooms. The schnitzel was cooked perfectly. The gravy that accompanied it was flavorful and the sides balanced everything out perfectly. Although the red cabbage and mashed potato were a little on the sweet side, it all made sense somehow. Definitely go when it's not too crowded and you'll love the food."

Also that the quail that normally comes with rice and green beans, I was allowed to sub mashed potato's and mixed veg, that comes with other entrees.  When I got my quail, it was OVERLY and overwhelming SALTY!!! So terribly salty! And the 'vegetables', onion, peppers mostly with about 3 pieces of broccoli, raw carrot and yellow squash were barely cooked, so hard you couldn't eat them...but the mash was very good! They attempted to cook the veg a second time but it came out covered in grease and just as Rick hard!  My husband ordered the bratwurst plate and his potatoes were fried to oblivion (why don't they put mash with sausage! Not fried potato chunks), and his brat was so DRY and OVERCOOKED, it literally had no moisture in it and he couldn't cut it with his knife.  Horrible food, badly prepared and of course we paid full price for the disgusting stuff!"

I asked 3-4 locals where to go to catch the packers vs rams game and all of them said Cultures was the best place as their very first suggestion. I see why now. Great staff, tons of beer (heavy on the German varieties), wine list, apps, and a full menu of grubs. I went with a 12 oz strip steak with double vegetables for my sides. At $22 it was not a bad deal and the dish was on point as well. The hefeweizen I got was OK but not amazing, most German beer does not impress me mind you. The bartender I had was really cool and very tentative. The place got busy fast during the game but I like a busy sports bar. More so when over half of them were on my side rooting for the packers!"

The fried pickles came out cold and the chicken nuggets seemed microwaved. We asked for A1 sauce and the bottle had two drops in it. The staff is great and so is the music . Not all the staff wears a mask which is a concern. It's a little loud inside but a great bad atmosphere. The outside is a bit more romantic and quite more for families and less rowdy. You can get a great dining experience either way."

I have to admit that I was disappointed in the Jagerschnitzel as it tasted gamey and did not taste like the authentic German food we tasted over 8 years in Germany.    Gave it 3 stars as the atmosphere was nice but the food not so authentic to my palette. The beer-battered mushrooms and purple cabbage were very good.  Potato soup was a little too salty."

                "description": "It looked fun from the outside and was oddly one of the only restaurants open (at 4:30pm on a Sunday - wtf Fredericksburg restaurants??), so we went in. We sat outside in the sun and there was some live music down the other end of the alleyway, playing at a perfect volume. The drink selection was decent and frozen drinks were pretty good. In ordering, our waiter did not know what I meant by \"feta\" (leaving it off my salad) and I was not mumbling any of the four times I repeated the word. Brush up on your menu items if you're a waiter. Just a thought. One meal came out wrong but it was her second choice (not stated) so she just ate it anyway, a bit worried the waiter wouldn't understand that either and mess up again. The food (salads) were very fresh and delicious. I'd recommend renewing the staff. The hostess looked like a high school kid at their first part-time job; slumped in a chair at the door, on her phone, feet up, and wearing a hoodie and jeans like she was lounging around her house. Her attitude was nice enough, but appeared so lazy. I noticed the rest of the staff didn't seem to have the same uniforms/shirts on. Then of course there was our low-brain-cell waiter. It's not enough to be friendly/nice - competence is more important and inspires more confidence in a good time at a restaurant."

We chose this place to have a light lunch so we only ordered from the appetizer menu.   *chicken tortilla soup was surprisingly delicious. It looked very creamy and almost like a queso dip with chips, but it was very flavorful and not too rich. The green bell peppers and chicken give the soup a good flavor. I'm not usually a creamy soup type of person, but this was quite good.   *the fried mushrooms looked heavily battered and scary fried when they first came out. We thought \"oh no, it's a heart attack waiting to happen!\", but WOW, the batter is so crispy and light and you can really enjoy a very good size mushroom every time. They were not heavily fried at all. The Mexican in me wanted a little kick so I asked for Valentina sauce and mixed it with the ranch. Delish!   *the beef and chicken potato skins were not a favorite. The potato with meat and cheese makes it too dense and very dry. We only one one each. They didn't have a decent amount of chicane beef, though.   Overall, I had a very experience and would come back. 3.7"

Looks like they had lots of beers and wines to choose from, but we're not drinkers. The Wienerschnitzel and the Opa's sausage plates were both really good, with great flavor and plenty of food. Entrées were between $15 and $17, our total bill for two with Iced tea was right at $40+tip. Great service from Peter and the rest of the crew. The sausage I ate was just regular Opa's sausage (which is a favorite to begin with), but the skin lightly sliced open and just barely crispy, which I found very good. Her Wienerschnitzel was tasty, too."

                "description": "This place is billed as American, Mexican, and German food.  I admit, I haven't been to Germany, but I have had a lot of German potato salad in the U.S., and Cultures has *THE BEST* German potato salad I have EVER had in Fredericksburg.  It has the perfect balance of vinegary and sweet sugary taste to it.  The potatoes are cooked perfectly tender enough, but not overcooked.  PERFECT is the best way to describe it.  Dinner entrees include two sides AND choice of soup or salad.    The Pepper Schnitzel entree ($16.99) is a breaded pork cutlet, topped with red and green bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, and paprika sauce.  Nothing really out of the ordinary here, but the pork is nice and tender.  The paprika sauce is very flavorful, but too heavy on the salt side for me.  The same goes for the grilled veggies that comes with it - just too salty. The side salad it came with was awesome. Real greens (not plain old iceberg lettuce) and it included tons of chopped tomatoes and was covered with shredded cheese.  Another one of my favorites here is the entree sized Avocado Salad ($10.99) - really good - it comes dressed in lime juice and olive oil, and with a small handful of tortilla chips and salsa on the side. The salsa is REALLY good and flavorful. I recommend breaking up the chips over the salad and spreading the delicious salsa over it.  Fresh, tasty greens, tomatoes, black beans, red onions, and yellow peppers, and a decent amount of avocado.  The only negative is, there could have been more avocado since it was featured in the name of the salad.  They have at least a couple of dozen German, Mexican, and American craft beers on tap.  12 oz beers are $5, .5 liter beers are $7, or you can go with the giant 1 liter Das Boot for $12.  We're in Texas, so go big or home y'all.  Das Boot for the win!"

One place had some of the best Sangria I have ever tasted! I would do this pedal pub again. You are completely covered in shade. You don't really have to pedal because it's electric.

We showed up at Jimmys uncles bar to meet there and we get a few drinks and then get the news that the pedal tour is cancelled. We tried time and time again to get ahold of jimmy and they would not answer the call. Then we called from a different phone number (from what we booked with) and Cheryl promptly picked up and told us \"oh yeah it's cancelled, we're at a polo event right now, we'll refund you the money on Monday.\" Suffice it to say, we were (still are) upset. The bartender at the Stable bar that we met at was very nice though. She was caught in between a business owner that doesn't like to contact their customers and us."

We paid over $400 for this tour for 9 girls for my bachelorette party. We were never given a call or email notifying us that they were not planning on showing up. We called 52 times in a row until someone finally picked up. They were vague and said they would get back to us. Since then we have made repeated attempts to get a hold of this company to ensure a refund. Every time we call the company we are given the run around and met with extremely rude comments from employees. The only apology we received was filled sarcasm. It's been nearly a month and we have not been issued a refund. It's a shame that a company would hold onto people's funds during a pandemic when money is tight for many. Also a shame to know based on some comments this is regular practice for them. Do not book with this company."

With the weather being so hot, we chose a night time tour on a Monday night. We received an immediate email stating that our request was received but wouldn't be confirmed until we heard back from them with a confirmation. We waited. We called.  We even went by the address given. It was closed. Finally at 4:30pm on the day we had requested, we received an email saying our tour was declined due to lack of participants. Other people have stated they did the tour with only two people, but they wouldn't honor our reservation for two people. It would have been nice and I would have been more understanding if their communication had been better. At the very least they could have called us and explained or offered us an earlier time slot (if the later time was problematic), but we simply got an email stating our tour was canceled, leaving us scrambling for new plans for the evening. Quite a letdown in what was otherwise a fun trip. A little communication would have gone a long way."

It's $25 per person for 4 wine samples, but they give you a list with descriptions and you choose which ones you want. The sommelier was very friendly and gave us great info on all the wines! I really liked getting to choose which wines I was trying. I even decided to take a bottle home since they do not sell to any major retailers.  Grape Creek has a large vineyard right outside the town on 290 that you can pay to tour but we were walking down Main and decided to pop into this location."

The sommelier did a great job explaining each wine so we could make the best selection. He was also very well informed about everything from the grape growing process to the wine making and aging. He was all very pleasant to interact with and made the experience fantastic. Per the sommelier, the wine menu is very stable and rarely changes, last change being about 8 years ago."

Bitter experience, invited to never, ever come back here.  There are plenty of beautiful places around Fredericksburg to enjoy."

They were really watered down or super bitter. The sweet wines were either overly sweet (just syrup) or they shouldn't be considered a sweet wine at all.  $25 for a tasting of 3.... ridiculous in my opinion. You do get a fancy glass but $25 for not even an ounce of wine is insane.  The place is really pretty, fancy, we felt special being in there... until we dealt with the workers.  My mom even had an allergic reaction to one of the wines, no one seemed to care and in my opinion, that means they put something sketchy in their wine.  Enter at your own risk, also, don't fall for the membership. It's a hassle to deal with."

However, it became very clear early in our tasting that the goal of the person pouring was to get us to join the wine club. She was telling us all about the benefits and the \"low cost\" to join. I was told it would be between $90-$100.00 per shipment. Excited about the possibility of having a wine that I was not able to purchase in my home state delivered I signed up. I was charged $157.00 without an email or any notification. I called the winery and was told they had the wrong email, although they had the correct phone number. I inquired about the cost and relayed what I had been told in the tasting room. I was told taxes and shipping were the cause of the higher price. I withdrew from the club as they do not let you know ahead of time what the cost will be. Upon receiving the first shipment and opening it, I was disappointed to find just the three bottles of wine, no letter about the wine or instructions to let the wine rest since it had been shipped. As I had received from other wine clubs I was a part of. It seems to me they have a lot to learn!! Overall, I would not recommend joining this wine club."

Our first problem was that we didn't have a reservation for a testing. The hostess worked with us and got us a spot for a testing and put in a charcuterie board order. She placed us outside and told us to wait for our server. The weather was about 50 degrees and there wasn't a heater available for us. 10 minutes later, we still didn't have our server. The hostess came out and got us water. We asked for a heater or if we could get the first available table inside, she agreed and went to find our server. 10 minutes later, a server came up to us, apologized for the wait and got us a table inside.  A wine tasting for two took about 2 hours, which was not ideal. We had to ask for our charcuterie board three times with two different servers. We finally got it at the last glass of wine and ended up getting a full glass of wine to compliment the board. All in all, it was great but next time we will have a reservation and will be more vocal about the lack of service.  5 glass tasting was $20 and board was $30."

                "description": "This place was recommended by other staff members from other wineries. We were so looking forward to it! Unfortunately we ran into some friend and chatted until 4:34pm. When we went inside we were told they where \"closed\" and to make a reservation on their website. \"It was the way locals do it\", is what one employee said. Needless to say we were disappointed in their lack of customer focus even after explaining on situation. It seems like the employees are there for a paycheck and not there supporting their vineyard or brand. We were extremely disappointed when we were asked to leave, in a very aggressive manner, after going back to our friends. The wine might be good here (I don't know and never will) but the staff doesn't care either way so don't expect much from them."

Found this little tasting room and had a great experience. We enjoyed each of the wines we tasted, even the whites and we are not white wine drinkers. The gal who served us was super friendly and knowledgeable. A live musician was about to start playing but we had to get back on the road. Super cute place, friendly staff, nice environment! We ended up purchasing a couple of bottles and I hope to be able to find the brand in the future!"

She was very knowledgeable and let us know which cheeses paired best with the wine we were about to taste. We aren't super versed in wine, so she gave us enough information without overwhelming us with chatter. We really enjoyed the ambiance and how every single staff member were wearing their masks properly. They also handled social distancing very well. As we were finishing up with our tasting, we noticed that it was a few minutes left til closing. Jolee didn't rush us out. She offered us a bottle of wine to finish off our tasting and said she would just check up on us. I would definitely recommend coming here!"

Abigail was our server and not only was she very knowledgeable about the wine but she was personable and friendly as well!

If you haven't figured it out by now, you have your pick when it comes to wineries, however this place has some of the nicest people working there and the wine is good as well.   I pulled up and was immediately greeted. I told her I was just looking around and she guided me in and gave me a run down. She let me know that they were offering a 5 flight tasting for $15. I explained that I was meeting a friend for lunch (and got some recommendations of where to go eat) and that we would be back.   We ate lunch (it was delicious) and came back. Chris helped us and he was funny and informative and made sure that we were having a great time. In the process we also got to meet Troy (one of the co-owners) and got to ask him questions as well.   After much sipping, we got a glass and went outside where they was covered seating and live music.   This place wasn't as crowded as some of the places on Main Street, but I loved the experience we had and we will definitely be back!!!"

It only took about an hour and a half to get there and there were quite a few wineries along the way if you wanted to visit some more (we stopped at one on the way back).  We signed up for the tour, but had a little bit of time to kill before it started, so we had a glass inside. We tried a red and a rose and the pours were very generous. The wine was great and we ended up buying a few bottles.  Of course we picked one of the coldest days out of the year to go, but they were very accommodating and it was mostly inside anyway. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and he has been there since they first opened, so it was really awesome to hear from his experience. During the tour, we got to taste a few different whites and reds and then got to keep the cup.   My only recommendation would be to set up some heaters outside. Even though it was really cold, it was a beautiful sunny day, and it would have been nice to enjoy the beautiful scenery outside. Overall, it was a great experience!"

We visited during the week (so nice they are open during the week!) so it was slower than it is on the weekend I'm sure, but we received great attention and service from the sweetest host, Sue! Highly recommend asking for Sue for your tasting here. Her great personality and excitement for the wine and the wonderful reds sold us on a membership here.   As for the wine, love that they are all dry. The reds are amazing, every single one! Favorites were the Tannat and Cab!   Great visit first to Augusta Vin, many more to follow I'm sure!"

                "description": "Escape just outside of central Fredericksburg to this BEAUTIFUL vineyard with very impressive wines! The long driveway in from the main road has you entrenched in vines and the vast, expansiveness of the Texas countryside. Once you finally arrive, you stumble upon an exquisitely designed tasting room with surrounding lounge areas and belly-up bars. The tasting room is just half of the experience though, the wines are quite impressive!  My group and I tried the mixed tasting flight and red tasting flight, allowing a chance to try 10 wines. We found ourselves unable to decide which pour was  our favorite because so many were so delicious! If you go with a partner or friend and feeling like trying as many wines as you can, I definitely recommend splitting those two flights! A few of my group members even ended up joining because they were so impressed.   TLDR: A little drive out from the main area of Fredericksburg but so worth it!"

Called to ensure that we were able to bring our small service dog that fits in a bag for the tour. When we checked in at the front desk, we had our dog with us, we were greeted by the hostess who gave us instructions on where to wait for the tour to start. We patiently waited and once the tour was about to start the guide told us they couldn't let us on the tour with the dog. I understand if that is your policy, however, it would have been helpful if that was clarified when we checked in for the tour instead of making us waste our time. There are plenty of wineries in the area that we could've been at during that time instead. We asked to use the money we had already paid towards our tab and were told that would be an \"accounting nightmare\" like seriously!? They did refund the part of the tour that we couldn't go on but their customer service and communication definitely needs improvement.  Their website does not include any information in regards to this topic when booking, which is why we called to confirm. Other guests have had similar experiences based on the reviews below."

When we got here the host was very annoyed that we didn't make reservations and told us to find our own open seats. I told her I was a wine member and it made her even more annoyed. After making us feel uncomfortable she sat us down and told us she could sit us in the members only section for an hour and we had to be out because reservations were made for others. This was our first stop and we didn't mind only having an hour. (Really we just wanted to take pictures) Our server was so sweet and attentive. About 40 minutes in we asked for the checks and our server went to go get them. The host then came up and was staring at us and then told us she needed the chairs. We still had 20 minutes, our waiter was closing us out and there was so many empty tables. She continued to clean around us, pull chairs and make us feel uncomfortable that my face started turning red and i told my party to walk downstairs and I would finish up with the bill. It was beyond embarrassing. Our server apologized so many times and even had me speak to the manager who said they were aware of the problem. Such a shame because it is a beautiful place. Just not the kind of experience I wanted to give to the people I love most."

Their pours are on the smaller side (1oz) compared to some other places, but it was a wonderful experience overall!"

                "description": "We wanted to do a wine tasting/tour in Fredericksburg. There are so many winery it's a bit stressful to choose which one. But I'm happy we decided on this place!   The venue is gorgeous - classy and spacious! You can also book this space for weddings. They have outdoor and indoor seating so if you don't feel comfortable during covid you can sit outside. However if you wanted to do the wine tasting you have to sit indoors and you are free to move outdoors afterwards.   We originally had booked a wine tour but it got cancelled. My recommendations is to call them beforehand to double check your tour bookings. We ended up just doing wine tasting with charcuterie boards + truffle. The reserve wine was really good. I prefer it more than the red wine tasting which my friend had gotten. I think it's worth paying the extra $5.   The place is very busy so service was a bit slow - but our server is so friendly! My friends and I are slow drinkers anyways so it didn't bother us as much. We went on a Saturday and they were fully packed in the afternoon so definitely recommend making a reservation if you plan on doing the tasting. If you're here to just buy a cup/bottle of wine I think you can just drop by for the outdoor seating.   This is a perfect girls mini road trip! We drove from Austin and it was worth the visit. Also very cute photo opportunity :)"

We got the rose jam, peach jam, strawberry preserves, some peach cider, and the cobbler! The peach jam and strawberry preserves were delicious, and the rose jam was pretty good too! Our favorite has to be the cider though, and it tasted really good with the cobbler! They also had a beautiful outside with a pond, and it was perfect weather when we visited, which made it super nice! The prices are also pretty decent, and definitely worth it for what you get. Also pretty family friendly, so don't worry about bringing your kids here. Can't recommend enough, and we'll definitely come back to this place next time we visit Fredericksburg!"

I wish I'd read reviews prior to paying $4 per \"tasting\" that was a joke. It's maybe, maybe an ounce. You go to a machine that you insert a card to that has your credits to it. As I said it's a spit and I'm being kind giving them the ounce it provides.   Views are amazing and the food retail product has some yummy finds. I spent lots of money altogether so hoping my food finds will make up for the joke of a tasting."

                "description": "This place is gorgeous! Beautiful outdoor seating near a lake and a view of the peach orchard. This place doesn't really have a tasting like most other places in Fredricksburg, rather you can load money to a card and use the card to self serve different amounts of wine from their dispensing system. That ended up being quite expensive as it starts at $4 for a single ounce of wine, but the wines they have are so good. This is the spot if you like sweet and fruity wines. My favorites were the peach wine and the blackberry wine. The star is definitely the peach wine though - make sure you try that one and take home a bottle.   The little shop also has a ton of cool things for sale. One thing I would skip however is the peach cobbler, at $8 its too much for the tiny portion and not all that great. The sauces and jams are great though. The peach cider was also a cool find and quite refreshing for anyone that doesn't drink or anyone that needs a break from alcohol."

We tried the peach salsa, which instantly became an addiction to us, we left with four jars.  We even bought a jar of their famous raspberry chipotle sauce so I'm excited to try that. Every single one of the staff members talked to us about how great it is.  The only thing I can complain about was the wine. The wine was HORRIBLE. I really REALLY wish I could have gotten my money back for it. We ended up throwing away  3 of them because neither me nor my mom could stomach them.  They all tasted like cough syrup or just pure nastiness, I can't even describe it. Worst wine we've ever tasted in our life.  I would 100% come back for everything else, but skip the wine."

They also offer wine tastings and wine by the glass options. The best part is the view of in the back. It's a relaxing environment around the water with a chance to enjoy the landscaping with the pretty trees. They have a good amount of seating and picnic tables to sit and relax. I highly recommend this place."

We had a charcuterie board for dinner tonight and it paired with Everything. Just a small amount goes a long way for flavor.

In other words, this place is everything you want from a visit to a small town.   They were really good about enforcing face masks and the use of hand sanitizer in the shop. (My trip to Main Street after I noticed most places didn't care about those things). I may have grabbed a few of the famous chipotle sauce along with some other peach infused goodies.   The Friday that I came here, they were not offering any wines by the glass for enjoying in the outdoor area. I was told that was an option on Saturday and Sunday. You could buy a chilled bottle of wine but I was driving and solo so not an option. None the less, I took a leisurely walk around the pond, enjoying the peace and all of the beautiful views.   Great local business to support while also enjoying their beautiful scenery."

We were with our kids (20's and teen) who looked it up online on the way and got excited about some menu items they saw on the website.  We've never been here and weren't sure what to expect. We thought we'd enjoy some food and wine.  First off, the place is beautiful!  Rustic Texas charm through and through!  There's a gorgeous pond out back with Adirondack chairs, and plenty of spots for relaxing.   When we entered the store, we weren't sure of what to do.  It's a cute open southern vintage store lots of jams, sauces, etc.  There are other rooms branching off the main store and we know they have a culinary school on site.  We didn't see what appeared to be a restaurant (or eating area) so we milled around, waiting for an available employee.  We decided to wander out back and check out the scenery.  It is stunning!  We took a few photos and walked around a bit.  The place is absolutely beautiful. There were a few people relaxing on chairs drinking wine by the pond.   When we came back into the store, the employees were still busy with customers so we looked at items in the store. It didn't seem that anyone was eating food so we were confused about the menu on the website, especially since we were there during the menu hours.  After realizing how chatty the customers were, it seemed an employee would not be available anytime soon so we decided to head out. We'll definitely check it out next time after doing a little more research."

There was no tour online so we just went hoping for a tasting. As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted and graciously offered a production tour. Charlie did a stellar job! We sat down afterwards and enjoyed a charcuterie board with a glass of wine while listening to the perfect live music duo. We will definitely be back! Well done!!!!"

Josh (I think that's right and my apologies if it isn't) has a great singing voice, even if I only found that out because he scared the s#*t out of me   The live music really did the trick. David Selbo was on the mic playing his guitar. The covers he was crooning didn't even sound like covers...he made them completely his own and the atmosphere was positively impacted as a result.   It was, all in all, a really awesome venue. I look forward to going back and actually drinking wine."

The owners are the sweetest family you'll ever meet--great wine and people. You have to stop by when you're in town. Oh, and don't forget to ask them to tell you the story about the old pioneer house on the property! Rumor is that it's haunted!"

Really blown away by the service here we really felt like we were part of the family and definitely treated as such. Their outside area is really beautiful with amazing rocking chairs this was an awesome touch that I have never ever seen before! Kudos for originality and thinking outside of the box. The wine tour was also incredibly informative and fun we got to try more wines and were taken to the barrel room at the end of the tour which was a great experience. Really recommend this winery, it has absolutely everything that you would want!"

It was so good we left with a membership. We're really looking forward to our future visits and future bottles we'll be drinking. Slate Mill is all about supporting and putting Texas wine at the top. We're proud to support and continue to be customers for years and years to come. Definitely recommend!!!"

Derek helped us out and had great knowledge of the wines we tasted (the 1851 collection). We had some nice note comparisons and little discussions with him as well. The service was great and they really take care of you.  The wines themselves were delicious and I enjoyed each one tremendously. The Trebbiano and the Cabernet Sauvignon were my two favorites."

                "description": "Finding this place was an adventure in itself. Not even overexaggerating, I must have passed at least 16 vineyards before reaching this one. Not to mention that the bartender that took care of me shared how there were gonna be at least 20 - 40 new vineyards being currently built within the next 4 years. For a wine lover like myself that was music to my ears.  One of the main reasons I decided to visit this place while passing a plethora of others was the fact that they stayed opened later than the others. If you want to feel like a baller and classy, this is definitely the place to check out. Not also are the grounds beautiful and the wine delicious, but they also have villas if you wanted to make a true adventure out of it all.  Everyone, from the guest and staff, were very friendly and courteous. A MUST to check out if you're ever in the area."

Despite having many guests (including a big party), they were very attentive and knowledgeable about each wine we were enjoying. The outdoor pavilion was also quite beautiful. Very picturesque! I wished I made it on a day they had live music... but there's always next time!  Each wine tasting was quite lovely. We did order a charcuterie board and was surprised it came out on a paper plate wrapped with cellophane. I understand this is due to the ongoing COVID-19, but I did wish that the presentation could be a tad bit classier. The cheese + meats + other goodies on the board were delicious and complemented the wines well though! Would love to come back to Baron's Creek Vineyards again."

You do need a reservation for the tasting, but for the Tesla wall connector you can just plug in. They just ask you don't leave the car all day.   We did a mixed tasting and shared a margarita pizza. The pizza was not that good, but at least the wine was. The wine maker sources most of his grapes from California. It was honestly the best Fredericksburg wine I've had. I ended up joining the 3-bottle a quarter membership. It's a great place to charge my car, they have a members lounge, wine is reasonably priced and comp tastings. There are lawn games in the bag and villas to stay at."

They have a great selection of wine to taste. Most importantly, the customer service is amazing! Special shout out to Roslyn (sorry if I butchered that) and Matthew for making our experience fun!

                "description": "This is a good winery to go to if you like live music and the outdoors. This winery has several buildings and tasting rooms. Some part of this winery needs reservations, but you are able to come in and grab a table as long as you have a party less than 6 people. If you also want to get away, I believe they also offer bed and breakfast that you can rent. It looks like the property has housing that are within the winery. Wine selection here is great! The only thing that made me give this place a 4/5. Was the charcuterie board, it comes pre-package and so if you are looking for more elegance on the charcuterie board, I'd say there's isn't the most picturesque. However the wine here is really good.   Also, since we are during covid times. It would probably be best if you purchase a couple bottles of wine and find a table outside. Everything is spaced out to adhere to social distancing. Also, one thing that is unique about this winery is that they make pizza here! So you are able to order that if in case you are looking to eat  effort indulging in wine! Enjoy!"

                "description": "This is a review of the experience and setting rather than the wine since we actually didn't get around to trying any. We had selected Baron's as a stop on our Hill county wine tour specifically because it was so well reviewed and the estate looked gorgeous. That much is true: the grounds are well manicured, expansive, and the building looks like a fancy villa. But as classy as the exterior looks, I found the atmosphere to be strangely trashy and bar-like. The outdoor space was dominated by what looked like drunk college kids. We ended up going over to the pavilion and sitting at one of the weirdly sterile-looking circular tables to listen to the musician strumming away on a guitar. It felt too much like we were at a wedding or church function, so we ended up just heading back to our car and heading elsewhere. I know they were busy, but our interactions with the staff were also rather cold and unwelcoming, which didn't help our feeling out of place. Maybe Baron's is better suited for large groups rather than couples, but the vibe just wasn't for us."

Not bad at all considering the wines are not sold in stores.   The pizza was also really great.   Though I would like to say that we did not feel welcomed initially. We reserved a private bottle tasting which was located on the right hand side inside. The server was not eager to have us and sent us back to the hostess stand which made it an awkward experience for my fiancé and I, even the hostess.   So we finally got to our 2nd server who was amazing and remedied the awkward feeling. It was cold outside but we felt very warm by the heaters. Looking forward to taking advantage of the member benefits in the future!"

I ordered the charcuterie and none of it was easily accessible. What I mean was none of the cheese was sliced just so you could grab it but we were not given cutlery to do anything about it. The table was super tiny between the four of us, our glasses and the charcuterie. The place is pretty hit that's about it."

You can make a reservation online which was super simple, kudos for that. Their outdoor area is so pretty, we went on a rainy day but they had heaters and a covered area so we were still able to enjoy the space. The food is a little pricey but other than that a really awesome vineyard."

                "description": "This was our first stop on a whirlwind our of Hill Country wineries and ended up as our likely favorite. We undoubtedly enjoy drinking wine and do so often but are complete novices when it comes to the art of viniculture. Thankfully, the numerous employees who rotated through and engaged with us during our tasting were friendly and knowledgeable, unpretentious, and clearly loved their jobs. We were seated at the central bar and the tasting room itself was warm and welcoming, with high ceilings and lovely natural light. The Indian twist was really unique, from the auto-rickshaw out front to the wallpaper in the bathroom to the very name of the winery, though I have to say as an Indian-American myself that the savory snacks on the menu are tasty but extremely overpriced. We got to try several varietals that we had never had before (e.g., Roussane, Tannat) that were really delicious and none of them, even the Muscat, were overly saccharine. On top of all this, Kalasi is an advocate and supporter of Texas-grown wines and wineries and engages in sustainable farming practices, partially by employing some on-site sheep and a llama. A really enjoyable way to spend an afternoon that I highly recommend!"

The tasting room is bright and spacious (great for staying your distance from others). The tasting room employees are friendly and knowledgeable without being pretentious. And the outdoor space is to die for! Picturesque trees with anorak chairs below to take in the surrounding view while sipping on world class wine from Texas! Grapes are grown by the family and care is taken from soil to bottle with each wine. A family affair that you can't get enough of!"

                "description": "Kalasi offered one of the best winery experiences we have had in awhile, especially during COVID. We normally prefer outside but actually felt safe inside here because they had everyone spaced out at the bar, and the tasting room has really high ceilings and felt airy. The service was great... Darryl and the owners were all so kind and took the time to chat and tell us about the winery and offer recommendations for other places in the area. It's pronounced \"KAL-ah-see\", if I remember correctly, and means \"together\" since it's a husband and wife who started it.  The wine is great. The tannat and Sangiovese were our favorites, but they were honestly all good... even the whites, which are not normally our favorites. We took some home. But the thing that really topped it all off for us was the food. I've never seen Indian food at a winery and it was absolutely delicious! The samosas and tikka masala pizza actually went really well with the wine. They appeared to be just reheated from frozen (it's not like they have a full restaurant, it's just a light menu they started serving due to COVID rules) but don't let that dissuade you, it was amazing.   The location is kind of in a residential area, so we would never have just passed by (thank you Yelp!) but it is so close to Fredericksburg, and very convenient. Visit, and don't forget to say hi to the sheep and llama!"

The first time we visited back in November, the owners Greg and Nikhila were so welcoming. They shared their story about setting up the new winery and introduced us to all the sheep and their handsome protector, Dalai the llama. The great wine was just a bonus!  I was lucky enough to get away for a weekend HAD to get a reservation at Kalasi. Christi took care of our small group. She was wonderful--introduced me to a few new wines and taught me about the different wine varieties. We ended up leaving with multiple bottles and this will definitely be my first stop the next time I'm in Fredericksburg.  My favorites: Malbec New favorite: Muscat--crisp, refreshing, and not too sweet"

I commented on the size of pour and they brushed off the comment. Bring your own pallet cleanser, they offered me none. Save your money and ask for a glass of Carmenere. It was very well done. Everything else is not worth the cost. I was disappointed to find out that unlike the  practice of most wineries, they don't waive tasting fee if you buy a set number, usually 3, bottles.  Tasting fees are more than a bottle."

The tasting room is spacious and comfortable and the owner and employees very nice.  We did not do a tasting as we had recommendations from family, but purchased a bottle of Malbec and drank it outside on their beautiful grounds and enjoyed the scenery.  They have a few friendly sheep and a llama in a nearby field and they are fun to watch.  We did try a few other wines and all were very nice.  So nice, we purchased a few bottles to take home with us.  We will definitely visit here again!"

Staying at Barons Creekside was a last minute decision to escape from our airport life and find some peace and quiet. We found that and more during our 5 day stay.  From the minute we arrived, the simplicity of the check-in process ( Just pick your keys up from the mailbox at The Club ), to having precut firewood available right by the cabin impressed us.  The combination of amazing log cabins, outdoor fire pits and charcoal BBQ's, all nestled together on gently rolling terrain with a subtle but much appreciated hint of privacy,  showed us we had selected the perfect getaway.  The ability to just enjoy a quiet evening on the patio or join in the fun at The Club located on the property was the icing on the cake.  Also, the proximity to downtown Fredericksburg, as well as over 70 Vineyards, Peach Harvesting, and Horseback Riding put the stay over the top.   We had an amazing vineyard tour of Kuhlman's Winery one day and a relaxing 2 hour trail ride at the Blue Moon Ranch the next evening. Highly recommend both of these adventures. We even worked in a quick afternoon trip to Luckenbach TX (home of Texas Country Music).  Evenings brought some amazing live music at The Club as well as some excellent wines right from the vineyard located on the property.  Lastly, the amazing staff that Daniel and Deborah have put together shows what incredible people they are!! Their staff never missed a beat.  Believe us when we say, this is a hidden gem in the Texas Hill Country you will want to come back to again and again. We will !!!!"

                "description": "This resort is the PERFECT getaway, especially during the Coronavirus pandemic. The cabins are secluded enough from each other that we rarely even saw anyone else. Check in/Check out was so easy. We stayed in the Mesquite Farmhouse. It was so quaint and expertly appointed. We had every amenity we could possibly need. As a bonus, a family of deer must live nearby as they were often prancing around the back yard throughout our stay.    It's close to downtown Fredericksburg, it's a stone's throw from the main highway, 290 and close enough to the wineries, Luckenbach, and Enchanted Rock State Park.   The only thing we will do differently next time is bring several of our friends  to enjoy it with us."

Great Swiss cabins with quiet, peaceful and tranquil grounds just a few minutes' drive from downtown and all Fredericksburg has to offer.  The Club on the property is a great place to chill with drinks and eats and weekend live music just a short walk from  your cabin porch. Lightning bugs were plentiful at dusk which was a real treat.  I love this place.  I'll be back...."

                "description": "Barons Creekside is a peaceful place to get away from it all yet still close to Fredericksburg shopping and dining.  We stayed three nights in the Zug cabin in early April.  This cabin has nice front porch with rocking chairs from where we fed the ducks as they came by for their daily visit.  There is a little creek that runs through property which added to the tranquility.  The cabin is well appointed with coffee and tea provided.   The weather was cool so we used the large fireplace a two nights.  Ample firewood was just a short walk away.  We dined at the on property venue, \"The Club\" and enjoyed a fine meal and some live music.  The menu was somewhat limited but with interesting options.  The food and service was very good.  We made use of the charcoal grill one evening which is sized just right for a meal for two.  We enjoyed Barons Creekside so much that we plan to make an annual visit there."

As we drove to Fredericksburg, the rain started and the temperature dropped 30 degrees, and it didn't stop there. But the adorable Zug cabin offered a wonderful retreat from the cold, damp outside. We built a roaring log fire, barbequed dinner and opened a bottle of bubbly. The contact-less check-in/check-out was efficient, and the cabin was clean and offered everything we needed. We'll be back!"

This was our first trip to Fredericksburg, and I stumbled across Barons CreekSide online but really didn't know what it would be like in person. After looking at the geotagged pictures on Instagram, we decided to book it. Let me tell you, it wildly exceeded all of our expectations. We stayed in cabin Davos which was lovely and located near the entrance to the property. We enjoyed coffee on the swing behind our cabin each morning while we fed the adorable ducks. The staff was amazing - the owner of the property answers the phones and works in The Club each night, it was great to see him take such pride in his business and really stay involved. The experience was absolutely lovely and we cannot wait to come back! Thank you, Barons CreekSide!"

My wife and I honeymooned there and it's our Anniversary spot. When we drive in we will spend a few days hiking at Enchanted Rock and Perdinales Falls or climbing Old Baldy at the Frio River. And when we get back to the cabin we just enjoy the serenity, relax on the porch at the creek or on the couch. There's a great club on the property that opens in the evenings so you can enjoy the great wine selection and not have to drive. Just a beautiful stroll back to your cabin. There's a perch to watch the sunset that we always make sure to catch at least once during our trip. Daniel and the crew are great host and have always been quite friendly. There's history in every cabin out there and it's obvious when you walk in that it's special. There's no way to convey the place in words so I won't try. But everyone who goes will go back."

It was perfect for our small but growing family. Our pups enjoyed it too!  The grounds were perfect and it was incredibly quiet considering how close we were to Main Street. Our daughter has enjoyed the tree climbing and duck feedings. She looks forward to the s'mores and \"real fires\"!  The stone fireplace is quaint and the rockers on the porch are perfect for reading and relaxing. We always wondered what our \"family tradition\" would be.  All signs point to Baron's Creekside.  Daniel and Deborah (owners) have made us feel like family. We adore them.   We cannot wait to come back next year.   Note:  there's a bistro on the grounds. Live music, intimate setting and hella good wine. :) If you want some good food, a relaxing atmosphere and to enjoy the walk back to your cabin, this is the place. ;)"

                "description": "This review is solely for constructive feedback, not to put down a business.  I was truly excited about visiting this winery. The reviews on Trip Advisory had me sold! Even upon entry; I loved the smell of this French-country shop. They had soaps, salts, potpourri, and wonderful things of that nature. Behind all of these beautifully-bagged scents lied the wines. Everything looked clean and organized, and I was ready to sample. I was showed the list of preselected wines Becker offered. I was able to chose between drys, mixed, and whites. I picked mixed so I can try a both reds and whites. It cost $32 to sample 5 wines plus 1 rosé. Normally I have very good hearing, but today, the woman helping me was so soft-spoken, I had a difficult time hearing the description of the wines. I'd understand if it was loud inside, but it was quiet and her disposable mask was thin. I even noticed all of the wines she's poured had spouts that controlled how much wine came out of the bottle. It was about 2oz. Now, I understand everyone's taste buds differ, but the wines were not leave a positive impression on my palette. Beside the description of the taste, she didn't share much knowledge about the origin or history of the  wines. On the other hand, I also appreciated the souvenir wine glass I was able to keep for having sampled the wines. I think my wine tasting experience at Becker's could have been improved by having a more entertaining server, a bit more to sample per glass, and choosing my own samples."

NO ONE was there in the tasting room. NO ONE. We came to Fredericksburg to scout wineries for a major event in June. We live in San Antonio and know Becker Vineyards is a good company and the owners good people... but the guy who turned us away at 4:10 and said \"we are winding down for the day , so I will not serve you\" was a jerk. The sign outside said last serve was 4:30. If I owned a business I would encourage money in the coffers. I would encourage patronage in my establishment. We only wanted one glass of wine and to take in the atmosphere. To the guy who was too lazy to wait on us, shame on you. We won't be back- and we pass on your vineyard for our event."

As members, we can come with up to 3 of our friends for wine tasting or a glass of wine of our choice.  The staff here are wonderful.  The wine tasting room is in an old Buick building on Main Street.    I usually enjoy a glass of Raven Cabernet Sauvignon but they are sold out.  The Cabernet Fran is pretty delicious.  My husband enjoys the Muscat Canelli and my daughter likes the Clementine, a late harvest Sauvignon Blanc that my daughter LOVES.  The staff here are AWESOME.  And there have a GReAT charcuterie plate!!!   If you don't have time to visit the vineyard in Stonewall, TX, this is the next best thing.  Salut!!"

They give you tickets so when you're ready to try the next wine of your choice, you just turn in a ticket. This is great because you don't feel rushed at all and you can sit down with each wine and take your time if you want to sip it. There is a lot of seating inside and outside and you can even do some shopping while you sip inside the store. The inside of the shop is beautiful with a fun atmosphere.  I prefer dry red wines and they have plenty of those. All the wines I tried were amazing. They have a charcuterie board that I didn't get to try but I will for sure next time I go!"

                "description": "The staff is incredibly rude and tossed a towel at our table, then said clean it up. The it was ice cube, from a glass of water. When I asked to speak to the manager, Tyler refused to come out. I went inside to ask why the staff had been rude to my table, Tyler stated that it was my opinion that the staff had been rude and my opinion that the staff member had thrown a rag. i tried to explain to him the difference between a fact and an opinion and so did the table next to us, but he did not have the mental capacity to understand the difference. Tyler acted aggressive toward my self and my sister, and refused to apologize. This is at the least unprofessional and its my opinion he should no longer be employed. The incident caused us to cancel our membership of 4 years, Tyler did not care."

                "description": "Loved the tasting room. They have just about all the wines you would find out at the vineyard (maybe not reserve ones?) and do tastings here that are just the same. It's a lovely space, and the outdoor covered patio is also very nice.   The wine is very good, with the '17 Saigne rose' and the '14 muscat being my favorites.   The charcuterie plate was excellent, with very solid cheeses and meats, and a fig jam that is to die for, though if you're like myself and really NOT a fan of truffles, opt to get it without the truffle honey. At $24, it was significantly more well curated that similar plates at other locations, and could potentially constitute a meal for 2-3 people.  Will look to come back when next in Fredericksburg."

                "description": "This review is in response to Al. R's review written on 3/30/2021 to set the record straight... I was a member of a group sitting on the patio and witnessed everything go down that Al is accusing this establishment of. For once I am happy that being a member of a bachlorette group, we were not the ones causing a scene! We have always loved Becker Vineyards and we were all appalled to see how rude their poor staff was treated by these beyond wasted and rude people in Al's party. First off in my OPINION, children do not belong at a winery, especially when the adults taking care of the children are smashed. The children were loud and rowdy, there was ice being thrown and water was every where. It did not make for a peaceful wine drinking atmosphere at all. The adults' behavior was no better than the children's, and the only ones being aggressive were Al and I guess his sister. The yelling, screaming and cussing were completely outrageous and could be heard from inside and all the way down the street as they left. For the record, there was no towel thrown, a towel was brought out to the table and placed on the corner of the table to clean up the children's mess and the children immediately grabbed the towel and started throwing it at each other. It is obvious that these low life people blew this up into a huge scene to try and get something for free and when the manager did not back down to them and defended his employee it upset them even more causing them to act no better than a child throwing a temper tantrum. I knew to look for this review because they made it very clear while yelling and screaming off the property that they were going to write the worst review on Yelp. Also we heard them talking at their table previous to the big blow up... they had cancelled their wine club membership a long time ago and not that day because they are cheap and weren't happy with the lack of member befits due to covid. The manager, Tyler, came outside and individually apologized to every table for the disturbance this group had caused. Honestly Al and his entire party should be ashamed and embarrassed for how they acted and for the unpleasant scene they caused. Bless you Becker Vineyards and all your staff, we know you are doing an amazing job during these difficult and different times. Don't sweat the ugly people in this world like Al, he can go fly a kite and get drunk with children somewhere else."

                "description": "manager and employees are racists!! Do not go here!!! The other night I left with the most disgusting taste in my mouth and I didn't even try the wine. I was helping myself to the free samples of mulled wine when I over heard the older white lady who worked behind the bar tell the older white gentlemen manager that she \"thinks those N-words over there are drunk.\" Substituting the real word for N-word. She said it clear as day and it was meant to be between her and the manager but I was close enough to overhear their conversation.  I then saw the older white manager promptly go and confront the group of younger kids and told them to leave. The group left politely but seemed confused as to why they were being asked to leave. From my vantage point they didn't seem intoxicated but either way I would never use my dollars to support an establishment that employs racists. The owners of Becker should be disgusted and demand accountability for this unacceptable behavior. I also highly suspect this isn't the first time they used the laws of sobriety to deploy racism and segregate their customer base."

However we walked in 32 minutes before close and they refused to serve us due to us \"looking too intoxicated\". Don't get me wrong, I get that if we had been drinking, but we were completely sober. Honestly, it seemed as if they were simply looking for any excuse to close down early. Kind of disappointing since we had driven all of the way from Austin."

The selection of wines for tasting was extensive too! For $20, you are able to taste 7 (1 is complimentary depending on the day, so technically 6) wines and keep the wine glass as a souvenir. For $24, you can also get a meat and cheese board with prosciutto, smoked ham, salami, Parmesan, manchego, goat cheese, figs, macadamia nuts, artichoke, and apricots. Additionally, the interior design and decorations are industrial yet modern and beautiful!! There's plenty of seating as well as an area to shop for souvenirs and lounge. I'm definitely planning on coming back in the future!"

I'm not sure if it's because we came in around 45 mins before closing, but we went through 3 people until we got an official staff member to serve our party. Unfortunately I've forgotten his name, but I'm glad we ended up with him because he was wonderful! He was very good about offering us another drink if we didn't like one we had chosen and making sure we had a great time.   We each did a wine tasting and ordered bread with olive oil and a charcuterie board to share. The charcuterie board had great variety and was exactly what we needed to pair with our wine! It easily fed all 5 of us. I prefer white wine and tend to make a face anytime I drink red wine, but the Sweet Red was certainly my favorite! I honestly don't drink wine often, but if I did, I would have gotten a bottle.  I would definitely recommend stopping by on your wine wine journey in Fredericksburg!"

                "description": "Save your time and money and skip this winery! There are just too many other beautiful, welcoming places in the area with great wines made on-site in the area- and this is not one of them.   We stopped in without doing any research on the spot, because we were drawn in by the name and signage. I was surprised to find out that part of the \"safari\" theme is that none of their wines are made with grapes on the property. Instead, the \"safari\" theme is their creative way of selling wine made elsewhere. As it was explained to me, the owners own a share of the estate where the grapes are grown (or something like that) and technically make their own wines that are then shipped here, but that's a really elaborate story to say that it's not local wine. If tasting wine from the area is what you're here for, you can skip it. The wines I did taste, I didn't really enjoy. The woman pouring our wines kept recommending different ones than I had chosen which is normally welcome, but it's surprising that there are just so many she'd want to steer us away from.   I'm not sure what exactly we were hoping for as far as ambiance- but we were pretending to enjoy our wine while staring at a wide variety of dead animals (or fake mountings, we couldn't tell for sure) displayed with pride around the room.   But what was truly the worst about our experience was the service received. The manager on duty, John, treated our group so poorly from the moment we walked in. He spoke to members of our group in a low, mumbling voice so we could barely hear him and the things he said wasn't making sense. There was also another bartender that seemed to have it out for us, as she made snarky remarks about our group to John in passing that was loud enough for everyone to hear.   I have never been treated this way in any dining or drinking facility so I was shocked! In our small group, we had two members that were not drinking at all and they confirmed this peculiar behavior, so this is not a case of a fuzzy memory. We were ultimately asked to leave (we think- we're not really sure what John was saying or asking us to do). We asked to pay for our tastings which we were only a few tastings into, and John said there was no charge for the tastings ($21/each). We tried to insist on paying so we could tip our server, who was very kind to us, but we were told no. Our group was not loud or rowdy or drunk, we were just...normal. It was almost like they were trying to pick a group to throw out for fun, and zeroed in on us for some reason.   The whole experience was absolutely bewildering. It's too bad since I think the Safari theme is a fun and unique idea. But it is not executed well, and unfortunately the staff is what really made the experience awful."

I have been to Fredericksburg many times and am sad that I waited this long to try this place. This has shot up my list as one of my favorites down 290. Their customer service was amazing. Big shout out to Shelby for being so friendly, patient, gracious and VERY knowledgeable about the product she was sampling to us. She's also a great salesperson, as I am now a member. I was unable to get the names of the hostess's up front but they were very sweet and helpful as well. I highly recommend this winery (don't wait like I did!) they are also apart of the 290 bus route.

Truly an unforgettable experience and it pains me that I cannot remember the gentleman who did our tastings but he is in the background of the photo. We hit it off with him and had great conversation to the point we all hugged when we left! Can't wait to go back!"

                "description": "Loved Vaudeville! We were walking around and found this place for lunch. They have outdoor seating, but the bistro is downstairs when you walk in. Great vibe to this place. We ended up splitting our sandwiches in half and sharing with each other because we couldn't decide which sounded best. I was worried it was going to be too fancy for us, but it was very casual.    If stairs are challenging, I would suggest eating outside at street level as restrooms are located on the first floor. I do believe they have an elevator but doesn't take you down to the bistro, but worth asking to be sure.    We were feeling a little too hungover to drink but they have a lot of options here. Wish I could say we tried anything more than water and a diet coke lol. We'll be back next time though!"

                "description": "Although we have lunched at Vaudeville  several times over the past few years, this review is a follow-up, from a slightly different perspective. New Years Day, Marjan and I secured a reservation for our first evening dinner at the Bistro.      We were promptly seated at our reserved time, for holiday dinner offered \"menu fixe et prix fixe\", for four courses.        For the first course, all enjoyed creamy snow crab bisque.  The consensus?   Delicious!  Delicious!      For the second course, Marjan selected their seafood gratin, served in a small bowl, filled with morsels of lump crab, shrimp, leeks and artichokes.  The accompanying french bread was the perfect assist to the spoon for this exceptionally flavored offering.  My choice:  the beef carpacccio.  Razor thin slices of tenderloin, plated in petaloid fashion, topped with delicate vegetables, and surrounded by a syrupy sauce, sweeter and tastier than a balsamic.  Again, delicious.        Next up was the main course. Marjan had eyes...and appetite... for the grilled lamb rack, an entree with which she has significant skill in preparation, honed over the years in her kitchen.  In her opinion, the boned in flesh of the young creature was cooked in textbook fashion.   The sided gratin excellent, while the stewed beans were tasty, though in truth,  not exceptional.  I selected the braised akaushi beef, the celebrated meat of Japan, now more widely available in the States.  Prepared as it should be, the beef literally fell onto the tined fork.  Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned.  The polenta on the side was creamy delicious, not gritty as one may find.        We finished our meal with shared Vaudeville's version of tiramisu, and their gelato sundae. These were the chef's creative takes on standard sweet stuffs.   What can be said, other than just a perfect end to an exceptional meal!      Friends, we consider Vaudeville the gold standard of restaurants in Fredericksburg.  Our experience is one of consistently excellent customer service, professional staff delivering prompt attention to our needs without being intrusive, and most importantly, outstanding performance by their chef.  Some have considered the restaurant somewhat high priced.  We rather think the dining experience at Vaudeville is well worth the listing.  Marjan and I wholeheartedly recommend our favorite Fredericksburg restaurant:  Vaudeville!  Enjoy!  and Be Safe!!"

Good reviews, swanky interior, and  polite staff, but as people started to seat around us ordering their food and receiving it before ours?   HMMMMM?   40 Minutes goes by our drinks are empty and the  waitress has not come by to check on us, so we find her.   \"OH NO, IDK what happened?\" What happened to checking on people? If wait staff knew good service would prompt a 25%+  tip Im sure they would, no?  I imagine she just forgot to put the order in.  Just paid for our wine and left. Food looked good around us.  No, Duck Confit for me today :(  Weeeee."

Everything about our trip here was on point, from the charcuterie, the attentive service, and the black truffle pizza (definitely a highlight of the meal).   I also got the octopus dish here, and honestly, that was probably the only thing I regret getting as the octopus was unpleasantly soft and mushy.  The ambiance here was unmatched by any other place in Fredricksberg. I would definitely recommend coming here for a date night or just to hang out with friends before seeing the holiday lights."

If you don't have staff for that then at least put out a spiral notebook so people can write their own names down. Better yet let smaller parties place reservations."

                "description": "I was a bit concerned that Vaudeville would deliver on flavor but not portion but I was totally wrong! But first, lets talk about the ambiance. Fredericksburg is a beautiful and historic town with historic architecture. This quaint and snug dining establishment is underground, beneath an exquisite and unique boutique that carries rare items for the patron that delights in extremes, to say the least.  To get to the restaurant you need to go down a beautiful stairwell that gives off a modern-marries-vintage vibe. The oversized BISTRO sign is the first thing you see going down the stairs before you get to the hostess stand. The walls are lines with wine bottles and Fischer and Wiser sauces and spreads, and off to the side of that they have all their baked goods in a glass case.  We started off with the burrata which is served with a lovely salad and crusty bread, absolutely perfect. The asparagus were grilled to perfection, not too soft, not too firm, and they had a great flavor!  I wish I could order it as an entire side!  The Reuben was everything you would expect it to be. If you mess up a Reuben, you need to shut your doors or take it off the menu, and Vaudeville did it right!  Filled with pastrami, oozing melted gruyer cheese, and a Brussel sprout kraut, on marbled rye!  The sandwich is huge and even good reheated the next day.  We also had the roasted chicken sandwich which as absolutely devine! I was so impressed by the succulence of the chicken! Super moist and full of flavor. And the grilled mushrooms and fire roasted red peppers truly took it over the top.  For dessert we tried the white chocolate blackberry cashew cookie, which was the least impressive of the whole experience, the flavor was good, just not what I expected, but not enough for me to take away a star. It was very heavy and had more oats than blackberry, white chocolate, or cashew. It was very heavy and dense and I did not find that the ingredients were evenly distributed. The cookie was great when you got a bite of everything in one bite but there were only a few of those considering the size.   We are looking forward to going on a Friday to try the Lump Crab Coconut Curry though, we will definitely be back! And next time I am ordering the pistachio tiramisu for dessert! Overall, absolutely worth the trip."

Cute setting with a store upfront and the restaurant situated on the lower level. It had a great elegant vibe and I was impressed with the pretty diverse lunch menu !  I went with the Mediterranean plate which was delicious!! Cannellini bean purée, mixed olives , Baba Ganoush, roasted red peppers and a house made ricotta served with toasted bread! It was so delicious and full of flavor! Loved it.  Great food, service and setting! Cannot wait to bring my family here!"

                "description": "While in Fredericksburg celebrating our anniversary, my husband and I visited Vaudeville for a late lunch on the recommendation of friends. It was one of the highlights of our trip!   First off, Vaudeville is a super unique concept. It's a three-story establishment with the top floor being a free museum with an awesome second-story porch overlooking Main Street. A high-end gift boutique is at street level. Then the basement is a cozy yet lively little bistro with attentive service and fantastic fare.   Apparently, there is almost always a wait at the restaurant. We waited for about 40 minutes for a table even though it was after the lunch hour, but it went by quickly as we browsed the museum, observed the crowds below from the porch overhang, and shopped in the retail store.   Once seated, we ordered the cheese plate to start, which was life changing! The portions were generous and all the cheeses were spectacular. Each cheese was paired with jam and/or fruit that complemented the flavors. We were each given an assortment of crackers as well. We ate nearly the whole thing! So. Much. Cheese. And truly the best cheese tray we've ever had in terms of quality and selection. I ordered the Reuben and my husband ordered the French Dip. We liked both sandwiches but the Reuben was by far our favorite of the two. The marble rye was thick and crispy and the beef was very lean. The service was wonderful too; attentive and friendly but never smothering.   The only fault I could find with Vaudeville was in their bathrooms, of which there were only two unisex stalls. There was a constant line formed beside the two doors. The bathrooms themselves were not very clean or orderly, which didn't match Vaudeville's luxury brand as a whole. But this was still not enough of an issue to remove a star from an otherwise wonderful experience.   Bottom line: go to Vaudeville, preferably to eat, but don't forget to visit all three levels. And be sure to get that cheese plate!"

I almost wish I could have had a bigger stomach to try more things.   I ordered the rueben, which was amazing and big. I split this with my husband and we were both full/ satisfied when we were done.   FYI for those wanting to come here for the patio seating that was posted on Yelp, apparently that's part of the supper club. It was closed when we came so not sure how it is or when it's open but the pictures looked amazing. Instead we opted for the outside dining at the entrance of the restaurant.   Pro tip: if there is a wait, get on the list and go do a tasting at the cross mountain wine bar. By the time you know it your table will be ready ;)"

                "description": "Beautiful little bistro/restaurant on Main St. in Fredericksburg with a huge selection of wines. I think the best part of Vaudeville is their atmosphere; it's definitely more of an upscale vibe with dark wood and chic decor. Its located on the lower level of the building, so it can be a bit dark but that just adds to the charm and lets you feel like you have a bit more privacy with your table mates. The staff are very attentive and kind, and there's plenty of seating far apart to maintain social distancing.   As for the food, we came for lunch at around 12:30 on a weekday. We didn't have to wait at all, luckily. The food menu isn't very extensive, but they have some really good sandwich options and daily specials. We got the Tuesday special - crawfish etouffe - and the chicken sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious! The Crawfish Etouffe was a real hefty portion and had just a kick of spice to it; it was flavorful, filling, and hit just the right spot especially on a cold winter day. The Chicken sandwich was also fantastic; it came with chips, a pickle, and salad and is a very large portion, making for a great overall deal. The chicken was so tender, and I loved the olive marinade they used to give it a mediterrean flavor profile.   Overall, beautiful space with great lunch options. A little on the pricier side but worth it for the amtosphere."

I asked the Hostess how much longer and she tells me 15 minutes.  So,  all right we wait....30 more minutes. So I speak to someone else and I get the same reply (15 minutes and we are next). So we are all hungry (including my toddler son), so I ask again...in 15 minutes...I get the same answer. So I said we will just leave and not wait. The owner tells me \"with that attitude, you should leave\". So my wife asks how can you treat customers this way? To that,  he responds, \"it's my business,  I can do what I want\"."

The decor and ambiance was amazing, our waitress was amazing, but unfortunately I had to take a star out because our menus were all sticky and clearly wasn't cleaned. Other times I wouldn't really mind, however during COVID pandemic, I am more conscious about cleanliness.  The food was delicious! I got the duck confit special on a Tuesday and it's a must get!! All of the flavors were delicious and meshed well together. I would definitely recommend this dish. We then got the roasted chicken on 12 grain ciabatta and it was good as well! I would chose the duck confit over it though. Their caramel latte was nice and sweet, for those who like sweet drinks!"

The staff are friendly and wonderful. And most importantly the food is amazing! I would tell you I'm not a fan of pastrami and would never order a Reuben. That was before I had the Reuben here. It's possibly the best sandwich I've ever had in my life! Each bite is perfection! Homemade potato chips and a crispy spring salad compliment it perfectly. The meat and cheese boards are always delicious. And the short bread caramel cookie is heaven!!  On Sundays the fried chicken is available. I'm drooling just thinking of it!

The Fried chicken was juicy, and the krispy kale salad with bacon was cooked perfectly (just my personal taste that I don't like kale).  Only downside: Whipped potatoes were whipped too far to the point of being too runny, especially when gravy was added.  When the gravy was added to the potatoes, they didn't have enough consistency to be eaten with a fork.  Slightly firmer whipped potatoes would've made this a home run. The restaurant is in the basement, with a (luxury goods) store on the main level and art gallery on the  top floor."

                "description": "Betsy!  Thank you for your excellent service.  I learned a great deal about wine and really enjoyed the offerings here. They only offer grapes from outside TX, it seems most of their wines were from France or Italy. We liked that you could make your own tasting selections and that we were able to relax outdoors while the wines were brought out to us. I found the wine to be superior to most of the other wineries in the area. I will say from the street this place is very unassuming, we thought it was private residence and then saw a trailer with their brand and realized we had arrived. Bonus if you drive a Tesla- they do have a free plug and they waved us into driveway so we could charge! I was disappointed that both the cheese plate and the Grand Cru had sold out the night before at a member event. After drinking their other options, I bet their bubs are great!  Cheers AV!  Delicious!"

Depending on what your group's intentions are (tasting or purchasing bottles), you are seated either in the yard (tasting) or on the outskirts (bottles). Just a note: grapes are not grown on the vineyard, as it is imported from Europe, but that just means you can be a world traveler all in the luxury of staying in your seat. There's a nice after-taste to each sip with all the wines I tasted, love love love!"

Thank goodness we did because the wine is GREAT! It's not grown in Texas, or even the USA for that matter. It's from Europe but hand crafted (for the Alexander wine) by the owner and then shipped to the US. They do sell some other vineyards wines too from across Europe. We bought a ton from here and were super duper pleased with our purchases. Will definitely be coming again."

The owner is super nice and his wine steward Dayna is the bomb dignity! She was so knowledgeable in all the wine they import . In addition I had a great side conversation with her about life in general and she is just a gem! We s been coming to the town for about 2 years and stopping at all the same places ...this one just added to our list of permanent stops.

Sold out of any champagne unfortunately. A bit different than other wineries in the area, in that he's partnering with established european wine makers and rebranding wines from various regions. While that made for some nicely done wines, it was a bit off of a Texas wine experience.   It'll still be fun to see what styles of wines they have on future trips, and how they expand into more Texas sourced wine."

                "description": "We came by Alexander Vineyards after receiving multiple recommendations for a boutique winery that did red wines. It's kind of strange at first, because the tasting room is located in a house, but once you open the door, you see a modern tasting room. There are a few different small tasting bars perfect for a party of two to three people. It offers your group some privacy, yet you're never too far away from others who are also indulging in wine. There are two winery dogs that love to be pet. I went to take a picture of one and he gave me this look like \"you really just want to take my picture and not pet me?\" The dogs are really easy going and usually just find a place to plop down and take a little nap until something exciting catches their eyes.   The day we were there only one champagne was available for tasting, but not even available for purchase. It was kind of a let down since we had really wanted to start our first winery of the day with bubbles. This is the only winery in the area that does not source local grapes. All of the grapes come from France and that is why they can call their champagne, champagne instead of sparkling wine. They also paired a few of our wines with cheese and chocolates. It was a really nice touch. We weren't huge fans of the wines on their owns, but once paired, we were impressed."

The tasting room is quaint and unassuming, but the wine will blow you away.  The tastings were paired with amazing blue cheese, olive oil,  and chocolate and it was just so delightful how well they went together, and really changed or brought up different flavors in the wines.  And the lady who did our tasting, I think her name was Dana? Was insanely knowledgeable about the different wine regions, vines and their ages, and just really taught us so much throughout the tasting.  I highly highly recommend this place!!!

There's a few tables inside and you can enjoy a glass of wine at the bar or take a bottle out to there secondary patio area, if you don't have reservations and they are booked up.  There's a wrap around main patio with various seating options outdoors for reservations.  Although there is a couple resident winery dogs, they no longer allow dogs on the weekends, or children.  | Wine |  They have some lovely wines.  I prefer their whites vs. their reds, but there are good ones for both.  They probably do blends the best, so it's good to do their wine tasting if it's your first visit.  I really like their Marsanne and they make a really nice Rose.  | Food |  The charcuterie plate is one of the best and is chock full of great meats, cheeses, and fruits.  It tastes a good as it looks!"

We always buy 2 to 3 bottles, enjoying one on their patio (we just can't help ourselves) overlooking their vineyard and some spectacular views of the Texas hill country. Only drawback is they don't allow you to bring your own snacks. The staff is professional, accommodating, and nice. We generally get a small sample of each wine before we have to commit to a bottle.

My family and I went with the $15 sampler (meant to be for 5 wines but our server let us taste all the wine on the list) Our wine server was extremely friendly and told us a lot of the wine we were drinking. Every wine we had was very delicious! My personal favorites were the Dreamchaser Blanc and Dreamchaser (Merlot), both of which were reasonably sweet but also fragrant and floral. We ended up buying a few bottles (which also allowed us to comp 2 of our samplings!).  Regarding the overall ambience, the winery is beautiful, even in winter when the trees have lost color. While Narrow Path also has a tasting room in downtown Fredericksburg, I would highly suggest going to their actual winery where the tasting room gives you both the comfort of home and the classiness of a lounge. I would love to go when the weather is nicer to take advantage of their plethora of outdoor seating.  I certainly plan on going here again!"

                "description": "Narrow Path was our second stop for wine on Main Street. For $14 you get the choice of 5 wines and you get to keep the tasting glass. Our server couldn't have been nicer. She explained each of the wines we chose and was very friendly. I tried the sauvignon blanc 2013, the viognier 2014, the malbec 2012, the texas select red 2013, and the syrah 2013. The sauvignon blanc was a bit too crisp for my taste, and the viognier tasted watered down. The malbec was just ok, and my favorite was probably the texas select red. It was very earthy. The syrah was very typical for a syrah, but I'm not really a syrah drinker so perhaps I shouldn't judge. The tasting room is pretty small with three small tables and a tasting bar. However it's still welcoming, but just gets crowded quickly."

                "description": "Narrow Path Winery is owned by the Turbeville family who has been involved in the wine industry since 2002.  They source the grapes for their wine from TX and California.  You can select a choice of 5 wines from their tasting menu for $14, and keep the complimentary glass.  The tasting room itself is quaint.  It is narrow, and small, but they have done nice things with the space. There are one or two tables tucked away in the corners that you can sit at to enjoy a glass of wine.  The bottle prices are in the lower range when compared with the neighboring Texas wineries.  The wines we had were well structured and approachable. They are ready to drink now.  The wine here was decent.  The tasting room associate was interesting. He was knowledgeable about the wine, but his interactions with us were awkward. You could tell that this wasn't his passion in life.  He had some very unique opinions about the Texas wine industry and those in it."

For $25 you get 5 tastings and a \"snack\" - the options were a lunchable or a wood fired pizza...how is this even a choice? The pizza is to share with 1 other person but very big and the perfect amount of food to soak up the wine.   The wines. All from Italy and just amazing. There are many whites and reds, sweet, dry, bubbly. The sommelier was lots of fun, knows a ton about the wines and seemingly loves what he does! We had a huge group of 14 ladies and they made accomodations for us. My favorite wines were pretty pricey but there was a range of price points available."

It's a neat place filled with nice Italian wines."

Cross Mountain wines are fully produced and bottled in Italy to the owner's specs and imported here for sale. None of the wines are made from Texas grapes. I tasted a series of reds, which were all of top quality.  As we relaxed with our second glass of wine, people began coming in and ordering wines by the glass. They all clearly knew each other well. I asked our hosts if these were local shop keepers coming in after closing for the day. He said no, these are retirees who go from winery to winery enjoying their complimentary wine club glass of wine. \"They come here last because we are open the latest.\"  Hmmmmm. No that would suit me just fine!"

                "description": "I've been to Fredericksburg many times to do wine tours and tastings, and this may possibly be my new favorite! All of their wines are Italian, which means that their grapes are grown mountain-side. This gives the wines a different flavor than most of the other wines you can find in Fredericksburg, so it's a nice change from the other vineyards. The tastings are around $25, and you get to try 5! The staff are all very fun and engaging, and they also have great pizza and charcuterie boards to go along with your tastings. I would recommend the Amarone (dry red) and the Fior D'arancio (sweet sparkling). We will definitely be back for more wine soon!"

The rare, the common, the unique, they have it all and know it well. Really cool bar area up front with shop stuff to buy. Seated about 15 or so. The backroom has tables for about 30 more. The wine menu listed every wine they have and they cross off those they are out of so you know what's available before you order. They do flights of 5, by the glass, wine to go, and bottles. Not since I lived in Italy did I have the 5 wines I picked out on my visit. The bar staff are also way fun people let me tell you. Great place to stop and wine taste right in downtown. The Amarone is a must-try Italian red wine!"

We decided, it would be the next stop on our tour. Well it is a great spot if you are not black or Hispanic. We walked in and were never greeted. Finally, when I THOUGHT I had gained the attention of whom I believe was one of the owners, she looked right at me and ignored me as she greeted three white ladies that were behind us. When someone else helped us, she acted as if it was putting her in distress to even talk to me or explain how the seating worked. She actually explained the whole process to ANOTHER group of ladies that were behind us instead of talking to us. When she decided to talk to us again, I mentioned that it was five of us and she says \"it's more of yall?\" and we were told that  we would be brought the glasses. No one ever came by our table. FINALLY, after sitting there for 10 minutes with no help, a older man came by but not to our table. He walked to a table of other ladies, asking them if they had been helped. He then  looked right at us and left the area without ever asking us if we needed anything OR if we had had been helped already.We decided to leave because it was very clear our kind was not wanted. I would also like to mention that it was NOT busy!"

We were able to get a table without having a reservation (but I see where one would be helpful). Our waiter was very knowledgeable on their wine selection. We did a tasting and it was nice because they had the tastings sorted by taste so you just told them what you liked and they had a list already made. We didn't feel rushed or anything and the waiter was very talkative, but in a good way! Constantly making us laugh! Very enjoyable and we will definitely be back! We even bought a couple bottles for later on! There is a boutique style store also for shopping and souvenirs. Beautiful building and grounds and a must for anyone visiting Fredericksburg!! You can't miss it, there's huge flags flying by the road and a mannequin waving a sign!"

Hailey took excellent care of us - good service, a great sense of humor, good recommendations too! In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have started there, as we spent the rest of the trip comparing everything to Bingham, but it was definitely a highlight. The different tasting menus available were great, as you can get only reds or whites or sweet wines depending on personal tastes. The charcuterie board had some really nice touches - the honey stick went great with the goat cheese. And the oyster crackers are amazing. They sell them in bags if you, like us, just could not get enough of them. The location is good too, a beautiful tasting room, high ceilings and and a very eye catching chandelier."

We were happy with the quality of the wine that is available at this location, many have won awards across Texas and even in California. This is the only reason I give this place 3 stars.   The service was lackluster. We had to stand and wait for our appointment, which wouldn't be a worry if the staff actually was preparing for us. After 15 minutes of waiting where they told us to, they only pulled out 2 clean wine glasses and a cup of crackers. Nothing additional was offered. The staff only came by to pour us our next sip of wine, which was never prompt. Minimal interaction or information about the wines and vineyard was given. This of course was very disappointing. Completely lacking of the complete wine tasting experience that is available at dozens of wineries in the area."

We didn't want to do a tasting, just wanted to buy a couple bottles of wine and sit down. They found us a table inside the main room and were very helpful in what to order. We tried Dugout and absolutely loved it! We took a bottle to go and then I ended up joining the wine club a month later to get more! This is my new favorite stop when visiting Fredericksburg! Make sure to check out the store next door, the prices are reasonable!"

When we first arrived we were the only tasters therefore felt a little overwhelmed w staff. We had one person helping us and he did excellent, but felt as if the manager person was \"watching\" over our shoulder or standing close. Couldn't tell if he wanted to chat or had something else going on.   Tasting was good and they have water and taste bud sweet cracker balls. Wines were good and different....great club wine deals and options...  Shop next door is really neat and fun to explore!   Would recommend and return."

                "description": "Bingham is certainly no stranger to the Texas wine industry. Having supplied many wineries with their quality grapes, it is not uncommon to see Bingham as the source vineyard on Texas wine labels. This multigenerational family has roots in Texas farming that goes back to the early 1900s. Cotton, peanuts, black-eyed peas, and sesame seeds have and continue to be part of their agricultural heritage. They started the process in the 1990s to be certified organic. In 2003 they planted their first grapevines of Viognier and Gewürztraminer. That has since grown to over 200 acres of 25+ varieties of grapes. About seventy five percent of their grape harvest goes to various wineries throughout Texas. It is interesting to see how different winemakers at wineries make their wine, even with the same source and vintage, ultimately still tasting uniquely their own, which is a nod to the ever-diverse creativity going on among wineries. Bingham Vineyards keeps about 10% of the grape harvest for their own wine production, with the rest going out for sale as bulk wine. Wine production is kept small to craft quality boutique wines. They made their first Bingham bottle in 2014 and in 2015 they opened a tasting room in Grapevine, Texas. In 2018, they opened another tasting room on the eastern outskirts of Fredericksburg. We visited the Fredericksburg location and were quite impressed with both the rustic decor and the wines. A lot of reclaimed wood was used in the building construction and with the high ceilings it gives a more inviting and relaxed feel. So, what about their estate wines? Well, they do have an impressive selection that you can choose from. Pick your favorite flight style and you cannot go wrong. There is literally something for everyone here. For the white wine flight, we started off with the 2019 Trebbiano. The citrus and lemon notes along with light acids really highlighted some of the best flavors of this wine. Roussanne has certainly been making a great strong showing in Texas white wines. Their 2019 vintage has that rich feel and balanced acids that will make you love this sipper. But wait! There is also a 2018 Reserve Roussanne that you must try. With a touch of oak and good vanilla notes combined with that rich, full mouthfeel, we think you might fall in love with this one. Many long time Texas wine fans know how Viognier helped make a strong showing for Texas whites and their 2019 wine is right on the mark. It is a bit softer than some other Texas Viogniers, with a light creaminess. We can see why this 2020 San Francisco Viognier winner stood out. Marsanne is another up and coming white wine in the state and their 2019 release has just the right floral notes combined with the flavors of lemon and pineapple. Texas Roséwines are also seeing increased interest over the last few years and their 2019 Sunset Roséis no exception. Made from Mourvèdre and Carignan, this smooth drinking Roséis a great Texas chiller to refresh your palate with on warm summer days. You will be equally pleased with their reds and the 2018 Turnrow is a great starter. Made with Mourvèdre, Dolcetto, Carignan, and Tempranillo, you might be asking where is that artisan pizza at to pair with it. Like Carignan? They have great 2018 vintage that is both smooth with a hint of spice. Tempranillo is certainly the \"big\" red grape that helped put Texas on the wine map and their 2018 release is on par with good Texas Temps. It is full bodied with lots of rich plums to envelope your palate. Their 2017 reserve Tempranillio as some earthy undertones, is rich in blackberry fruit and has a great long finish. The single varietal 2018 Dolcettois bold with big intense fruit aromas. They also have a good Bordeaux style blend made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot. This 2017 Bordeaux style blend called Dugout, named after their family's original homestead heritage, is quite well balanced, has a smooth feel, rich berries, moderate acids, and a good lingering finish. It made a great showing at the 2020 San Francisco as a gold medal winner! For the sweets, do checkout the 2019 Moscato Giallo It has just the right lushness on the nose and that silky, citrus feel that puts the yum in every drop. You should not leave without trying the Fine 'n Dandy sweet red. As a nod to Eddie Bingham, this light red wine has some pecan flavors to it for that added delight. This is a great tasting room to visit. The staff will make you feel warm and welcomed. Additionally, the team in the tasting room are quite knowledgeable and will even have some excellent pairing suggestions. The price points on the wines are quite affordable, so stock up. Visit, stay, and enjoy!"

Texas Heritage Vineyard started planting their vines in 2015 and opened the tasting room on Highway 290 in 2018. As we see with all young wineries across the globe, it takes time to evolve into the style of wines that fit the vision of the winery and the Johnson family has done a great job. Today we spent a little time with daughter Jessica and their winemaker, Tyler, and could really feel the sense of style as we tasted through their current wines. Of particular note is the current Lizzie Rose, which is sporting a lovely new label this vintage. And the Souza was bold but smooth and quite nicely balanced. Their tastings are now hosted outside and we were blessed with a beautiful day that enhanced the tasting. Add these guys to your list the next time you're tasting in the hill country!"

They make you feel like you belong there and not just the next person to come in and out. Sitting on the back patio with a fire or listening to live music is my favorite too!"

The space has a lot of potential. It would have been nice to have had some background music (CandW or jazz) rather than ESPN blaring from the corner of the room. I'm used to seeing that at a sports bar, not a tasting room. The patio was beautiful if you kept you vision straight out- would be nice to somehow screen out the properties on either side.  One last thing- the front faces 290- put blinds on the front windows to block out the constant traffic. This place has so much potential- I hope they succeed!"

                "description": "Downtown Fredericksburg can be a crowded place on weekends with wineries, shops, and food galore.  Just before you get to this \"bustling\" tourist town, there is a great new winery that's much easier to get in and out of than a parking spot on main street!  The owners, Billy and Susan Johnson, established their dream venture in 2015 with their first vine plantings of Tempranillo and Tannat which has since expanded to Alicante Bouschet, Malbec, Souzao, and Viognier. They opened their tasting room on highway 290 to the public last May.  Since then, they have gotten the fast lesson on what it is like to be a new winery that everyone wants to visit. Being busy is good for business and they have quite a selection of 100% Texas wines to share with thirsty customers.  The inside of their tasting room is quite spacious with a bar and ample seating. However, the real treat is on the back porch where you will get a fabulous view of the rolling hills on the southside terrain that you would never suspect to see.  The vineyard is separate from their tasting room and is located about 10 miles south of there on Grapetown road where wine club pickup events will be held. John Rivenburgh has been helping the Johnsons out with their initial wine production. In addition to their estate vineyard, they also source about 400 tons from Brownfield.  Their current tasting selection consists of a good mix of white and red wines along with a Rose' to round out the lot. The first white we tasted was the 2017 Malvasia Bianca. It is quite floral with a soft finish. The other white to try is the 2017 Roussanne with pronounced pineapple notes and quite a long finish.  The 2017 Lizzie Rose' is a special family treat. Named after Susan's Great-Grandmother, this 85% Grenache Rose' has lingering strawberry notes with moderate acidity. For the reds, the 2016 Malbec is quite fruit forward with a touch of leather.  The 2016 Dolcetto is a low tannin red that is soft and easy to sip. For their 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon, you will detect leather and licorice notes. For the wine that has helped put Texas on the map, their 2016 Tempranillo does justice.  It's full of flavor with a touch of boldness and silky lingering tannins that begs to be paired with a nice Texas ribeye. In the coming months they will be releasing their 2017 Texas Cabernet Sauvignon.  It promises to be a great vintage! This will be followed by a Petite Sirah, Souzao, Trebbiano, and Tannat.  With live music every Saturday and Sunday and a great staff to chat and visit with when you stop in, you'll be a happy camper here every weekend.  Drop on by and check them out, we do not think you will be disappointed. Enjoy!"

We were sat in the front room - 2 comfy chairs and a little table for drinks. There was another family of 3 on the large couch but for the close quarters we still couldn't hear each others conversations, which was nice.  We were served promptly and they gave a great explanation of the wines we were sampling and the little snacks they provided to pair them with. They checked back on us as we worked through the flights and enjoyed some small talk. We walked away happy and with a couple of bottles.  We'll save this place as a favorite to stop back the next time we visit Fredericksburg."

Her two staff members I spoke to during my Texas Red tasting flight were all-stars, Taryh and Shanae, both way cool gals you got to ask for if you come here, trust me on that. This rustic old house/cabin structure is a throwback to a previous era and I loved the vibe it gives off. Mellow, chill, relaxing, comforting, all in one place. I approve of all 3 wines I tried here but the big standout for me was the Hilmy Cellars Cab Sauvignon."

Their tasting walks you through 3 wines of a certain varietal. There is 1 Texas wine and 2 others from a different region. It's so much fun to compare the differences between each region. Very helpful if you want to learn more about wine! Also, their space is beautiful and so cozy. I could have sat there for hours drinking wine. They also offer wines by the glass and bottle. We will definitely be back on a future trip."

We were all excited to try them, but what arrived was a very sour lemon elderberry, peach, and a very syrup heavy (like cough syrup) pomegranate. We asked for dry champagne instead of sweet, but all of the drinks were extremely sweet and flat. They either forgot to add the bubbly or it was sitting out all day. We paid $80+ tip for four people to be disappointed. We all agreed they were the worst mimosas we've ever had. We would not go back."

These tastings also come with a little nibble for each glass. They also offer cheese/charcuterie plates and full glasses. We just thought the tastings were so unique. And the woman who owned the place was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. We ended up going back to back days during our visit!"

The interior looked really nice and cozy and the concept of trying three different wines from Texas , new world and old world was very intriguing. However we were pretty disappointed. A man doing the tasting had us sit down and explained the options - after we picked the grape varietal we wanted he got up and prepared it with a little tray of \"pairings\" aka 5 stale almonds/jerky/figs. Then he realized he got us the wrong flight of wines! Making us feel flustered and like we had to accept that one instead of the one we wanted. It was awkward. He then prepared the correct flight and has us taste them while he sat across from us with his laptop and a huge jug of water and his left over whattaburger lunch. The wine was mediocre at best - almost tasted as tho it had been sitting out and \"breathing\" just a little too long  The kicker on this whole experience was that his friends came in the middle! Walked in and started chatting - and then right in front of us the man goes - oh I accenditely poured the wrong wines why don't you guys take these?!\"   Saw this as moderately rude considering the flights were pricey for a tiny taste and the establishment was trying to pull off a classy vibe. Very biazzare. It wasn't our fault he poured the wrong flight but to offer it your buddies right in front us just put an even worse taste in our palates."

We tried Pinot and Tempranillo and throughly enjoyed a relaxing tasting in a comfortable fun place. Had a chance to visit with the owner, so pleasant. If we're ever in this part of Texas again would absolutely do it again."

We sat in the front room with a couch and a few chairs. There were six of us and it was perfect. We all ordered different wines and they bring a small board with different foods to go with the flavors. The wines were explained to us in detail and we were left to enjoy our time with our friends. We got a little rowdy but they were super nice about it and glad we were having a good time. You really need to add it to your stops when you are here to just relax and enjoy some wine and good conversation."

There is a reason Vintners has 5 stars fr all of the reviews. We walked in and were greeted by Dana. Dana took us on a journey through wine! She was friendly and taught me more about wine in an hourish than I'd learned in years.  I just drank it occasionally.  I'm going to keep this review short and sweet (like some of the wine we tried). We loved this place. We loved the atmosphere, the staff and the wine. Try it out! Cheers!"

                "description": "This little gem is a must-visit when you're in downtown Fredericksburg. The small tasting room is made to feel spacious with a high ceiling and comfortable seating. Guests can sit at the bar for a highly interactive tasting with folks who truly love the Texas wine industry. Or, relax at your own table inside or out on the sunny patio. What makes this spot unique is they represent 6 to 8 small boutique wineries that are producing 100% Texas wines in small batches. Some of these winemakers don't even have their own tasting room. The tasting room is owned by a local family, who are also grape growers and know the intimate details of wine in the Hill Country. The menu changes since the wines are limited production, and currently they offer 6 tastings of 1oz pours which you choose from a list of about 16 wines. What a great way to get a nice overview of what's possible in our state! The wine pourers are always helpful and can guide you in what wines you may enjoy most, based on your personal preferences. Plus, nearly every time you come in, there is something new on the list for you to try. It's also a good stop if you want a nice cheese and charcuterie board for lunch or an afternoon snack. Whether your a visitor or a local, this should be on your list when you get out for wine tasting in Fredericksburg!"

The charcuterie board, which also had the owners wife's homemade wine jelly on it and delectable pecan onion bread made locally, was incredible. This was easily my husband and I's favorite spot the entire visit. We were welcomed from the moment we walked in and felt like we were family.

You don't get this personal attention at other larger wineries in Fredericksburg.  She has informed us that the first membership club is closed, however she just opened up a second club membership with different perks.  I will probably switch my current membership there to the newer club.  They don't keep a large stock, so you need to get yours while you can, because once it is gone, there are no more of that particular wine.  We love this place and would give it more Stars if we could.  These people know how to make their members feel appreciated."

I even asked why they named it FW as usually wineries tend to have a story and so you fall in love with the wine and the roots. She actually said \"I don't know\", k?!?! I asked for military discount and she said she didn't know and so eventually came back and said no on the tasting. I had a 15% on Yelp for checking in which I asked her to use, again just on the merchandise.  Ugh?!? Okay well fine. Very impersonal, my least favorite wine stop."

Let's start with the way they greeted you has you entered, It was like they were waiting for you, so off to a wine tasting section we went. Our wine goddess ( what else do you call someone who brings you wine and pours it)  was great and really knew the wines . I am a red wine girl and the hubby prefers dessert and port. Well o tasted a lot , feeling pretty good right now. Hubby did the dessert wines and ended up buying a few has did I. I bought a few bottles myself and got a glass of the rhinestone cowgirl.  Which is a Malbec and pinot Grigio. It was sweet but not overly sweet.  So I went to buy another glass why we sat in the court yard listening to music and ended up says oh well buy the bottle.   I will say the staff made this memorable for me. They had fun with the wine tasting the genuine love of the job showed through."

                "description": "It is a cute little tasting room, but they are in desperate need of staff. We went on a weekday when the weather was terrible (40s and rain), so it was definitely \"off season,\" yet the place was crowded. There were two people working, but for a long stretch only the man behind the counter was helping any of the customers. We suspected the woman working didn't have authority to pour, but she ended up pouring for two ladies that came in next to us. They got perfect, attentive service, as she only served them, despite there being roughly 20 people up and down the bar, the other 18 under the care of the single other salesman, who looked visibly overworked and taxed.  He was friendly enough, but it was clear he was just  giving his typical speech before he sped on to someone else. The customer service (or lack thereof) definitely took something away from the experience. I got very little time with the man pouring, so it was hard to ask questions. Then, there were long pauses between pours. All in all, they need to work on their staffing.   The wines range across the board, from dry to sweet, but I noticed that even the \"semi-sweet\" wine I tried was pretty sweet for a wine. (I can't imagine the far end of the spectrum.) The sauvignon blanc was described to taste like a pina colada, which it kind of did... more like a melted pina colada slushie. I think it was very hit or miss. That said, there was one wine that knocked my socks off - their merlot is incredible! It is a bit on the pricier end, but it is a really delicious merlot with a cherry nose and finish, which was really pleasant to drink.   They offer a free glass with your tasting, which is nice, but contrary to every wine tasting I've done (and I confess to have done a lot in several states and even internationally), they only waive the tasting fee with the purchase of THREE bottles! So, if you want just one bottle and a tasting, that could run you $50 with the tip added in. The merlot maybe deserved that, but not when  combined with everything else going on, unfortunately.   Also, take heed they do not have bathrooms, even for patrons. I know that upset some people."

We did have our address changed at the post office and all mail should have been forwarded to the new address.  However, come time I got an email stating our wine had been delivered I called Fiesta winery and they searched for the wine.  Their delivery driver delivered the wine without signature at our old address.  Left alcohol at someone else's house.  In which Fiesta winery said he wasn't supposed to do.  And instead of trying to make it right with us as a member, they said it was on me to locate it and change my address.  It should have been returned to sender and then contact me by email or phone I feel.  Well they lost a member and paying customers.   We loved the wine but is what it is.  Hate it but Plenty of other choices."

                "description": "Excellent wine tasting room on Fredericksburg's main street.  As of January 2017, it's $12 for a 6-sample tasting flight, and it's a great value when one considers that you also get to keep the glass.  (It's a non-stem glass, but I think those are great for drinkers who may be a little on the tipsy side.)    Service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Also, I like their setup: they split the wine list into two suggested grouping: white (and generally sweet), as well as red (and generally dry). Sweetness increases as you work from top to bottom.  If you're not sure how sweet you like your wine, pick something from the middle, for example the Roussanne for the white, Cabernet for the red.  Depending on your reaction, work 'up' or 'down' the list from there.  Alas, when we visited the famous 'Lime in the Coconut' was out, but all the whites we tried ran the gamut from 'pretty good' to 'outstanding'.  Of special merit was the 'Happy Trails' Chardonnay, which has such a magnificent peach bouquet that one could practically smell the fuzz!  Definitely worth a visit here if you can't make it to their winery on 290 on the way to F'burg."

Wine tasting is $10 for 5 pours and includes a cute stemless FWF wine glass.Also, live music every Saturday from 2-5pm.   All of their wines are inherently on the sweet side. I was told it is a direct intention of the husband and wife owners. I have to be honest and say they weren't my favorite. Perhaps they are more suited for people who are just starting to drink wine.   On a side note, Chocolat in Fredericksburg makes special wine filled, sugar coated candies specially for FWF. Sounds a bit strange, but they are amazing! The chocolates pair perfectly with the wineries sweet wines. They can only be purchased at the winery, so be sure to buy a box for yourself and maybe one for a gift...just try not to eat both before you have a chance to give one away. :)  Wine=3 stars. 1 extra star for the fantastic service (some of the best out of all the wineries), live music, chocolates, and all around laid back atmosphere!"

The experience was hectic at first with the customer service due to an upcoming wedding they were setting up.   A sommelier named Louis was not shy to jump in and provide us with beyond exceptional service, even after last pour was called. He made our experience comfortable and personal as the group of us were taste testing 5 selected wines; white, rose, and reds. His knowledge on the history of each bottle and the fermentation process was impressive. I can not express enough how grateful I was for his service and how wonderful the atmosphere was.   The owner greeted our table and every other table, which I was pleased with. He helped bus tables which indicated his passion for being a part of his team. He spoke highly of Louis which says a lot about how important his presence meant to him.   A beautiful property with an impressive view, open floor layout, and affordability was good. This is the place to attend for all the locals and out of town guests.   Reserve ahead of time and ask for Louis the next time you are passing through for a wonderful service and a bite to eat."

                "description": "This is for the Edge Tasting Room featuring English Newsome Cellars. We are currently in town celebrating my bachelorette party. The limo service we hired decided to make this a stop for our group.   We were quickly sat as a group of 9 thankfully through that service. The driver had been there enough times already although they've only been open a month to have a connection with one of the employees. Sadly this was not the person taking care of us.   The girl we were placed with sadly took away from our experience at this winery to the point where we had to complain due to her not explaining anything about the wines beyond the first. She would also not get our entire group with each pour.   The management when they became aware of the issue was more than willing to talk with us and wanted to make up for the poor service. They were super friendly.   The back patio was awesome. Beautiful view of the river which is only going to get better. They have a small putting green you are able to use while enjoying a glass. Perfect date vibes.   The food was also pretty good. The nachos were good even with the olives. Plenty of flavor. My ladies loved the bleu cheese dip wanting more of it. I can't say anything about the actual meals since I never got mine.   I realize that my group along with the other bachelorette party we spoke to both had bad experiences with the one employee. However the other portions of the experience were good. The temperitto was my favorite by far."

                "description": "This review is for The Edge tasting room.  My wife, daughter (9 yrs old), and I came on the grand opening day.  (It should be noted the back is still under construction) While navigating to the business it was difficult to find.  Turns out you have to turn in at the Tiny Houses and go to the back.  The building is beautiful and the grounds are awesome.  A beautiful view of the river from the back.    While relaxing in the back of the resort we ordered food.  The food was great and was pretty fast.  Servers were very attentive and polite.    Wine:  according to my wife who has had wine all over the world it was pretty good.  She ordered a second glass so I believe her.  I personally didn't taste it as I think wine is a waste of grapes.  I did however order an iced tea.  It was pretty good and tasted just like iced tea.  Price:  Food was reasonably priced.  Wine was a little expensive for what you get.  You can expect that from any place that has pour lines on their glasses though.  If you are worried about the price maybe you should consider buying boxed wine and going to the park instead of coming here.    CONS/RECOMMENDATIONS:  This is Texas.  We drink tea with sugar.  Get rid of the California tea.  Also, put the tasting notes on the tasting menu.  If you are in the Fredericksburg area you should stop in."

                "description": "Such a good experience at Fiesta Winery 290. First, it was such a good price. $15 for wine tasting and a complimentary glass and our server, Gaynell, was such a hoot. She was friendly, charming and funny. I definitely felt that warm Texas welcome from her. I look forward to ordering some wine from their website because it was just that good.   When I come back to Austin, I definitely will make the drive to this place again."

I've been with a girlfriend before and had a different vibe.  Not much of food options and no food truck the day we went.  So we give 4 star cause not much of food provisions and the wine was just ok this last time."

Of the places visited today, this was the one awful experience, the only one actually. It also takes me a lot to leave a negative review because I understand people have bad days, but we had 9 people all ready to order wine, and we all walked out due to her disrespectful attitude. Rolling eyes, clinching fists, etc. it was so bad it's almost funny."

I think $20 per tasting is too high though. We are not in Napa Valley! However, if you buy 3 bottles, the tasting fee is waived. I appreciate that. Their wine bottle pricing is very good. Will go back and buy 3 bottles next time! Our server was outstanding!"

All the choices were delicious too, and very reasonable. I would highly recommend this winery and I will be back! Thank you!"

                "description": "This was defiantly not a party at Fiesta. We arrive half an hour before closing and we're treated like we had imposed on them rather than an opportunity to make a sale. We then were ushered to the tasing room offered no help  selecting a wine. When we finally chose one it was poured into a plastic cup. We knew we were  unwanted and left to sit outside where we saw the other couple left there drinking from glasses. Very disappointed and will never return."

They have a cute outside seating area for when the weather is nice and a fairly large inside/bar area for all the space for your wine drinking needs. Quirky, helpful \"winetenders\" who would love to chat with you if they aren't too busy with other costumers are always there. If you do their wine tasting for $15/pp, you get to take home a souvenir wine glass which is really a steal!   Pay a visit if you are a wine newbie, Like I said this place cater more to sweet wine palates :)"

GayNell had superb customer service skills and set the tone for a fun, relaxed, enjoyable experience. If you're in town, you have to stop by for a wine tasting, some dark chocolate, and the perfect meat and cheese charchuterie platter. You will not be disappointed!!!!! I love you Gaynell, from your favorite Gemini!"

                "description": "They definitely were trying their best, but only two employees for everyone on a fairly busy afternoon made things pretty hectic. This also meant all the tastings had to be inside, which wasn't really what we wanted during COVID. They do have a nice outdoor patio but you can only use that if you are just having a glass/bottle.  The wines were a bit too sweet for my taste on a whole, but some of the drier ones I enjoyed. On the cheaper side too which is a plus."

That sounds pretty standard for the wineries in the area but Fiesta was a great place to go to right along the highway!

With so many wines and goodness to choose from, it's a wonder people make it out of here with less than a case to take home. Now, again, I'm Preggo...so there wasn't any heavy tasting going on. However, when my girls were tasting a margarita wine, I had to have a sip. (Don't at me bro, this is baby number 3, I'm Gucci) The small sip I took had me sitting on my back porch watching my babies play in the summer. This wine was good! So I purchased a bottle for after baby gets here. The ladies behind the bar told me how to store it for 7 months and were super sweet and helpful as I asked so many questions. I had a favorite winery here, but needless to say, this place got them beat this time around."

                "description": "My boyfriend and discuss our not-so-hot experiences as being either a.) passively unimpressive or b.) actively bad. Meaning either a.) they didn't seem to give a shit or b.) someone was aiming to piss in our Wheaties (very rare). Fiesta Winery happened to fall in the 'A' category: passively unimpressive (which is most often the result of lackluster service). Unfortunately, the young gentleman behind the counter had no interest in sharing any information with us about the vineyard or wines themselves. We would ask a question and his response would be somewhat perturbed and lacked any real information. My best winery and tasting experiences have occurred when the employees are enthusiastic about the product and eager to make the customer equally excited about their vineyard and wine.   The buildings that make up Fiesta Winery (and a few other tasting rooms) are very charming and located along the scenic 290 wine route. The Fiesta tasting room was very spacious and looked like it would be a good stop for bachelorette parties. The wine itself was okay. A little sweet for my liking. The rhinestone cowgirl tasted exactly what it sounds like - - sweet and strawberry-ish and interesting....  I think if we had a different server at the bar our whole experience would have been much more favorable. Here's to hoping he realizes the power of a smile. (bigger tips, yo!)"

                "description": "So much to say about Fiesta Winery! As the first winery I ever visited, it will forever hold a special place in my heart. It also happens to be the first winer where I joined a Wine Club. The vibes and all around atmosphere at Fiesta are always so welcoming and happy! It really does feel like home when you're here. The staff, no matter who it is, what day it is, what time it is, always go above and beyond to ensure you feel like family. Becoming a part of the Fiesta Family was one of the best decisions I have ever made and I LIVE to stop by and do a tasting, no matter how many times I've had the wines.   Now for the recommendations! If you're looking for a nice, sweet red, I recommend Texas Summer Nights. This wine is sweet, without being TOO sweet, all while keeping the body of a true red. For a sweet blush, Savannah Rose hits the spot. It's very fruit-forward and has a strong strawberry flavor! Another sensational sweet blush is Rhinestone Cowgirl!   If I could change one thing about Fiesta, it's that I would be able to fake a Fiesta Family wine glass home with me to add to my collection."

You are allowed to go in and out of the tasting room though, so still a spot I'd recommend on the day you bring the pup.)  Cody served our wine tasting - he was solid and very tolerant of all the back and forth.  I did feel as though their mid and sweeter wines were better than their dry wines. Might have just been the weekend, but I also preferred their blush wines to their reds. True to (my usual) form, I could have passed on the whites. Unlike my friend, I was the child who couldn't follow directions and just circle six, so I ended  up circling 12 and doing 2 tastings (and received 2 glasses for it)."

You will love all of their offerings.... I promise! They also have some very nice merchandise, like witty wine glasses and goat milk soaps. Honestly, their logo is just so cool a tshirt or hat would be awesome too. So happy we popped in here!"

Make sure to ask for Barb when you are visiting this establishment. She will lead you in the right direction with what to taste and make sure you are enjoying yourself.   The wine selection ranges from sweet to dry. Everyone will find something they would like to try. Also, I would recommend getting the cheese board. The service is quick and the food is a high point of the visit."

                "description": "Six Shooters is a tasting room offering wines from 6 Texas wineries. According to one of the staff members you would have to travel 1,200 miles to visit each of the wineries, so save some gas and still get a unique experience at their tasting room. They opened on May 24th 2013 showcasing wines from Cowtown Winery, Clear Creek Vineyards, Yepez Vineyard, Cross Timbers Winery and Retreat Hill. The six shooter will be Blazing Barrels but they are still working on getting their bottles in the tasting room. The building reeks of history as it is located in a historical school and they relocated an 1800s Kentucky tobacco bar inside the center of the building.  The tasting room is next door to The Pink Pig restaurant and the newly opened Fiesta Winery tasting room off of 290. Wine tastings are $10 for 6 pours and you can keep the glass. Honestly I burn out on Texas wines pretty easily but their wines, especially the reds, are excellent. I tried Cowtown Republic Red, Cross Timber Tempranillo, Clear Creek Reserve Zinfandel, Yepez Gran Mezcla and Black Bart Blackberry infused wine. I liked all the reds (5 out of the 6 wines tasted). The Tempranillo was light, the Zinfandel bold and spicy, the Republic Red a decent Malbec and the Gran Mezcla unique. The blackberry infused wine was not too sweet and reminded me of wines you would find in Door County, WI. We bought a bottle of the Zinfandel for ourselves and the blackberry infused wine as a gift.  What impressed me most was the staff. They enjoyed talking about the history of the space, the wineries and were friendly. When I called and asked if their outside is dog friendly they replied if your dog is friendly they are welcome inside."

The building was cool and the staff was great but I was there to drink wine. Unfortunately, that's where things took a wrong turn. I found most wines to be too young (they needed longer to open up), too sweet (even the dry wines), or too different (the Meade is a fun twist but not my thing). On top of this, it was $15 for 6 tastes (most comparable wineries in the area provide higher value wines for $10). This winery can be skipped."

                "description": "Six shooters is a tasting room that highlights 5 Texas wine makers (Legato, Cowtown, Cross Timbers, Yepez, and Clear Creek).  It is located in the historic Rocky Hill complex next to Fiesta Winery 290.    I love how they have created a space in which new meets old world country.  The tasting room is located in what was an old Tabaco barn from Kentucky, and is surrounded by a modern exterior which is the gift shop and seating area.  This place has a fun vibe, and is definitely not the place to go if you are a serious wine connoisseur interested in the 411 on the wine maker and wine making process. The staffs were extremely friendly, but had only limited knowledge.  It was crowded the day that I came and one staff member tried to keep up at the register, while the other was running around pouring wine.  It was clear they were short staffed, and later I learned that someone had called in sick.  I waited patiently to be helped, and I was welcomed warmly and provided a tasting menu and list.  You can have 6 tastes for $10 and keep the souvenir glass.  With 5 wine makers the selection to choose from is large.  It is nice that they provide some high level tasting notes for all the possible selections to choose from that day.  I stayed away from the Legato options as I have tasted them in the past and found them to be too fruit forward, and weak. From what I tried, I found the selection to be hit or miss. From the selection of wineries, there wasn't anything that WOW'd me.  Overall, they were the typical fruity weak to average Texan wine.  I have a wide palette and do appreciate sweet wines.  The one wine that stood out for me was the Cowtown  Stockyard Peach.  I have had several peach wines in the past, and this is one of the best I have had to date. For comparison, I liked it even better than the Fat Ass Winery Peach offering, which I enjoy (but they are always sold out of).  I will definitely come back, as it could very easily be that from the large menu, I just chose the weaker options."

                "description": "Still a great location and a quaint cottage is the way to go.  On this occasion we couldn't hang at our usual spot, the Weber House so our first two nights were in the Alamo.  The remaining night we we able to go to the mother ship.  Getting to the Alamo meant a fairly steep climb up 20 or so steps, bear that in mind.  The room itself was large, with a bathtub and shower, two bathrooms curiously.  Bear in mind that all the rooms or cottages we have stayed in the past are simply constructed, unfinished wood planks and distressed wood finishes.  I will admit, the couch was well worn and infamous problematic TV on how to operate it was still there.  I often wonder why they never provide a guide of some sort.  There is a Gideon Bible tho.  Pretty solid guide in some circles.  If it seems silly to mention the amenities, bare in mind, some of us like to just chill rather than walk the street's and wineries.  Also, it is mandatory for a day of recovery when enjoying said wineries... ahem.  Weber House is lovely, could definitely use a new couch, it's a sleeper sofa and I can understand that perhaps they have been ordered and are still awaiting arrive.  I'm still waiting on a bed we ordered many months ago.  My only wish here is that the would replace the commode seat.  I had mentioned this in my first review.  Can catch you unawares, so having a seat is definitely a recommend for dudes.  Staff are always wonderful and we enjoy a frequent return discount and they also knocked off a couple of bucks for the construction which was pounding at 8.30ish the morning of the 8th."

                "description": "We had reservations for two nights.  Overpriced for what you get.  Amenities of the past no longer exist.  No freshly baked cookies to greet us, as shown in their ads, because of contactless check-in.  Library and common area not properly set up to be accommodating.  Minimal breakfast left at your door (no fresh juice).  The grounds looks run down and the staff seem overworked and there was trash and empty drink cans from previous guests left sitting around outside.  The fountain outside our room was dirty and not properly cared for.  Check-in is supposed to be 3pm, however, another couple in our party had to wait until 3:40pm because their cabin was not ready.  Then we noticed cat throw up from a stray cat on the porch and dirty mop bucket water being tossed right in the dirt in front of the entry to their door.  So we had to go get someone to clean it up.  This was their 30th wedding anniversary getaway, so we were all disappointed.   The cabins were okay, but not worthy of the $230.00 a night that we were charged. Will not stay again."

Breakfast is served daily to your door in a picnic basket at 9AM. And it's great. Super simple but really delicious and better than any stateside continental breakfast I've had in a long time. The scone even tasted like a real life Bri'ish version.    The check-in is super simple once you get the hang of it. Check your email for the code to your room. Locate your room via the map they send to you/ or the map they post in the great hall.   All and all, it's the best and most comfortable hotel in Fredericksburg. It's also minimally invasive, i.e., you will not have rando people talking to you all of the time. You're on your own. And I like it that way.   Lastly, it's a really short jaunt to town if you want to get those steps in."

                "description": "Had some mixed feelings about this place. I think I would stay again but, would definitely make sure to pick one of the stand-alone cabins. We stayed in one attached to the great hall, which was fine since it was a week night. I imagine during the weekend it might get kind of loud.  We checked in super late and didn't realize that the last 4 digits of your phone number are the key to your door. It wasn't stated in the email (if it was, I guess we missed it but, neither my boyfriend or I saw it). We struggled to get in but, once we called they immediately answered and assisted us in accessing our room.   The room was cute and had a modern rustic feel too it. They give you tea and water bottles and provide a small refrigerator and dishes. The soap was also very high quality and smelt great.  The breakfast is delivered promptly at 9:00 am. It will wake you up as they knock on the door 2-3 times to let you know it's there. If you like to sleep in, be aware of this. The breakfast itself was decent quality and as expected. It would be nice to have a little bit of sauce options (ketchup, hot sauce, etc.) but, it's just nice they deliver it to your room and is a cute feature of the BandB.   The drawbacks were if you get a room by the great hall it only comes with a stand up shower! So if you want that claw foot tub make sure to book a suite/stand alone cabin. The shower in our room had a drainage issue and turned into a mini bath for our feet, which was gross and a big turnoff.   Additionally, we were greeted to our room by a dead squirrel. It was just laying there across from the door to our room. Thankfully, my boyfriend and I have a sense of humor and realized it was probably one of the many cats on the property that left us this little gift. We did check in very late at night and the white cat was out causing trouble. Obviously, it's not the fault of Hoffman Haus but, was still kind of a gruesome welcome. On the plus side, the black and white cat was friendly and let us pet him.   With that being said, giving 4 stars. I would try a different room upon returning and go based off both experiences."

The beds were super comfortable and the daily breakfast was divine. Took one star away for cleanliness and amenities. The floors were so dirty that after only 30 seconds of walking around your feet/socks started to turn black. Also, the kitchen was a bit lacking. There was no cutting knife, no spatula, no small pot, no strainer, also the electric tea kettle had not been cleaned out after last use. Also, there were no laundry bags, which would have been a nice touch. We thought one room had them, but it turned out to be a previous guests garment bag that they had left behind. Would stay there again, but might try one of the newer houses."

The breakfast basket was such a treat and delivered at 9am like clockwork.  Hope to come back and stay In their Victorian 2 floor house on the property. Despite covid restrictions this place would be a real gem for a celebration of any sort!"

There was a dinner event that turned into a party with loud music and drunk people on the patio outside until at least midnight. The only access we had to after hours assistance was phone numbers on the doors of the great hall which meant I would have had to walk through the patio party to call someone to ask them to quiet down and I chose not to do that. Party goers staying across from us continued to be loud afterwards. Next time we will probably try somewhere else."

                "description": "I can't believe it's taken me over a year to review this adorable historical Fredricksburg gem. My first experience here was for our first anniversary. We had a blast!  The Hoffman Haus is part bed and bedfast, part event venue.  It's situated in the center of this historic tiny German town among wineries and shops. And the fact that it's a close walking distance to everything makes it a convenient choice for your stay.   Every room is different. Ours was cozy, charming and spacious. We had a private deck with rocking chairs, a large bath garden bath tub, a living room and simple but comfortable bedroom. In the mornings, we were served a fresh breakfast in an adorable vintage picnic basket that arrived outside our door. Quiche and fruit, anyone? The service was warm and friendly, and made us feel right at home.   I loved the little thoughtful touches throughout. For example,  they had a guest book in our room for us to sign and share our experience. It was cool to read notes from other couples who shared the same experience. If you go, look for ours! :)"

                "description": "I decided to visit Fredericksburg one weekend and found, through internet research, that this BandB was one of the very best.  I arrived after their scheduled check-in time but called a week prior to give them notice and was given alternate procedures for check-in which was great.  Upon arrival to the room (Texas Bunkhouse), which was cozy and the largest room for my particular price point, I would describe it as upscale rustic.  It seemed to have a majority of the basic amenities you would find in a hotel room.  It had a mixture of modern and antique furnishings and of course polished concrete floors.  This is in a newish building, so you have the rustic atmosphere without the rustic smell.  For an upscale BandB, I thought the room should of had the following items:  - Laundry bag - Slippers (for walking on cold flooring on cold winter nights).   - Soaking tub (only had a stand up shower) - Better shower head with more than just a single setting (and better water pressure) - Consistent, faster internet  One thing I wasn't really fond of were the flies. Maybe there are a lot in the hill country or this particular town, not sure.  There were at least 3 in the room when first arriving and I managed to kill two of them before leaving, but they are annoying and landed on everything.  BREAKFAST Saturday morning breakfast was brought to the door shortly before 9am as promised.  I didn't think this particular breakfast was all that.  It was simple to say the least, compared to the website which seems to portray a more gourmet experience using local ingredients when possible.  There is nothing special about scrambled eggs lightly seasoned with pepper, sausage links that tasted just like frozen jimmy dean from the grocery store, an apple struedel in a bowl, a slice of orange and a strawberry.  Sunday morning was a little better but still keeping it simple.  They gave you a lot of patty sausage, a fruit cup, egg casserole, and a homemade blueberry muffin.    I liked the layout and size of my particular room, but Id be open to try other rooms if I ever returned.  I tried to pick out some movies from their library in the great room but found most all movies are older (2008 and earlier).  This is 2018, they could use a little updating of their collection for sure, to cater to the younger crowd."

Our cottage was spacious, clean, and cute. The soaps in the shower and bathroom were also a highlight- made by the local Hummingbird Farms. Breakfast was served in a basket and delivered to your door each morning at 9am! It was sooo good! We would definitely return."

The Hoffmans Haus is rated as the top Bed and Breakfast in Texas and I can see why. The people are down to earth with complete southern hospitality. The accommodations to the choice of room was beyond customer service.  I could not have been more happier. I loved every aspect. The aromatherapy shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion, the unbelievably comfortable beds, and we can't forget the breakfast in bed. You are surrounded by wine vineyards and German restaurants for those seeking something different. - Happy Traveling"

                "description": "My husband I set up a car service for a Saturday to have a nice, relaxed, chauffeured drive around to wineries for our Anniversary getaway.  We were able to book about a month and a half out and Patrick was very easy to set things up with.  After a little confusion regarding cars and schedule Saturday morning our driver, John, arrived.  He was extremely courteous, gave a few suggestions regarding wineries and the basic plan for the day and was very nice to spend the day with.  Patrick was obviously concerned with making sure we were getting the service we wanted and very friendly when we ending up running in to him at one  of the wineries.    All in all, this is a great service.  They care about their customers having a good time and enjoying their trip.  I would recommend them and use their service again in the future!  Thanks Hill Country Express!"

We saw this little shop and wanted to check it out.   I saw a beautiful cross made out of wine corks and wanted to take a picture to send to my mom. Before I could snap the photo, my hubby pointed out that there was a no photo sign. I turned off my camera on my iPhone, but just as I did the woman behind the counter screamed at me, 'NO PHOTOS!'  My hubby and I explained that we had just seen the sign and had not taken a picture. She screamed again, 'PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY!'   What? Really? I was so embarrassed and I didn't even take a photo. I wish she would have approached the situation differently instead of shaming me.   I will not return because of the way I was treated, and many of the other customers followed me out of the store and commented on how rude she was."

We've enjoyed their wines on a couple of occasions, once because they were cheap on sale, and the second time because we liked it so much the first time.  We haven't been to the actual location, but their products are available at various stores here in Texas, and they're better than most of the Texan ones if you want me to be honest."

Their tasting prices are also very reasonable."

This is a great spot for a glass of wine or to bring a group of friends. We just went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and set everything up with Laurie. She was great to work with and we had an amazing time. We visited a few other winery this weekend and nothing compared to the wine or the hospitality we received from Andreucci. My husband and I have also been fortunate enough to attend a cooking class at Andreucci and can not wait for the next one. Thank you all so much for a beautiful afternoon."

Keep walking down the street to a different wine tasting room. The staff, though interactions were few and far between, were rude and careless. We were invisible. 15 minutes upon sitting until we were greeted. It took another 25 minutes to get a glass of wine, then it was another 92 minutes before we were visited again.   The wine (Nero) was bad like the bottle was left open from 2 days ago and nobody had ordered it since. We just sat there without any options - like being trapped in a timeshare. Finally we had to tell a staff member we needed the check because they clearly had no interest in checking on their tables. There are only 6 tables in the place so I was amazed at how absent the service was. We couldn't get out quick enough.   There are 20+ other places to take your business, so please save yourself the time, stress, anxiety, and go somewhere else in town."

My party waited over twenty minutes and we were never served and left. There was 1 staff and she was overwhelmed.  During that period, I saw over 50 people come in, checked out the situation and then left. Whoever runs this place should be fired. If the owners in Italy knew how much business they're losing, I would assume they would make changes...maybe they don't care!"

                "description": "Top of the WIN list!!   FYI: not a Texas wine  Red Winer lovers, this place is a must!  But white wine drinkers will be equally happy!!  If you've missed it my WIN list is Wineries I Need (WIN) if you only have 1 day in this wine wonderland we call Fredericksburg.  Located on the corner of Main Street and Washington, this tasting room is fun place to enjoy a glass of wine and people watch!    The first time I entered Andreucci Wine Room I was lucky enough to be there when the winemaker himself, Flavio Andreucci, was present.  I seized the moment and had him pick my wines for my tasting!  At Andreucci's you are able to pick any 6 wines (red, white, sparkling or sweet).  Flavio chose the following 5 (I should have let him choose my 6th, my mistake): Prosecco Chardonnay Costavecchia (lalaLOVE) Regale Montepulciano D'Abruzzo (my choice, my least favorite) Regale Black Label  Just like Rosé, I'm usually not a fan of Prosecco, but this one is a winner, winner, chicken dinner!  It is made from 1/3 of each variety of: glera, chardonnay, and peeled pinot noir white grapes.  The result is this sparkling deliciousness!   The Chardonnay is an easy drinking, subtle and smooth white.    Costavecchia is by far my favorite.  I've already returned more than 4 times to have a glass and to purchase bottles!  All the staff are amazingly friendly and knowledgeable about the wine!  They also remember you when you return, which I am a huge fan of with small businesses!!  Insider Tip:  Upgrade for a $10 up charge for a taste of their Premium Reds: Regale Gold Label.  It comes with a to-die-for chocolate truffle.  It is 50% cabernet and 50% sangiovese; aged 1 year individually and then 2 years together.  It's a blend of epic proportions!"

My friend did not get the ones she chose. After the second tasting we decided to leave. Their glasses were dirty. The bartender was definitely not happy to be there. We paid for one full tasting when we only received 4 out of the 6. She even had the audacity to check in front of you if you tipped her. Tipped her for her rudeness and lack of customer service? You're darn tootin' you received a $0 tip. I shouldn't have even paid for the tasting but we wanted to get the hell out there. RUN AWAY. GO ELSEWHERE. Take this review as a sign to run far away!!

                "description": "I stopped in for my first visit a week ago.  It was a nice break to try something new by tasting a variety of wines from Italy versus the routine Texas wines which I  do enjoy.  I am a Red's only fan and was pleased to have enough selections that the Wife and I were able to pick some different selections (~10-12) and get to try almost all of their non-premium Reds.  I really enjoyed several and thought the members prices were reasonable.  Unfortunately the price point for non-members is not competitive with other wines of similar quality and price point available online or at other retailers in my opinion.  Would definitely consider a return trip for a tasting, but that's about it.  Unfortunately, I already have 4 wine memberships and have told the Misses we are not doing, and there are none she was willing to drop so otherwise this one could be a possibility.   I can say, I would have purchased a few bottles of big bold reds (e.g., Primitivo, Regale, and Cab Franc) to take home had I had a member friend with me to get their prices."

You can tell immediately that they have high quality standard levels there. It's nothing like your experience from the very thin and weak Texas and produced wines. Also, they do dinners on Saturday night and the food is out rages! Usually someone from the family in Tuscany is there cooking and it is authentic as it gets. We had an amazing six course meal last Saturday that was the \"best dining experience that I have ever had!\" This is a unique, Italian oasis in the middle of Central Texas. You've got to go!"

Not obnoxious and had not been drinking.  Just wanted to taste some Italian type wines.  Walked in around 1pm.  No other customers there.  Coldly greeted by a female with an extremely heavy accent (I'm assuming Italian but hard to tell).  Gave us a list to check off and basically ignored us.  We gave her the list and she asked us some questions. None of us are hard of hearing, but we could not understand ONE WORD of what she was saying.  Plus whatever she was saying was with an extremely unfriendly attitude.  We walked out.  Went across the street to Cross Mountain, another Italian wine vineyard, and had a great time.  Lady there was super friendly, understandable, with no airs or pretenses.  Stayed for several tastings and walked out buying close to $500 of wine.  We could care less about Andreucci or their wine as the experience was unacceptable.  Will never be back."

                "description": "I was in Fredericksburg today to pick up wine from one of the 5 wineries I belong to (don't judge me because I am a \"wino\".  Fortunately I took some backroads back to San Antonio and happened to see Longhorn Cellars.  Wow, a hidden gem off of the beaten 290 path.  Unfortunately COVID prevented us from stopping in and enjoying the tasting room, BUT, the number on the door allowed me to text and order my wine.  What is awesome about Longhorn is that I could look at their website and see what I wanted and was able to text my order in while I was sitting in the parking lot.    I was greeted by the owner who was sooo happy to tell me about the wines and even shared her favorites so that I could come back and sample when life returns to somewhat normal.  We picked up 2 bottles to try and I am impressed, PLUS, the bottles are much more reasonable than other wineries in the area.  I am looking forward to trying a port wine once they produce it.   If you get a chance, stop by and visit one of the newer wineries in Fredericksburg as I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I AM!  Oh, the bonus is that they have indoor seating which will be nice during the hot Texas summer."

Their indoor tasting room is large and  outdoors they also distance the areas well.   Dog friendly, our host (Nicole?) took great care of us, and her dog Sterling hung out with us and our dog most of the time we were there. We of course did our tasting outdoors as our pup was with us.   We enjoyed the wines on the tasting, brought a few bottles home, and enjoyed hanging out outdoors.   Appreciated that they sold chips and salsa to put a bit of something in our systems while doing the tasting.   We will definitely be back."

                "description": "Overall, there's better wineries based on the knowledge of the staff we had and the type of wines that they had. I don't think I would go back unless I hear news that things have changed.   Winery: This is a very new winery that has been open for the last couple of years. It's part of the 290 Wine Shuttle Route.   Longhorns: I came here on a Saturday morning  right when they opened. Their iconic amulet is the \"longhorn\". We were told there were longhorns here that we can see, but when we got here and finished our tasting, it was hard to see any longhorns. There was probably one at the furthest end of the field, which was disappointing since my boyfriend and I are UT Longhorn fans. The only great longhorn we saw was the one in the front where we got a photo opt. Perhaps it was too early in the day for us to see real ones.   Tasting: You have the option to do shared or individual wine tasting. I think for one person it was $20 for 6 wines. There's other discounts if you end up buying bottles of wines. There's mixed menu or all red menu.   Wines: I did not like the wine selections here compared to other wineries I have been to. Nothing really stood out to me. Out of the 6 wines from the mixed tasting menu, I think my favorite was the Carlito ( red blend of petite sirah, souzao, aglianico, montepulciano)  Atmosphere: As expected, the ambience was southern, rustic, barn decor with longhorn paintings hanging. There's a bar at the very center of the room when you first enter.  Knowledge: This place is new, but has opened for almost 2 years. We had a new person that served us. She wasn't able to give us alot of details about the wine to further the experience. When we asked questions, it was clear she wasn't fully aware of the answer or had to ask someone else. Anyone new working should be paired with an experienced persons, so this doesn't happen."

We look forward to many times revisiting Longhorn Cellars in months and years to come!  It was great to talk with Deanna and Michael Dickey, the owners, and our two servers, Sian and Vinny were knowledgeable and friendly, and made our experience memorable.  This first visit, our faves were the Syrah, the Alicante Bouschet, and the Viognier."

Having visited many wineries including those along 290, have to say Longhorn Cellars are really good. Don't bother stopping at some of the bigger, better known wineries along the route, you won't find a better ref for the price. Their wine club only Syrah stands up to others in the area that have a higher price point. And don't forget to check out the longhorns and Carlito the white donkey who they named a wine after."

                "description": "Owners Dr. Michael and Deanna Dickey are no strangers to wine.  Having spent some quality time in Napa Valley, the dream of having a vineyard and winery of their own was something they turned into reality. Mike Dickey completed courses with the Texas Tech Enology program and along with the guidance of Dr. Bob Young of Bending Branch, he has been producing his own wines. Located at the former location of Rancho Ponte, the Dickey's have breathed new life into this place with their own inside décor and outside vineyard. In addition to their estate vineyard, they also have vineyards near Hye and Pontotoc for sourcing Texas Hill Country AVA grapes.  Since opening just over a year ago, Mike and Deanna started serving some Bending Branch wines and wines made from California grapes, they have been slowly making the transition to Texas High Plains AVA sourced grapes and are now gearing up for more Hill Country sourced wines. They have a few flight selections to choose from currently on their menu. For this visited, we opted for the mixed flight, featuring a little bit of everything! For the whites, we started with the 2017 Viognier. Sourced from the Texas High Plains of Reddy Vineyards, this aromatic wine is fresh with some buttery notes and bright acids.  We moved on to the 2018 Twilight Rosé. A blend of 92% Mourvedré and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon from Pontotoc, this off-dry Rosé is quite refreshing for the infamous hot summer Texas days!  For the reds, we sampled the NV Tannat which is a product of the Russian River Valley. This red was a rich wine with a lovely bouquet and a fine smoky finish!  The NV Texas High Plains Syrah has 25% Petite Syrah added to it to help round out that leathery, smoky, and tantalizing full mouth feel. Lastly, we enjoyed the 2014 Carlito's Cuvée. A blend of Souzao, Aglianico, Montepulciano, and Petite Syrah. This California sourced wine has great balance, moderate acidity, and a relatively smooth finish.  We also got to sip the 2018 Viognier, as well.  This release is Texas Hill Country sourced and its profile is completely different than that of the High Plains Viognier. A great treat to test \"battle of the Viogniers\"!   They are also working on a Tempranillo they plan to release in the future, so it is worth your valuable wine stopping time to stop by and taste not only what is currently on the menu but see if anything new has been released yet.  There are additionally plans for a great blend from the Mourvedre, Malbec and Merlot from their estate vineyard. This newest Texas Hill Country boutique winery is a fine addition to the area, and we look forward to stopping by again in the future to see how their menu and wines continue to evolve. The servers are also quite knowledgeable on wine and will provide quality professional service during your tasting session. They are off to a great start in their initial year. Cheers!"

All of my interactions with Aaron were delightful. He was very responsive, answered all my question and we had an awesome time! He even made time to introduce himself at one of our stops to make sure things were going smoothly.  Our driver Carlos helped us along the tour and was awesome as well. He picked us up from San Antonio , drove safe, and made sure we got to every winery on time. He checked us in when we got there and would follow up with us occasionally at each winery to make sure that all our needs were met.   If anyone is looking for a Company to plan a wine tour event I would highly recommend Aaron and Off the Vine. They were very professional and took care of everything for us once we booked."

However, this time, our driver was unprofessional, showed up late, there was no ice in the cooler for us and the air conditioning didn't work. It was such a disappointing experience, that when we told Aaron about it, he offered us a \"huge discount\" next time we'd come back and use them again. We tried to take him up on this for an upcoming weekend. He didn't remember and despite reminding him of the situation, he kept trying to quote us the normal prices. He finally offered it slightly discounted and we agreed to book it, but when we paid the invoice a couple of days later, he cancelled and said we had needed to pay that day if we wanted it, even though he failed to mention that before cancelling. The whole experience was unprofessional and we are highly disappointed in his lack of communication."

Having such a responsive and personal touch is not something to be taken for granted!"

Eric picked my group up at our BandB house right on time, met us with mimosas (it's a bachelorette party after all!), was energetic and made everyone excited to start the day, and was very professional as we hopped around from winery to winery.  There's a variety of different packages to choose from and special pricing available for different occasions.  We loved that we had a variety of wineries to choose from to customize our day.  Eric handled all of the logistics and we got to enjoy the ride.  I would highly recommend this company for any occasion or group!"

                "description": "Wedding Oak Winery opened a second tasting room location at Wildseed Farms.  It's a perfect partnership.  The tasting room space is located at the back of the central building area.  There is a spacious covered patio with tables to enjoy a glass of wine outside.  The tasting room area is small, and has a bar that you can stand and enjoy a tasting at.  You can select from different tasting flights dependent on the style of wine you prefer.  The staff were friendly and informative.    Wedding Oak Winery utilizes 100% Texas grown grapes.  They are sourced from their estate winery and other local growers.  The winery is named after a 400 yr old tree that is located 2.5 miles from their winery in San Saba.  They opened their historic downtown tasting room in San Saba in 2012.  The wine maker is Texas wine legend Penny Adams.  She was the first Texas female wine Master back in the early 80's.  She was a pioneer and played a key role in getting Texas wines on the map.  Her wines are typically blends, and her typical style is to use minimal oak aging.  She has an amazing story of how she fell in love with wine and has been involved in the field since.  The wines here are Texas Terroir focused and made ready to drink now.  I found all the wines I tasted to be approachable and easy to drink.  The wines were well rounded and structured.  There wasn't anything I didn't like, and a few stood out better for my palate for different reasons.  A couple of favorites were Bridal Bliss their sparkling white wine (I like a nice bubbly), and 2014 Sangiovese, and their Albarino.  I plan to visit the San Saba location and would definitely come back for a future visit."

                "description": "Wedding Oak Winery opened a tasting room inside the Wildseed Farms making the stop to see the fields of wildflowers that much more enjoyable. They are located at the back of the center of the building and it has both a gorgeous indoor tasting room and nice patio with comfortable furniture and a fire place. They welcome you to \"sip and stroll\" at this breathtaking property.  I have now visited the tasting room 3 times in the past month as I love the wines and couldn't resist stopping back in after my first visit a few weeks ago. You cannot find their wines in stores so you can either buy on premise (their first winery location is in San Saba), buy online or join the wine club. I had the pleasure of meeting the wine maker and the owner. The wine maker/viticulturist is one talented person who grew her first grapes in the 70s. There is so much more to share about Penny Adams but I will let the wines speak for themselves. There are 13 wines to choose from at the tasting room so there is something for everyone.   Two of my favorite bottles are the Rose 2014 Dry Dolcetto and the and the Tioja 2013 which is a Tempranillo, Tannat and Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The Tioja is not currently available online so there is more reason to visit the winery."

This place was pretty unique - there was a small winery and tasting room on one side and the Wildseed Farms on the other - you can buy plants or walk through the gardens with fields that were just straight blue with Bluebonnets or red with the Indian Paintbrushes. A lot of the area is blocked off so you can't walk and trample the flowers, but there was an open area where you can walk through and take photos.  This place has a huge parking lot but apparently tour buses come through here as well cause the parking lot was packed and there were a ton of people! Nice stop for a photo but didn't try the wine.  I think they have areas to rent as a venue as well but not positive."

The lady pouring the wine was slightly apologetic but refused to sell me a tasting, even though I was willing to rush through it.  I tasted the boldest red they had, and I wasn't too impressed; it was pretty uninspiring.  I bought a glass of rose, since she would only sell me a glass at 5:32pm, and for the price, $14 a glass, it was underwhelming.  I pass by this place a lot on my frequent visits to Fredericksburg, and basically they lost a potential repeat customer based on this first experience.  If their wine was more to my liking, I'd probably give it a second shot, but there was nothing impressive here, least of all the customer service."

The staff was delightful and conversational. They were very willing to give you an extra tasting if you asked questions.  The wines I tasted were all rather good. There was one I was very impressed with - a white when I normally drink red!   I would've given this wine tasting room five stars; however, while we were there a patron brought in a dog. Although everyone kept making comments, management allowed the dog to stay. Given they were serving drinks, this should be against the health code.

It was a memorable experience except for the poor treatment we received at Wedding Oak Winery.  One of the associates soured the festivities by condescendingly and loudly accusing one of our guests of being too inebriated to do a tasting at this winery based on her (the guest's) confusion on the setup of the wine tasting menu, which was different from the other wineries we had visited that day. He (the employee, an older man) assumed she was drunk (she had little to drink that day and has an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcohol) and asked the group if a DD was present and continued to interrogate us.   A lot of assumptions were made by this unprofessional individual. I get it...a boisterous loud group of women walk in who look young but are actually successful professionals in their mid to late 30s....still, this guy should not be in a position involving guest interaction. While he did proceed to serve us, members of our group refrained from joining the tasting and/or buying anything at this winery due to his rudeness and overall lack of people skills. On a positive, the manager was very kind, apologized, and said she would follow up. Not sure what that means though.  I do not recommend this place as there are so many other wineries in Fredericksburg that have both great wine AND great service. Innwood and Messina Hof to name a few."

We walk into a charming little shop then made our way back to the wine tasting area. There was a guy behind the bar who didn't even say \"Hello,\" or any other kind of pleasantries. He just kind of shoved wine menus in our direction as we stood there wondering what we had done to deserve rude customer service... There was no place to sit and drink your wine, unless you were a wine club member (which is ridiculous to begin with, considering their completely empty outdoor patio) My friends and I spoke about his rudeness and decided to take our business elsewhere, right down the road to Fiesta Wineries, who were awesome! I suggest not going here unless you expect to be treated like garbage and not even spoken to."

The facility and staff are fine, quite nice actually!  It's just that the wines are not on par with the higher end competitors just down the road.  Now don't get me wrong.  None of these wines was \"bad\".  But, they just weren't that good.  This could come from differences in palates.  These wines tended to be simplistic and fruit forward with little depth and very light tannins.  They would likely appeal to a novice wine drinker and are probably a good starting point to learning about wine.  If you're new to wine, you will probably enjoy this place, so give it a shot."

I arranged this party bus as a birthday gift for my boyfriend; he was suggested to me by a friend who said that he knew Larry personally and that he would be the best guy for the job.  I am glad I listened to my friend because Larry definitely was!  Going into this, I had never been on a wine tour.  I didn't know where to go or what to expect.  All I had to do was tell him that and he was able to arrange a kick-ass evening/morning for my boyfriend and our 19 friends.    This guy definitely knows his stuff (and texas wine country!) and it really comes through when he's helping you plan your route.   He was kind and patient and most importantly, he was prompt!  (Even though my boyfriend was running late because he didn't know about the surprise waiting for him on the bus.)    Many many MANY cheers to Larry and Mike's Luxury Transports.  I will definitely be recommending them to everyone I know in the future (and using them again!)"

His wife intruded on our private event and followed us around and even participated in the wine tour! The winery he took us to for lunch wasn't serving food that day so we had to wait two hours for sandwiches, which we still had to pay for! It's supposed to be a luxury bus and it was more like a school bus. The refreshments provided were flat. The tasting and lunch weren't included in the fee so we had to tote our purses around everywhere. It was overall a terrible experience. He was the only one who could get us in at such short notice and I absolutely know why now. Just AWFUL."

                "description": "BEST CHOICE!!! We had a one of the owners, Larry, as our driver; Such a nice and personable man. He got in on our conversations when prompted but didn't butt in or intrude. He knew all the great places to go and helped us decide. I had a list of 7 places and asked for him to help us narrow down. He talked with me and we nixed a few and replaced a couple with newer or better ones. They are a much better rate than all the other tours. Everyone else was charging around $150 per person for a choice of 5 vineyards to be visited on a set schedule. I wanted freedom to go where ever we chose, leave when we wanted or stay as long as we wanted. Larry gave us a flat hourly rate regardless of the number of people and NOT including our wine tasting fees. The reason this is GOOD is because when you visit a bunch of vineyards within 4-6 hours, you may want to share tastings with another person. My boyfriend and I did our own tastings for the first two vineyards, then we started sharing the tastings after that. If we had gone with one of the other tour companies, they would have charged each person for the tasting with no option of sharing. (Note: we visited 6 places and all the tastings were $10 per tasting and all allowed sharing)  For 14 people, a tour company would have charge $150pp = $2100 and only included 5 vineyards and on a set schedule.  For Mikes Luxury Transports the price was $110 per hour for a 14 passenger bus and were free to go to as many places as we wanted (6 in our case) We got 6 hours = $660. Because some of us shared tastings some of the times, the total tasting cost ranged from $420-840. SO, this means at the MOST (if everyone got their own $10 tasting at every single vineyard) the total was still a $600 savings...we saved about $900 b/c most of us starting sharing tastings by the 2nd or 3rd vineyard.   And as to Jennifer L.'s poor review, if she would have done her research she would know that almost all the vineyards don't serve food...just little pre-made snacks. There were a couple that have FOOD TRUCKS at the vineyard, but it is not the vineyards fault, nor the drivers fault, if the food truck doesn't show up that day. And they knew in advance that the tasting fees were not included in the hourly rate, therefore, they should have been prepared with cash in pockets if they didn't want to tote their purses around. And why in the world would she expect a driver to pay for lunch for them? Seems like she simply didn't do even the basic of research on the area."

The prices are better than most other wine tours even for small parties.  Tour = I suggest 3 wineries because 4 takes to long and you'll group will be too drunk to enjoy the rest of the day/night. Go to sister creek winery first in Sisterdale to have a nice scenic drive/ visit luchenback on your way back (20 min drive/8 tastings at sistercreek)  Limo = very clean, great air conditioning and bluetooth hookup for your phone to play music (bring a USB cable just in case the bluetooth doesn't work) water and snacks provided plus free wine glass at end.  Staff and drivers = The company works with 2 other wine tours and will help each other out if they can not accommodate your group (must be good people if they help others) They are just normal people who will go out of their way to accommodate you. They will even stay in contact with you through text prior to pick up and during the tour. Ask for Kim to drive your group!  Lunch = lots of options but we went with the chipotle chicken wrap which was great (comes with chips and a large cookie)  Payment = will accept any form and you typically pay after the last winery.   Highly recommend this TOUR!"

                "description": "New Years Day...noon hour...Marjan and I spied the stone gate opening to the grounds of The Edge, one of the newest wine venues outside Fredericksburg. First imagined as an upscale location for weddings and parties, it has been transformed, and is now also a very serious entry to the burgeoning wine industry in the area.  The main building sits not on the shoulders of HWY 290 as many wine houses, but rather a short drive up a gentle rise to the site. What meets the eye is an expansive structure with a 5 story tower to the left.  The building is impressive in scale, think Agustin Vin, or Grapecreek, or Becker Vineyards scale.  Entering beneath the stone colonnaded portico first see the wine bar area, left of that are rows of tables for patrons, and right of the bar area, spacing devoid of seating:  perhaps a dance floor?  The ceilings soar at least three stories, more likely four, and beyond the wine bar, complete, unobstructed access to the patio given a very, VERY open design.  Beyond the patio are terraced grounds with additional tented seating,  some widely spaced on the grounds.  We counted at least two stone water features, the sound of water cascading down the man made waterfalls adding more pleasure to the day. Beyond that, there is a drop of maybe 60 feet,  leading to 100 acres of frontage on the meandering Pedernales River.  The  river and the surrounding oaked countryside make for a breathtaking visual treat.   And to add spice to the scene, we noticed a fly fisherman plying his skills along the banks.  Picturesque!       Of the tower to the left, the structure is designed as a multi level observation tower, complete with wine bar service, that will be available to wine club members.  The fifth floor will serve as a type of \"corporate hospitality floor\" reserved for the highest level of wine club members.  The views of the river and countryside are remarkable from each level!      As we munched from our charcuterie board, we sampled several of the wine offerings: delicious dry whites, but we particularly enjoyed the cabernet sauvignon.  Of the wines, grapes are grown in East Texas (Lubbock area?), a consequence of association with English Newsom Cellars.  We have found that individual tastes vary widely for wine lovers, but suffice it to say that we enjoyed the offerings so much that Marjan immediately decided membership.  The quality of the wines, the impressive physical plant, the expansive grounds and the beauty of the acreage and river....well, membership was just too much to pass up.       We have visited a number of winerys in the area, and frankly, we consider The Edge second to none for the mentioned features.  When you happen to visit Fredericksburg, take the short drive east of town to this winery.  We think you will enjoy! Be safe!!"

                "description": "How absolutely beautiful this new venue/winery is! It was our first stop on our 290 wine tour and not many people got off. BIG MISTAKE!! While this venue is still going through the last of some minor renovations, this amazing, scenic venue will not only leave you speechless, but it will also leave you with some amazing pictures throughout your visit.  All wines are made and grown in Lubbock. Suttle tasting wines that are perfect for a relaxing visit to enjoy the view and everything this place has to offer.  We decided to go for the wine tasting. Luis was our wine connoisseur who was extremely knowledgeable and genuinely had a passion for wine. He was very attentive with an all-around likeable personality. Definitely made us feel comfortable! $25 each for wine tasting experience and believe we had 5 samples. I can definitely see this place becoming very popular. Highly recommended."

                "description": "This winery/tasting room and venue is both beautiful and quite full of great wines to enjoy. The atmosphere and grounds are quite stunning with 360 picturesque views of the Hill Country. However, this review is solely based on service and a shortage of staffing which is a national problem, I'm aware. However, when a consumer is charged a mandatory 20% service charge that's where I feel like I'm entitled to review something that I was forced to support monetarily. I did a tasting, it took almost an hour at the bar which kept me from my group and enjoying the views outside. It was half full of patrons during latter part of day, a slow Saturday compared to many others I've experienced in Fredericksburg. My poor server Bailey was great, but, she was helping so many others and making boxes that there was no way she could help us through the tasting. So another took over (didn't explain the wine). I decided to not even try the last sample because by then I was infuriated. I asked the guy to just pour the last sample of the current #4 sample and a glass of that wine I'm buying so I could just close out. He said no he'd rather pour the sample then the glass. Fine, he left again of course helping another patron and I waited again. The glasses were $14/15 ea. My friend and I left thirty something cash on bar and asked for the glass of wine so we could after an hour go outside. \"I need to ring you up\" \"uhhhh ok, it's cash here\" he said \"no it's $38 for the two glasses and 20% tip\". (Fine, here is the mandated tip for the service I did not receive on top of your pay.)  Look, I'm in hospitality and client based services. I know that I would never require someone to tip me if I performed poorly. Gorgeous place and good wine but highly unjustified mandatory service charge when the service was complete crap. The other two vineyards had service (go to Signor) so on point I would have given 10% on top of the 20%. I'll be back, maybe..."

Until we found The Edge wedding venue.. it is PERFECT. It's absolutely gorgeous and so romantic! They truly went above and beyond with every last detail to provide everything you will need and want on your wedding day. They are also so easy to work with and obviously want to make your special day magical. I can't wait to post a review with pictures after my wedding day!!"

The architecture is jaw-dropping with its juxtaposition of the land, they worked with the land rather than trying to make the building compete with the scenery; I can't wait to see how the pictures come out. As the sun begins to set and the lights are shining, it's breathtaking. The staff themselves are the among the kindest and most accommodating, they made sure we were happy with every detail before moving forward! The on-site lodging, honestly I could move into them they are so beautifully decorated. We couldn't be happier with our decision to have our dream wedding at our dream venue, The Edge!"

Not only because of the amazing service and pricing, but also for the flexibility of locations! Most other wine shuttles had restrictions on certain wineries and times, but Lucian was super accommodating with our scheduled wine tastings and was able to drive us anywhere we wanted! He picked us up directly from our Airbnb, dropped us right off at our destinations and was available as soon as we were ready to head back to town. He had waters, music and even surprised us with birthday balloons and party tiaras/hats for my 2 friends celebrating their birthday (we wore them all day!!) I couldn't recommend Texas Tour Co enough for your touring needs in and around Fredericksburg!"

We had a large group in town for a weekend and Lucian picked us up where we were staying.  He had waters for our group which was great.  He was so flexible and took us to multiple locations throughout the day.  He was so nice and friendly and offered great recommendations for places to visit.  He is extremely affordable and we will definitely use his shuttle the next time we are in town.  Thank you Lucian for making our visit stress free!!!"

I tried texting the number which was mentioned by their answering machine, and received a text back that they forgot to add us to the pickup. They did not call or mention rescheduling. It seems like there may be poor communication between their booking, tour coordinator, and driver. I'd recommend finding another tour."

We were taken to several wineries and stayed a generous amount of time until we were ready and just able to stay on track to visit the ones he recommended. I've been to Fredericksburg several times though never to any of the wonderful wineries we visited this trip, and the atmosphere and experience was impeccable at each.

                "description": "My husband and I used George 290 wine tours a few years ago and had a great experience with George and recommended him to our friends and family. Fast forward to the past weekend where I attended my sisters bachelorette party. Our driver was very unprofessional. We were rushed at our wineries and we didn't  get to finish our tasting at the 1st winery. Then he got into it with our wine guide at the 3rd winery when our guide asked him to take our wine to the van. We were later informed our driver has a bad reputation at some of the wineries in town. Overall we were very disappointed and will not be using this company in the future or recommending them again. I also reached out to the owner and was told I would get a call but never did."

If you are looking for great wine, beautiful views, and a worry free experience, George's 290 Wine Tours is the way to go! With our tour (about 4 hours), we visited 3 wineries, tasted about 12 wines, had lunch and snacks, and pick up and drop off transportation accommodations (at no extra charge)! I would HIGHLY recommend George to anyone looking to do a wine tour in Fredericksburg!"

                "description": "Outstanding tour! George was very responsive prior to our arrival making sure he knew all of our likes and desires of where to visit. First he picked us up in his Excursion limo stocked with water and stemware. Went to Calais Winery first. Ben the young French-American vintner lead the tasting. He's very knowledgeable. Great boutique winery and vineyard. Then we headed to William-Chris which was larger but a fabulous spot. Tara led our tasting and it was great. Last we went to Becker. It's beautiful and lots of shopping. Got a nice tour of the processing room, bottling area and barrel room.   I highly recommend George Burns and his team. We will be back!!"

First of all, our driver was like family. He was right on the spot whenever we needed him. And even when it got unseasonably cold, he got blankets from the car and made sure we were all taken care of. This is 100% the way to go for wine tours of the hill country. Not only is it safe, but every little need you can think of is catered to."

George was very helpful in getting everything organized and made sure we had was we wanted for lunch and figuring out which wineries we would enjoy. We did the tour just before New Year's and Mike was awesome at making sure we were warm enough by getting us blankets and stuff at the winery and generally that we were comfortable. The whole thing definitely exceeded expectations! He even texted the next to wish us a happy new year and rest of our stay in Fredericksburg. Highly recommend this tour!"

                "description": "This was the best part of our trip! A group of 10 ladies from my neighborhood traveled to Fredericksburg to celebrate Mother's Day and we chose George's 290 Wine Tours. George chauffeured is himself and we couldn't have been taken better care of. He arrived promptly and immediately asked to take our picture. He gave us a synopsis of what our day was going to look like and told us a little bit about each winery. We piled comfortably into his 15 passenger limo-style van and headed off. He gave us access to the radio so we could sing along to our own playlist. It was a little chilly this weekend so he was so gracious to bring us blankets and jackets from the van when requested. He is obviously well-respected in the 3 wineries we visited. He took care of everything from checking us in and making sure we left in adequate time to arrive at our next destination. He was the perfect gentleman. (A few of the ladies overheard him taking a call from his wife and were so impressed that he treated her with dignity and respect as well. We were so impressed we asked if he could give our husbands lessons!) If you are looking for a fabulous experience you are in for a treat with George's 290 Wine Tours."

                "description": "I recently was part of a plot to get one of my good friends and roommates engaged, and her boyfriend decided that on the last leg of a wine tour of Fredericksburg would be the perfect place to pop the question!  I looked at a lot of reviews and finally chose George's 290 Wine Tours and I couldn't be more happy!  I decided to go for the private limo tour and we were treated like royalty!  George had arranged everything and had some very interesting history to go along with all of our stops!  He chose some of the smaller wineries on the 290 Wine Road and they all knew George and I feel that they treated us better because we were with him (though if you want less crowds go on a Sunday)!    The proposal plan went off without a hitch and when I needed to get just a bit more time for the boyfriend to get set up at the last winery George sprung for an extra beer tasting at our lunch spot.  I would recommend George to anybody looking to tour the wineries in Fredericksburg.  He knows everybody, he's got great knowledge of wine and the industry, and he makes sure that you get the most out of every stop!"

                "description": "I initially called another Fredricksburg wine tour, and they were not available on the date we needed.  The owner of the tour suggested that I call George's 290.  She said they had a great reputation.  I decided that must be the best recommendation of all, and wow was I right.  The booking was very personal and easy.  We chose a Saturday, 3 winery tour with lunch.  Mike picked us up downtown Fredricksburg, and 2 others were already in the stretch SUV limo.  The limo was extremely nice.  We went to three wineries, the first was Kuhlman.  This had a wonderful food - wine pairing, which was awesome.  We then went to William Chris, which was our favorite.  The third was Hilmy (Dammit David was great here!).    The best part of the trip was Mike our guide.  I highly recommend you ask for Mike.  He was INCREDIBLE!!  Very attentive, informative and nice as can be.  We wished he could've just hung out and drank with us!   If you are going to Fredricksburg, Texas for a wine tour, call George's 290.  You will NOT be disappointed!"

We didn't have to wait in any lines and it was clear that he has connections at the local wineries. People know him by name and as part of \"George's group\" there are some additional perks.   His pricing includes the tasting fees and he books appointments at the locations for you. We didn't know much about the local wineries so George chose locations for us, and he did a great job! He is also extremely knowledgable about the history of the land and business. I really enjoyed getting to hear some of the backstory to the places we visited. If you're looking to tour the local wine country, use George as your tour guide! You won't regret it."

We were celebrating my best friends bachelorette party and they made it a perfect first wine trip for our bride and all her friends. Thank you so much George and Andy for all your help!! I can't wait to use y'all again in the future. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for any groups planning a wine trip!!"

The options that he presented coupled with his passion for going above and beyond even if she and I were the only two people in the limo was impeccable. He quoted 158 plus tax and grat. with no increase if we were alone. The other companies that I spoke with offered snacks and with that price we got lunch with an amazing menu to choose from. I had a huge Fiesta chicken salad and she had a huge turkey sandwich with her choice of pasta salad or chips. She chose chips and we shared each other's entrees and got to know Steve while he ate with us. There was also another couple that rode with us and we got along with them really well. We toured three wineries which Steve was very knowledgeable not only about the wineries that we were touring but a host of other places and things to do in Fredricksburg. We toured from 11:50 to after 5:00 You can feel not only his passion for customer service pertaining to his limo business. He's extremely passionate about wine and has a great rapport everyone at the wineries. The wineries that he choose were also amazing. Everyone there was really knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile to insure that you leave there with some knowledge about the various wines that they make. He took us to feed donkeys after our last tour which was totally unexpected. Then he took us to a place that made chocolate as another added bonus. Steve made our first experience in Fredricksburg one that we will never forget. We will definitely be back in Fredricksburg and will look forward to future tours with Steve and Creekstreet Tours. Thanks Steve for an amazing time and for going above and beyond for making this a memorable experience for us!"

Pace yourselves - the wine sneaks up on you and we had dinner reservations at 7 we almost didn't make ;)"

                "description": "This place is in downtown Fredericksburg. Looks more like a storefront than a winery. They had like 20 different wines that they serve. I learned a couple of different things from Fredericksburg Winery. It was very interesting. They also have different jellies and jams that were very delicious. That's how they get you. First you drink the wine then you eat the crackers with jelly. Not much to look at but fun place to come visit. So if you're in Fredericksburg make it a point to stop at Fredericksburg Winery. You won't regret it. Out of the 20-something wines that they have I'm sure they'll have one you'll like. Enjoy"

I had two girl friends come visit me last weekend and of course what did they want to do?   TAKE A WINE TOUR!!!!    I was kind of reluctant because this is something I thought only tourists would enjoy but boy was I wrong!  George has not only been doing this for about 17 years and is so much fun, he is also educational.   I learned so much about the wine, grapes and why this area has done so well with making wine.  Plus, George was born and raised here so he can make great recommendations for restaurants, etc.   What a treat.  He is professional and has a beautiful, clean, comfortable limo.  I HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking for a unique wine tasting experience.  He even provides a wonderful lunch from the famous Peach Tree at of the wineries.  It's a must do!"

My husband and I had booked a tour with them and this past weekend our 4 year old son was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. I called yesterday and spoke with Randy (I believe) and without a single hesitation, he asked for my address and told me that although it had already been charged, he was putting a refund check in the mail right away. I appreciate the compassion that he showed and how quickly he was willing to help out. What a great company!"

We had a party of 6 first day and 10 the next. He brought a larger van for the second day which gave ample room for us and our \"stuff\". He was super sweet and got a stool out at every stop and helped everyone out of the van. Both days of driving were 8+ hours. We went all over the place! It was the best option for us, we designed our own itinerary and it was fantastic! Highly recommend IF you are a planner and can make your own itinerary. Service was exceptional."

We were picked up on time, but the van was over a decade old, with numerous stains on the seats, and bolts were holding the ceiling fabric up. Our first driver, David, could only drive with his seat reclined all the way. He was weaving in the lane multiple times, and joked that he was drunk. Because he was mumbling and erratically driving, I had to directly ask him \"are you really drunk\". That's a first.  This would have been a one star review but Driver Pam earned a whole star by herself.  Pam has a larger, much nicer van, and is very professional.   It's $20 per a person and they will take you anywhere except Grape Creek. I suggest you call ahead and get Pam. We won't use them again unless we can have Pam be our only driver."

Every once in a while you come across a person so profoundly awful you wonder how they've made it this far in life with so little self-awareness. I was passing through Fredericksburg and stopped at a gas station. While I was at my pump, I heard someone yelling, \"You a democrat?!\" I looked up. He was yelling at me. \"Are you a democrat?!\"  \"Who cares?\" I responded. I should have said nothing.  This happened once or twice before he got to his pump. I looked on his van. \"Stagecoach Shuttle Service, 290,\" followed by a phone number.  \"All liberals are going to hell.\"  Oh, lord. \"...What?\"  I ask him to explain. He responds with something hateful, but I can't exactly remember what.  \"That's not an argument.\" I responded.  \"There's no argument. It's a fact. I'll be sitting front row, while the liberals burn in hell.\"  I see we're dealing with Texas's finest. Are we really still dealing with this in this day and age? The worst conservative stereotype, come to life. The kind that's made fun of on TV and in movies. The kind raise by hate. The worst kind of evil, the kind that has no idea it's evil.  I give him a couple lines about how God doesn't go around spreading hate. The exchange goes on while my car fills up. I try to appeal to his compassion, which I quickly find out doesn't exist. His pump finishes and he gets in the van.  Me: \"Have a nice life.\"  Him: \"Fuck you.\"  Just impossible to have any sort of conversation with. The lowest of the low.  He got in his van and pulled AROUND TO MY CAR and opened his door.  \"You aren't gonna call the cops. You're afraid of me. Pussy.\"  Frustrated? Certainly. Annoyed? Profoundly. Afraid? No. I've dealt with this kind of scum before. The horrifying societal waste that gives good, ACTUAL Christians a bad name. I wasn't afraid for myself. I was afraid for the people he might shuttle around.  \"Are you drunk?\" I asked.  He closed his door and drove off.  I called the phone number on his van (I took down his plate number as well) expecting to get a boss or front desk to let them know that they've made a huge mistake hiring this absolute psychopath, but no, he picked up.  \"Oh, you must be who I spoke to at the gas station.\"  I rolled my eyes and hung up. He called back and left a voicemail telling me not to bother with the cops, that they already know all about him, and telling me that I'm gonna burn in hell because I'm from Florida (he saw my license plate) and apparently we're trying to steal an election.  A few hours later he left another voicemail asking me to call him back.  I was going to stop in Fredericksburg because it looked nice, but this little encounter ruined any desire I had to stay there. Here's hoping the actual town is better than him.   (I will update this if he leaves any more voicemails)."

I waited until the scheduled time to call him and he suddenly stopped answering his phone.  I called the alternative number and the lady there told me I had to call him directly.  Even though I left a message at both numbers, I never heard back, and my friends and I had to make last minute arrangements, which almost left us late for our commitment.  I still have not heard back from them.

Everything went smoothly, so when that same sister got engaged and wanted her bachelorette party to be held in Fredericksburg, I gave Stagecoach a call.   Cole was great from start to finish. I'm a serious planner, and he helped me with winery suggestions, timing of the day, and dinner venues. He carted our things back and forth from the van and even went back to a winery when I thought I'd left my sweater on the chair.   Towards the end of the day, we received extremely bad news about a loss in the family. Cole was very understanding in our change of plans for the evening and called us a few days later with his condolences and to check in on our family.   All in all, I can't say enough great things about our experience. For such a hard day, he made it as easy as it could be. I'd highly recommend Stagecoach Shuttle Service.

We get two our second winery and the shuttle we were on broke down completely. I was told that they did not have anything else available, so we were going to be taken to the next place in two separate cars. These were obviously the owner's personal vehicles. The whole point of our trip was to spend the ride together, so when I brought up my concerns to the owner, he said \"YOU NEED TO GROW UP.\" He said things like this happen all the time, and that i needed to get over it. I was highly offended by his comment, but when I told him if that is how he runs his business, he said he was done with me and that the tour was over. At the end he gave us a discount and took us in the two cars, but even after him allowing the tour to continue, I was appalled by his customer service. I was embarrassed with the rest of the party that I hired a company that would treat their customers this way."

                "description": "Reviewed October 31, 2018  Clean, Quiet and Comfortable We were there after there was a big weekend celebration in Fredericksburg. The crowds were gone and the summer tourist season at end. The hotel was not crowded. We had a nice quiet two night stay. It is a nice clean hotel, with a good staff and a huge pool. Many of the rooms have a balcony overlooking the pool. The weather was perfect for using the balcony, sitting outside and enjoying the evening. Note: This review and photos were originally posted on Tripadvisor by Spike S."

                "description": "I came for 2 nights over a weekend in June 2020. Overall good place to stay, close to Main Street which is why I chose it. Unfortunately, I realized when I was there it didn't seem safe to walk as a solo person with the lack of sidewalks around that area.   Service was really nice upon checking in. The had decent options for individually wrapped items for breakfast and offering coffee (had to request from the breakfast attendant).   I did not have time to hang out by the pool, I wish I would have. It looked great!   My room was showing some wear but it was fine, I was gone most of the day and wasn't there to be in the room. My biggest problem came when I set the fire alarm off in my room when I was taking a shower. How is that possible? After rushing around to get clothes on I realized no one else was leaving the building and the alarm shut off. I hear the employees talking outside my door about sometimes the alarm goes off because of the shower steam. The smoke detector was not in the bathroom.   I just expect more for the price I paid for that room. Would I stay here again? Maybe and if I could a better rate."

                "description": "This place does not have a active hot tub working so if you are booking do not do this on this premise as it would be false advertisement.  The front desk said there is just one part missing for the hot tub and that's the reason it's now working but didn't say anything if they are even actively trying to even fix it. Customer service is just as disappointing here. If you are looking for somewhere to simply sleep and have a roof over your head this isn't like the typical holiday inn experience so do with that information what you want."

Wish it was warmer to get in the pool but my kids did. They had fun. We left for the day to hike and when we got back our room was made up and cleaned again, what a lovely surprise! We will definitely book here again."

                "description": "I will start out with the good, this hotel was very clean, had plenty of parking and was in a great location, it also has a really great pool, which was one of the biggest reasons for booking our stay here.  If everything had gone as planned I could have easily given it 5 stars with no question BUT this is why I didn't. Like I said before, we booked this hotel primarily for the awesome pool, and it was awesome. I booked a room with a pool view (hoping we could upgrade to a balcony pool view when we arrived) specifically and two queen beds for our family, we arrive and go to check in and there were two ladies at the desk, one was really friendly, the other was mad that she was alive that day or maybe she was mad I was alive that day and bothering her, who knows.  I give her my name and she did her thing and gave us a key, we head to the room and open the door to our pool view with one king size bed in it, sooo we head back to the front desk and I tell her that I booked a room with two beds (we have our 13 yr old son) she sighs heavily, looks at the computer, and tells me it says a king size room, so I pull out my printed confirmation and tell her is says I had two queens,  pool view, to which she accusingly says to me \"you must have booked online, this is what happens\" well yes I did book online because it is 2020 and that's what everyone in the entire world does but I digress, then she gets up with an \"aye yi yi\" and walks off to find the friendly lady.  The friendly lady comes back and says she has to do some switching around but she will find us a room.  Great, we are so excited to get to our room, and get settled in.   She comes over brings me a key and tells me how to get there but this time we have the bed but no pool view, which was the entire reason I specifically booked a room with a POOL VIEW.  We were thankful to get our sleeping situation settled and I got over the fact that we didn't have a pool view by the second day, well, in all honesty I was still a little salty about it but we had a great view of some really cute houses so that was nice but what I haven't gotten over was the fact that this lady treated me like it was my fault the system didn't get the reservation right and didn't try to hide it at all. I would def recommend the place but I paid for a room with a view and at the end of the day that is really all I wanted."

                "description": "Our experience with this hotel had mixed emotions. We enjoyed the beautiful pool and friendly staff. Unfortunately considering the 4 out of 5 rating on hotels.com. It fell far from that for us. Our room showed signs of poor housekeeping. From the crumbs on the sleeper couch and surrounding chairs and tables, to the poorly vacuumed floor. Our A/C thermostat was also unreliable, it was either too cold or too warm. The Worst thing we experienced were the multiple roaches we had to kill around our room. This really put a damper on our comfortable stay at this hotel. Overall our stay wasn't as Great as we expected considering the high rating."

I have had no issues it's any IHG Let me start off but this is or was my anniversary weekend and I had book the nicest room the hotel had with a in room jacuzzi. Paying a lot out of pocket for the extras!   Once I arrived at the front desk to check in I was told the room overbooked.  Great.  We ended up getting a king  that overlooked the pool. Who cares.  But the toilet ran all night and no sleep due to the toilets   Check out time is 11 am.   We had cleaning people walk into our room at 10.12 am with no knocking  our not disturb sign was on the door.   We then called the front desk and asked for a 12:00 check out which was granted and  the front desk started calling 11:03 am asking if we was going to extend our stay if not get out.        Stay away from this overbooked  prices to high hotel."

                "description": "My family stayed with this branch 3/8/20, and upon arrival which was late in the evening the first room we went to was dirty, the second a couple was sleeping in and finally third times the charm and 45 minutes later we were able to get a room. We paid $225.99 total. We stayed less than 12 hours. Assistant Manager Jeanie was less than hospitable when I relayed the errors that occurred. She did offer us points back, but she was unable to credit back for any of the cost of the room. I will not be staying at this branch ever again. She said I should be happy because typically their rooms are $250/night. So if you expect them to make things right when they fumble, don't stay here. If you don't care if your room is dirty or you barge in on a couple sleeping then this is your place!"

The lobby is very well cared for and clean. The guest rooms are very clean and provide many accommodations for your satisfaction. The pool is perfect for the family, having slides and a mini lazy river. The hot tub is very massaging and relaxing. The 6 inch sections of the pool are great for toddlers and young children. I do recommend this hotel for families staying in Fredericksburg."

I can honestly say that this is by far one of the better Holiday Inn Express' that I've ever stayed in! It's immaculate, the pool is LOVELY and having a pool view room made our stay even better. My husband loved the free cookies lol and I loved all the space we had plus the breakfast and mini fridge + microwave in the room. It's very close to Main St. and perfect proximity to the wineries. Will absolutely stay here again."

We just laid out by the pool and swam for 4 hours before getting ready to go to dinner at Rathskeller on Main St. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious.

                "description": "After driving 400 miles across Texas we ended up in the tiny German town of Fredericksburg, which is somewhere in between no-where and no-where.  A hidden gem, a lifesaver hotel that we found by recommendation of a friend and luckily took the last room in town. I've never been so thankful to find a room because there is nothing but roach motels in between this place and Carlsbad Caverns.  If you're going to stay in Fredricksburg stay here!   We were driving until midnight when we went out of our way to make this stop and although we didn't stay long we enjoyed the clean modern room, with nice amenities and friendly service.    The highlight was the fabulous spread they offered for breakfast.  Lots of hot food and drinks. Plenty of places to sit with nice views of the tropical pool. Pastries, yogurt, fruit, cereal, oatmeal, tea, coffee, juice, eggs, bacon, pancakes. Yum!  There's a Pacific war museum not far from the hotel and a quaint old town corridor with lots of antique shops and boutiques. Not to mention, this is \"hill country\" so you'll find wineries and lavender fields within an hour. Festivals, farmers markets and little eateries too. So its a definite touristy spot for those who are driving thru to stop and enjoy."

Rex picked us up at our Airbnb and reserved us tastings at 3 different wineries. He had great advice on which wineries we should visit and they were timed and spaced out great. He organized a boxed lunch for us before our first winery and provided water throughout the day. At the end of the trip, we already were wanting to plan our next trip out to Fredericksburg and use him again! Rex went above and beyond for us and was so personable!!! This was by far the best trip to Fredericksburg we have had thanks to Rex and 19th Hole Wine Tours!!"

                "description": "I booked a wine tour with Rex and 19th Hole Wine Tours for my baby sister's bachelorette party this past weekend.  There were 11 of us girls and everyone agreed the tour and Rex were fantastic!  From first contact Rex as helpful and professional.  He recommended wineries that were good for our size group and that would have great photo ops (a very important thing for our bride to be).  The sandwich shop Rex got us lunch from was delicious as well.  On the tour Rex was personable and full of information.  The tour bus was clean and professional inside and out.  I hadn't been to Fredericksburg in about 9 years and so much had changed.  The main street was bigger with more places to shop and eat and according to Rex, there were ten times the amount of wineries (from 6 to 60)!  We started with Pedernales, which is a personal favorite of mine because the wine is delicious and the place is calm and classy with a great porch area.  Here the tasting was fixed and we all tasted the same 8 wines. Rex secured us a private tasting room here and we got to keep the glasses which was nice.  Next we went to 4.0 Cellars (a Rex recommended stop) which had a bunch a great tasting options. I also learned that this winery gets wines from 3 different wine makers and changes its selection menus monthly.  We had lunch here in the beautiful outdoor space where there was live music.  The next stop at Southold Farm and Cellar was everyone's favorite by far though.  This was recommended by Rex for its spectacular views and it did not disappoint!  Located at the top of a high hill, this small single room tasting house had the best view and ambiance of any winery I have ever been to.  The tasting room had large windows on every wall giving great views during our tasting.  The wine maker's father did our tasting and told endearing stories about the family and the wine making.  The wines were not my cup of tea for the most part, but I always like to try new types of wine.  Oh and the dog there is amazing.  His name is Waldo and he was happy to pose for all the photos we wanted with him.  The back porch here has several porch swings faced toward the best views in Fredericksburg.  Southold is a must see!  Finally, we went Fat Ass Winery and Ranch, a selection of mine.  The wine here was not good in my opinion, but if you want a lively party this is the place to be!  The atmosphere is upbeat and full of life.  No sniffing the bouquet or wine spit buckets at Fat Ass.  No way!  I did like their frozen wine though.  Book a tour with Rex and 19th Hole Wine Tours and you cannot go wrong!"

Picked us up and dropped us back off at our lodge.  A great (and I do mean great) picnic lunch.  We will definitely return for another tour!  This was wine touring at its finest!  Thank you Rex!"

I just got back from celebrating my bachelorette weekend in Fredericksburg with all of best friends and the highlight of our trip was our tour day with Steve!  The bus was so perfect - clean, well stocked with snacks and cold water, and lots of A/C.  Steve was such a treat to have with us throughout the day!  I would highly recommend Reserve Tours and Steve.  Next time in town, I will be using them again!"

Even though we ended up with a rainy day she went above and beyond to make it extra special. Loved the wineries and the fun atmosphere on the bus! Some of the group it was their first time in Fredericksburg and they were so impressed with Reserve tours. We will always be back! Thanks again Leigh for a fun day!!"

                "description": "Austin is 100% as good as it gets. My fiancé thought there were not tours on weekdays, and he was wrong. IF YOU NEED WEEKDAY TOURS, AUSTIN IS YOUR GUY. I'm sure he is fantastic on the weekend as well, but he is definitely your go-to during the week.  We called him the day before, and he was able to meet our needs personally. He's incredibly knowledgable and friendly. I can't explain how much better he personally made the day. We are newbies to the area, and he had personal recommendations. He even knew where to get pairings at the last minute.  Once he found out I was a Cab drinker, he took us to a wine tasting he had not been to previously, and he was super positive and excited with us the whole way.   Everyone we interacted with seemed to know Austin, and I completely understand why.   His car was luxury at its finest. He let us choose our music station, had ample room for way more people (up to around 13, which we didn't need, but in case you do) and had snacks along the way. He offered to let us drink any wine we chose in the car as well.  His wife even had a hand-signed letter for us in the car, which was thoughtful and beautiful. I really could not have asked for more out of a tasting day. I would 100% recommend Austin and his service to anyone, and I can't wait to contact him the next time we are in town.  Also, on top of it all, Austin took photos of us, and plenty of them, even without us asking. He even convinced my fiancé to take some great ones, and these are memories I now have forever.   Austin, thanks for making our vacation that much more special. We'll see you again!"

The luxury bus was awesome, great sound system and came with snacks. Chris, our concierge/driver was lovely, a real gentleman, and helped us navigate at each vineyard.   My guests and I had a terrific day."

Leigh was wonderful in helping me to organize the tour and pick the best wineries to visit. The sprinter bus was very clean and had Bluetooth for us to play music from our phones. I will definitely use Reserve Tours again and recommend to family and friends!"
