                "description": "Ah man, we really wish that we loved this place better than we did. We came here on Sunday with our two friends and their kids for the first time and the space is just gorgeous: lovely old oak trees, plenty of open space and tables, a little area with slides for the kids to run around and enjoy.  That's where the compliments stop. Everything else about our experience was wanting, starting with the GRUMPY woman who helped us at the bar. We ordered the burger--they were out (thanks for letting us know!). The winter smash cocktail tasted like it had zero whiskey in it and was poured from a spout. The IPA on draft was fine. The food that we did end up getting was only OK. The cucumber salad was runny and mealy, and the chopped brisket sandwich seemed like it could have been tasty that morning but by 5-whatever pm, it was dry as hell. We also didn't get the BBQ sauce that it was served with (our friends did for theirs). Our kid's quesadilla was standard. And bagged chips galore!  Also, they close at 6:00 pm. On a Sunday before a holiday. OK, fine, bad business, but you do you! Here's what's not cool: coming over to our table hot and heavy and telling us you're closing in five minutes with an attitude and demanding our food trays. We're happy to be accommodating! You just don't need to be jerks about it. If you've had a long day and just can't handle the customer service, then have enough self-awareness to ask a coworker to do the corralling.  Honestly, we went over to Fitzhugh afterwards which had good food (desserts at least), better service, a better play area for the kids, and we had way more fun there. We'd love to try Treaty Oak again, but we need to have enough time to forget the less savory aspects of our experience."

                "description": "Good liquor and good atmosphere. As mentioned, plenty of space to spread out.   However, there's no simple way to just stop by to pick up a bottle. Even if you're not buying a mixed drink or anything that requires work other than handing you a bottle and paying for it you have to stand in the line that's serving cocktails and drinks.   Further, when you do get service, it's been rather dismissive the last few times we went. Expect to spend time there- no way to quickly pop in, grab merch and a bottle and leave."

                "description": "Took my second trip out to treaty oak and was not disappointed with the day spent here. Treaty Oak is the kind of place that you want to spend the entire day at, and you totally can! What I love about it too is that it's a massive space with so much to do while on the grounds. It even has a playground where the kids can play, and an indoor space with plenty of TVs to watch football on game day.  We started off with a tasting, which you can either do Gin or Whiskey. I actually highly recommend the tasting, it's only $10 a person but gives some great background on how each different flavor/bottle is created and made. You also can put the $10 towards a bottle if you end up wanting to buy one to take home.  We then went into the bar area and got drinks, which is a huge variety of cocktails! They have plenty of picnic tables, and multiple boards for cornhole on the grounds. The restaurant on site it BBQ and was amazing! We got the brisket sandwich and pork sandwich and loved them both. What I also loved about it, was that there's multiple places where you can get drinks, foods, etc. on the grounds but your tab stays open for everything. Love this place and highly recommend making a day trip out of it if you haven't been!"

We had the white sangria... which was just perfect for a summer afternoon with some brisket nachos that were yum yum yum! The kiddo had a blueberry lemonade with mac n cheese that disappeared in so little time. He couldn't stop exclaiming how good it was.  We'll definitely be back to try out the cocktail bar for a date night.  They didn't have live music but they were playing music of varying genre throughout the evening. Great way to relax and leave your stresses behind."

                "description": "Treaty Oak Distillery in Dripping Springs is a great Texas distillery getting most things to make their bourbon and gin from around Texas. It has great covered patios and outdoor space throughout the property with a delicious restaurant- Alice's Restaurant, a tasting room, and a covered bar/lounge as well as an outdoor stage and small playground. We did the tour and tasting which allowed us to see the inner workings of the distillery. Cody was an excellent tour guide answering all our random questions as he showed us around the distillery. And I bought an old barrel, which I have wanted in my house for quite some time. I would highly recommend you get over there...today! Such a great time. Thanks Treaty Oak!!"

                "description": "I want to give this business a better review but unfortunately they had some major issues.  We went last weekend on Sunday and there was a sign to scan the QR code the for menu, we waited in a long line to order food, once everyone got to the cashier she told us that only the brunch menu was being served (it was like 2pm or something).   So everyone had to quickly change their order!   Talk about poor communication!! It should say on the menu very clearly what's being served.   Then, I tried to order vegetarian nachos but my cashier told me they were sold out of beans and that I should just get chips and queso instead, so I did. THEN my brother in law who ordered after me got his nachos which were vegetarian bean nachos (not meat like he ordered). I said \"they told me they were sold out!\" Again, bad communication.  Then, my brother in law ordered sangria and got a big pitcher, my dad went to order the same thing and they gave him HALF the size. So weird and confusing.   This place seems very confused internally and each worker seems to have their own message.  Also nothing for gluten-free vegans on the menu."

                "description": "Another great distillery to add to the list when in Dripping Springs! This place is huge and perfect for a group or date or even solo! So much space for you, your kids, and your dog! Bring the family! LoL  It was actually recommended to me at my last stop, and I love me some bourbon and whiskey so it was a no brainer. However, if bourbon isn't your thing they also have options for the gin, vodka and non alcoholic lovers in your group! Something for everyone I'd say!   That being said, I took off a star mostly because the line was stupid long. They definitely could have, and should have had more than just one single file line for us to get a drink, I spent half my time in line.   That being said though, once I got my drink and was able to enjoy the drink and the vibe it was great! They have live music and a restaurant if you get hungry and I ended up getting the day tripper drink! I loved it, it was so good. I will definitely be back!"

If you don't get the brisket nachos, you're making the biggest mistake of your life. But don't eat too much, or you'll be too full for the delicious drinks!   The vibe is relaxed, the food feels almost TOO good for the rustic setting and the live music is pure Texas charm. I could stay here all day!"

                "description": "The grounds are very nice. Plenty of room to spread out. Lots of picnic tables available in the shade. A playground. The food at the restaurant was pretty decent, if a little expensive. The staff inside the restaurant are very friendly, but it all seems very inefficient.  The reason for the 3 star review is really that both of the drinks we ordered were cocktails that are premade and then dispensed. They were....ok? A little too sweet and a lot too weak. I couldn't taste the whiskey/bourbon in either of them. For $9/drink at a distillery, I just expected better drinks made to order and I left feeling disappointed. If we had known the drinks we ordered were batch cocktails, we would have tried to order something else, but there was nothing on the menu to denote that."

I'd been invited out there for a friends birthday and the idea of heading all the way to Dripping Springs on a hot Saturday afternoon to try bourbon (which in general all tastes like burning to me) wasn't really my idea of a great time. Man, I was wrong. First off, they have a wide selection of spirits, everything from gin and vodka to wine and beer. The setting is bucolic with wide open spaces and clusters of shade trees. A friendly staff, great bbq (try the brisket nachos) and some tasty signature cocktails (try the Pineapple Express) made for a great afternoon that turned into a lovely evening. Did I mention they also had live music? I will be back."

Just about 30-40 minutes outside of Austin lies this beautiful distillery. There's so much space and more than enough seating but even on the weekends this place can get pretty busy. As for food you can expect Texas bbq from this place as I tried both the brisket and Turkey which were both very good. If your not a booze person they also have their own in house wines and beer but if you do like a good cocktail I'd recommend hill country dreaming. Im anticipating come back here to check this place out in the evening for some live music or Sunday brunch!"

Parking was ample and so were the picnic tables! We didn't do a tour but put our name in for lunch at the restaurant, Alice's. It was about a thirty minute wait on a Saturday around 1, which really went unnoticed because we just grabbed drinks at the Cocktail Bar and sat in the open seating area until they called us saying it was ready. There was live music, lots of space and tables , cornhole, and you could go do a distillery tour too.   The bartenders were helpful in finding a gluten free drink option for me, as well as our waitress at Alice's. Our waitress was especially friendly and attentive--didn't get her name but a recent HS grad going to UT! She made sure to ask about gluten and dairy free options for me, and there were plentiful. Everyone devoured their food and were happily satisfied. I had a delicious club sandwich on gluten free bread with some salt and pepper chips. SO good. I also loved the white sangria.   All in all, I am so glad we found it and the bride said it was the perfect way to spend our day. We definitely will be back!"

Ended at the tasting room and we had a chance to try a number of really great flavors. Also had some cocktails. The manhattan was a bit weak and watered down but the old fashioned is very good. A but on the sweet side but still delicious.   We then went down to their restaurant and had food and drinks. The bbq is very good. Brisket is a little more moist than i would want so i would recommend the turkey and ribs. Very good. The chips and queso are also delicious.   We ended with the bourbon pecan pie. Truthfully it was not all that special. I love pecan pie and this was a bit of a letdown. Not sure where these come from but store bought would be better. These were a bit bland and under whelming.   Property is beautiful. Great place to go and hang out and relax, get a cool drink and enjoy some music on a cool day."

Talon, our tour guide was so knowledgeable, engaging and witty. We started with drinks prior to the tour and Miley was so outgoing and welcoming. The follow up lunch and drinks topped off the afternoon. The food was delicious and our server Jake was so accommodating. Everyone enjoyed the beautiful grounds and tried their luck with the cornhole boards. It became a bit of a competition! The group said the day was superb and the quality of the gin rivaled the best from across the pond."

                "description": "Dripping Springs Distilling is just now opening its spanking new tasting room, patios, entertainment venue and production facility, and it is splendid. I went there four years ago, when the tasting room was essentially the lobby to the distillery. While I great.y appreciated what they were doing with their gins and vodkas, the ambience was like drinking in the lobby of Atscott manufacturing in Pine City, Minnesota. This new facility reshuffles the entire deck.  It has taken them a while to complete, but it was worth it. The new venue is spectacular -- well designed, comfortably modern, spacious and welcoming. It's not only a tasting room, it's also a credible restaurant with an interesting menu, specials, and a exceptionally friendly staff.  We went on the second weekend of the 'soft 'opening', but they seemed to have already worked all the kinks out. They were welcoming and prompt and attentive. Our server, Jack, went out of his way to answer questions, including about plantings on the grounds and ingredients in the dishes, and to offer suggestions about cocktails.   I had the street taco daily special and an Electric Lady cocktail. My companion had the jalapeño cornbread muffins and a French 75. The street tacos were small but fully packed. The spice mix could have been spicier,  it then I like hot. The flavors though were indeed special. Nothing dominated, so you could appreciate the protein and still enjoy the comity cheese and the light drizzle of sour cream. The tortillas were a bit small, but you expect that in a street taco. My friends jalapeño corn muffins were excellent. A well constructed corn muffin with one slice of jalapeño that came up and kicked your butt on the after palate. There were plenty of them, so we took lots home for later. The regular entre menu is interesting enough (two different pot pies, additional comfort type foods) that I'll be back.  I should not forget the flight of spirits. I've always respected their two gins, and I often buy them as they are available at Twin and Specs. Very solid, unpretentious and well crafted. I'm not a vodka guy, but my friend liked their offerings. Their 1876 bourbon still needs some maturation and work though. But such is the case with whiskey.   The full grand opening is coming up, with all the hoopla expected. Once the noise is past, Dripping Springs Distilling, with its multiple brands and spirits, will be a destination you'll want to add to the itinerary."

We booked a tour, which turned out to be very informative and Talon was a great guide!  The only (teeny) downfall of the tour was the distillery was operational that day and was a little noisy and difficult to hear our guide.  We enjoyed a cocktail and lunch on the patio.  I had the Basil Sour and my husband had an Old Fashioned.  We both had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Everything was delicious!"

You walk to see the stills and they do a quick run through on how they make their vodka and gin. You can see how they soak the herbs for the gin and how they do their bottling. It was interesting to learn how labor intensive their orange vodka is to make since they hand zest the orange rinds.   Obviously, the highlight is the tasting. You get to sample their vodkas, gins, and their brand new 1876 bourbon.   All in all a fun tour and tasting. I was super happy to get the last bottle of their first release batch of their 1876 bourbon after the tasting and the gal doing the tasting was great as well.   For $11 you get the tour, tasting, and a shot glass."

We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

                "description": "Finally decided to take a day trip down to dripping springs and had to finally stop at Desert Door. To start, this place is designed so beautifully. I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Great patio vibes: chill, mist fans going , and live music about to start. Inside is nice too, super clean and cute/trendy.   The sotol is great and their cocktails are delicious, as well as unique. Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero. Hubs got the ranch water (served in a Topo Chico, gotta love that)!   Nicole our waitress and Erin the bartender are solid assets at this establishment! Thank y'all for a great Saturday afternoon!"

And they sure know how to do a cocktail, too! I got the River Rita and it legit blew my mind.   Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.   The staff was also astoundingly friendly and the kind of people you want to hang out with."

Love these folks and I know some day we'll go out there and there will be a wait, for now it's still somewhat of an unknown. We've only had wonderful cocktails and bought several bottles of Sotol from them. I like that it has less carbs than tequila! Anyway, the choice of food truck out there is solid (Eden).  I wish I could live next door!"

Very unique sotol experience, I want to say they are the only distillery in the states, but could be wrong! Very nice outside space, they have a food truck with some very good food! It is a bit of a drive but worth the trek. Had a lovely time here and would certainly come back! Just have to be careful on not enjoying too many beverages as it is a drive!!"

                "description": "Finally I was able to make it out to the distillery with my good friend early on a Saturday so that we could get some direct tasting vodka notes from Deep Eddy themselves rather than me taking shots at bars around Austin.  Parking was easy for us but do note that we showed up around 11:20AM on a Saturday so we didn't have any issues.  The later you arrive parking could be a thing and you may have to wait/stalk someone who is leaving to get a spot. Also as the day got later there were many buses and charter vans parked in the front and roundabout chilling out as the company they are driving around are inside getting down too.  Cocktails in a paper cup runs $8 with plenty to choose from the menu that is thoughtfully laid out in sweet, sours, spicy, etc. A nice mason jar with the Deep Eddy logo is $12 and slightly larger.  Do know that they will not refill your mason jar after you buy your first one so be prepared to be clanking around the distillery with your extra mason jars if you keep going the $12 route. Also be careful with your glass too - I saw many people let that mason jar slip out of their hands and the mason jar just crash on the concrete floor. So sad! Also frozen drinks / cocktails can only be purchased downstairs so be ready to wait in a little line if it is busy.   Loved the areas to sit inside the tasting room and even in the 2nd large downstairs area.  The pillows, decor, and the small touches around the sitting areas on the first floor are super cute and selfie-worthy.  I can imagine in the winter, with the large fireplace going, this space is cozy AF!  We didn't go outside at all as it was super hot in July but it looked like there are plenty of tables, shade, and seating for some large groups both in the front, side, and back areas.  After 2 cocktails in a mason jar we were feeling a good buzz and knowing we still had to trek back home (south Austin) we cut it off there. By the time we left around 2pm the place was buzzing with people, all 3 bars had 10+ waiting to be served, and I wasn't planning on waiting to close my tab in a long line.  I was super surprised to find out you can close your tab at the merch area with the cashier there so don't fret and add in that mug, stickers, shirts, bar additions, and Deep Eddy cool pool lady in red signage to your basket to check out while you close out your tab. You will save yourself some time and be out of there in a jiffy!  We plan to come back especially now knowing they are opened on Thursdays at 11am!!!!"

My favorite is probably the peach vodka and they have many cocktails to choose from. We went on a Sunday where there were local vendors there too as well as live music. Head to Dripping Springs for the great tasting room. Unfortunately, the distillery near Buda is not one that is open to the public, so the tasting room is where to go."

                "description": "Like I was saying earlier, I find tasting rooms gimmicky and this one is a perfect example of it.   We chose to come here because I have deep respect for Deep Eddy as a company for their commitment and contributions to the local community. They've gone above and beyond again and again. Respect!  The tasting room is a large hall, with flights consisting of tiny cups of flavored vodka. You don't taste the actual spirit because the fruity flavors are so sweet.   The \"Colombian\" food options on-site is a joke. It's an old school concession stand (movie theater of the 80s style) with heat lamps keeping nacho chips warm on a folding table. Don't expect tacos or empanadas.  The space, both indoors and outdoor, is quite large. And they have a cute performance stage inside.  We stayed a total of 15 minutes."

Bartenders are very friendly and fast but the drinks are simply made and during Covid they are all touching the mint in their hands by smacking it. Id rather a gentle crush/roll in a glass... felt a bit gross (others commented too).  Wish there was live music Saturday afternoon at 4  Games outside like giant connect 4 etc  Parking- gets full on weekends so a bit tight  The decor was cute  Sheriff at the door to handle anyone getting a little too cray"

The set-up is gorgeous and feels so clean when you walk in. You get a behind the scenes taste of where the best Texas vodka comes from. The staff was kind and knowledgeable. They answered any questions we had about the drinks. I ordered a $10 flight and my Husband got the Orange dreamcicle drink. You have the option to get your drink in a mason jar as a keep sake.  There is a great gift shop on site, so we got matching shirts because we are cheesy like that.  There was a delicious food truck out front that had Vegan and Meat Eater options available. I like that they cater to both.   There is so much to do in the surrounding area. We went thrifting and enjoyed the nature that Hill Country has to offer."

We are already big fans of Deep Eddy's vodka and all of their flavors, so we had no doubt we would enjoy our time there. The cocktails they serve at their bar are innovative and refreshing.

Other than drinking, there's not much else to do here, but it's definitely a lively place to enjoy a drink with friends!

The weather was perfect and they have a nice little patio area. The spot is family friendly meaning you can bring your kids, but there isn't a lot for them to do except run around in the patio area. I would have liked if the patio area was fenced off and not open to the parking so I could relax a bit more. I had to keep a close eye to make sure my kid didn't wander off. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tasted and would definitely stop in here to explore more of the tastings, but will likely leave the kid at home next time."

FINALLY this past weekend we got there when they were open! Oh we were so excited and the place lived up to the hype. The seating atmosphere both inside and out is very roomy and comfortable. All the staff is friendly and easy-going. Everywhere including the bathrooms were incredibly clean. The cocktails... the cocktails are downright amazing. They're inventive, delicious, and fresh. You're going to have a hard decision to make no matter what kind of drinks you like... I actually ended up ordering two at once because I couldn't decide! On the way out, we stopped at their little gift shop and man do they pack that area with goodies! Talk about variety and options. The shirts are awesome and made very well to boot, and they have tons of other merch. I left with a soft tanktop, a wicked fun tin can that I plan on using for a cactus or succulent vase, a magnet, and a collapsible dog bowl! We'll be back every chance we get. Loved it, loved everything, love the vodka."

The whole group willingly gave our ID's for inspection and the birthday girl's ID was \"questionable\", so she was taken to a cop car by a Sheriff, put in the back and questioned.  While Maddy was at the cop car getting her ID verified, the rest of the group had our full drinks/cups (that we paid for and were able to take home), snatched out of our hands. We all requested a refund for the drinks and were denied??  After the Sherriff verified that Maddy's ID was real, the manager proceeded to threaten tresspassing charges against us??   I have never experienced anything like this and would love to be contacted/reimbursed for the mistake that was clearly made."

I will preface that this whole COVID thing has still, for some reason, has some still on edge.  However, this place has taken it to new heights.  While the great state of Texas has opened to 100%, this place seems to have missed that memo.  We literally got yelled it for actually standing up at our tables and told that if we do stand to have a mask on.  Additionally, we got yelled at for moving a table.  The guys exact words were \"I'm picky where our furniture is placed.\"  Additionally, if you want to get a beverage, you actually have to MAKE A RESERVATION just to go in get one.  That is ridiculous!  By the way, the Hays County police are on site to enforce all of this over-the-top nonsense.  Most of us stayed for a single drink and then left for better and more fun pastures.  It's obvious that this place has forgotten all about who the consumer is and how we should be treated.  Not only will we never go back, but I am never going to purchase any of their products again.  By the way...the Jeep community here in Texas is very tight-knit and we will talk..."

He cares deeply about this country and is willing to defend it even in the face of a lousy subpoena issued to him by Cheney's witch hunt from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Jeez. Why don't these libtards give up already! They should instead enjoy a refreshing beverage from the establishment owned by Colonel Phil Waldron. A man who realized the election was rigged and had constructed a plan for throwing out the results. What an American hero!!"

I can't really comment on their beer other than to say, the three I tried were not to my liking, but what I can say is that I love this place!  I've been here twice now, with friends, and with my man and both times have been great!  The place is spacious and covered in tree canopies with a sprinkle of fire pits, Adirondack chairs and picnic tables. The service is good and the mules are divine. I love that they serve cocktails as well as beer so there is something that I like and something for the beer drinkers, like my boo.   We were lucky on both occasions to have great weather and this time around, live music. I've been to several of the breweries and distilleries along Fitzhugh and so far, this is my favorite."

I snagged a raddler which was a little different to a traditional one, but delicious and dangerous as you can probably down 6 before the Lord almighty gets the news.   The brew house and distillery are open and outside seating is abundant.   Bring your 4-legged friends for the ride as they are super dog friendly!!!!  You would have to be drunk and mad to pass this place when visiting Dripping Springs. Wait...they might be able to take care of that for you...responsibly of course.   So. Great drinks? Check.

Otherwise I probably would not come back here, the drink I got was literally all syrup and made me extremely sick to where we had to leave... Kind of completely ruined the day. My boyfriend enjoyed the drink he ordered, which I believe was the hurricane. They have a wing food truck that you can order from, unfortunately we didn't get to try it because the drink made me so sick. We plan to go back in try the wings and will review the wing food truck. Great location for the spot, nice and relaxing... Just be careful what you order and avoid anything that has syrup in it."

They are presently distilling rum and vodka and brewing several varieties of beer.  My spouse tried a Big Red One with salt -- a vodka drink -- and a Cuba Libre.  She was pleased with both. I had their amber and liked it so much I had another.  They have a clever solution to social distancing. The two young, friendly order takers are stationed under a canopy at the edge of the parking lot by their outside seating. You place your order with them, and one goes inside to fetch your drinks. There are plenty of shade trees and picnic benches so it's a pleasant experience. The owner , Phil, came out to say hi to a fellow vet (me). Nice, congenial guy.  The Dripping Wings food truck is stationed there now, so I went back for an order for dinner. Excellent wings, particularly the Asian sweet and spicy.  Glad to have a new convenient venue to enjoy."

Glad we stopped at this place after seeing a sign off the side of the road and following a winding path down to see this gem.  Very homey vibes with a great patio for outdoor seeing that just has a fantastic view of the hill country. Decently priced drinks consisting of either gin or vodka.  Seating is pretty limited inside, but the outdoor space is just amazing and honestly makes the experience really that much better. I'd highly recommend 'The Bullfrog' with vodka. Tasty drink, but not overpowering and has a nice kick (smooth vodka that doesn't burn like gasoline).  P.S. They have some cool looking merch! Make sure to take a look at their terrariums...they are wicked!"

However, this time I made a trip purposefully to stop in.  I am glad I did.  Frog Pond is a family-owned business and passion project. The entire family was behind the bar the day my friend and I stopped in except for mom and I think a daughter.  The family owns the land and has slowly overtime built the tasting room and production area themselves.  They currently make a vodka and gin.  They offered us a free sip of each to determine which we would prefer in one of their handcrafted cocktails.  Both had a nice flavor profile that blends well in cocktails.  Their cocktails were creative and they mentioned the family came up with the recipes together.  The cocktails were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Their space has a fun modern 50's theme.  They have an outdoor patio you can sit back and relax on a nice day."

We were debating between here and Deep Eddy, and we picked here for a more off the beaten path option and chill atmosphere. And we were definitely not disappointed. The staff were very helpful and welcoming and knowledgeable about their product. Outdoor seating is spacious with impressive views. Cocktails were highly affordable and very tasty. Unfortunately, tours were closed due to COVID, but we hope we can come back for tours some time soon!"

                "description": "What a beautiful facility!  Stopped in for their grand opening and was amazed at such a sparkling clean, friendly place.  It's very obvious that a lot of careful thought has gone into this place. The actual distillery is incredible. The whole place is just beautiful. Even on a scorching Texas Summer day, there's a strong breeze out on the porch.  It's a very \"Austin-esque\" type place, down-home and friendly. Although I don't drink, my wife enjoyed a cocktail very much and we bought a bottle to take home. They had some nice lemonade and infused water for me too.  Great design of the logo, bottles and everything. Really worth stopping in if you're in the area or just feel like a nice drive from Austin."

Has an area to play games out front, and indoor and outdoor seating."

We started off at another well known distillery down the road and googled what else was close by and found this awesome little spot with a great view. They make small batches of vodka and gin at the distillery and make a few different drinks to try. Their porch was a great place to hang out while playing giant jenga and relaxing. I noticed cornhole as we walked in as well. We watched deer randomly wandering in the distance. The drink I had was great, a cranberry vodka fizz, so I had another. The indoor space is fairly small and the patio could fit maybe 30 people comfortably. It was not crowded at all when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. We'll go again next time we're in Austin!"

I am very happy to say that the product that they are offering, not only the liquor, is amazing. They couldn't have picked a better location to place their distillery. The hills of Texas, day or night, make relaxing on the patio with the variety of gin and vodka cocktails that much more relaxing. The bright pops of color when you venture inside of the distillery are such a delight and really made my girlfriend and I feel happy to be in such a welcoming place.   The gin was delicious and I plan to buy more bottles very soon. Don't think that my lack of praise for the vodka means that it isn't good (I am just not a fan of vodka..rough nights in college) but I definitely suggesting venturing out to this family run, local organization. You will not be disappointed."

The bar tender seemed to be really put out that we were even there.  Didn't welcome us, when we asked if we needed to go to the register part of the bar to order,  he looked at his phone and rudely said, I'll be with you in a min. Then continued to be annoyed that he had to take our order. The place was empty only 1 pinter group of 4 so wasn't like he was super busy.  They even said he didn't really seem to want to be there and definitely didn't want to be taking our orders.  The AC was also very lacking we were all fanning ourselves with the menu which seemed to be the best use of the menu since he didn't want to serve us. The sink in the women's bathroom barley had water coming out if it and they were out of toliet paper but we dare not ask the 1 bar tender as that would have really put him over the top. I wouldn't recommend this place and if I was the owner I'd want to know how bad my employee is. No wonder there was no one inside."

It'll be a great space to spend an afternoon once the pandemic ends.  Call ahead if you want to pick up some of their fabulous Texas Holiday Nog, but remember, only 2 bottles per person per month.  Careful though and drink responsibly. This is not your father's Oldsmobile eggnog. It will sneak up on you and kicks you in the noggin like a freakin' mule."

                "description": "We passed by this place heading to the Drip yesterday and since I'd never heard of it, I immediately yelped it.  A new distillary only about 10 minutes from my Casa?  Hell yes, I'm curious.  And I'll admit I became even more curiouser after reading Arian's review....I intended to ask them about this \"one of the best after-hours swingers hangouts in Austin!!!\" sitch.    The tasting room was a little hard to find as it's around the back of this little warehouse strip but it's open and spacious and we were only the 2nd couple there on a Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and bellied up to the bar.  Our bartender (and all the staff I think) are in the Stinson family.  She was very friendly and gave us all the history of the place and explained each tasting in length.  They are currently offering a tasting of 4 of their liquors for $7 (these served quaintly in communion cups) and have cocktails they can serve as well.  We sampled everything (of course), the vodka, the white rum and dark rum, the elderflower liquor (think St Germaine) and the Holiday Nog.  She also threw in a sampling of their Bailey's style coffee liquor that's not quite \"ready\" yet.  I immediately fell in love with the Holiday Nog, which doesn't actually have any egg in it (thank goodness) and is made more with rum than whiskey (again, thank goodness).  This will go great with holiday gatherings.  I will keep an eye on their FB page for release of that coffee liquor!  All of their bottles run in the $25 range.  Hubby and I each had a cocktail, him the mojito and me the Citrus Fizz, and both were made well and were tasty.  We also bought several of their cocktail glasses as they are sturdy heavy glass, perfect for Bourbon.  Which, btw, they are still perfecting their whiskey recipe and will offer that in the future as well.    We really enjoyed talking to everyone and after getting a little liquid courage, I did ask about the swinger's parties.  She laughed and said that was just a friend making jokes....I wonder......"

I was also really intrigued by the damiana, and generally enjoyed the cocktails we tried. also, was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen food was also quite good. all in all if I lived here I'd hang out on the weekends."

Tried to go to Jester King down the road (and didn't get to, for the 2nd time in a row cause it's always so damn busy) so decided to go here instead. Glad we did! They were very attentive to us as soon as we came in, and we loved the complimentary tasting flight. Ended up buying a bottle of the coffee liquor we can't find at the liquor store. And I love the virgin pineapple drink they made for my toddler. Matt was fantastic! Very attentive, not pushy. Good vibes all around."

The tasting was free, while the cocktails were in the $8-10 range. The gin, coffee liqueur and pecan liqueur were amazing! However, because it was Sunday, we couldnt buy bottles, which was very disappointing. The cocktails were a bit of a let down that didnt let the spirits shine. The best was the gingery take on a White Russian. The service was very friendly and attentive, yet again, we were the only customers. I definitely recommend picking up a bottle of their gin and liqueurs if you can find them!"

When we answered no they immediately brought over for a tasting - no charge.  We enjoyed most of the different offerings.  Then we picked out some cocktails to enjoy - both with their gin.  Daughters was with grapefruit and mine with cucumber.  We also purchased a cheese plate which we were told was made up for them from the local grocery store.  Nonetheless, we enjoyed our cocktails out on the picnic tables and had quite a lovely time.    Not being from Texas we were unaware of the law prohibiting liquor sales on Sundays.  We certainly would have bought a bottle if  we could have."

The area is pretty small, so it's not ideal for big groups, but don't let that deter you. After our tasting, they offered us a free cocktail. If you're a fan of coffee, you must try their cafecito or chocolate cafecito spirit. My favorite was their gin. If you like mezcal, try to their gin reserve in mezcal barrel. Definitely a must when you're in the area"

This place is really amazing!! There was quite a bit of crowd as it was saturday but we were still given a great deal of attention during our tasting! My favorite was the cafecito coffee liquer and the chocolate cafecito. They're so good, that I could probably drink an entire bottle all by myself!  The best part of this place is the amazing people who own/work here and they didn't even charge us for the tastings and also gave us a free cocktail made with their gin!! So as appreciation from our end for all that they did and shared with us, we gave a nice tip :)!! Definitely, going to look for Revolution on my next trip to Spec's!"

Best of all there was no need to pay $$ upfront for a tour--just walk in and start tasting and talking.   The gin was the standout here, but all the stuff we tried was excellent except for their own cherry-limeade mixer--that was kind of a letdown, but the alcohol itself was great.   Can easily walk from here to Last Stand Brewing and Argus Cidery. There was a food truck outside as well."

To elaborate, samples were provided for the different options of their distilled liquor while an explanation of the flavors was provided, which was particularly beneficial for the 100 proof gin such has notes of grapefruit, lavender, and juniper. They also have a coffee liquour which is 50 proof, so a bit stronger than the traditional but still very sweet and flavorful. Even after the tasting, it was a nice place to hang out and was well ventilated and shaded."

We were given samples of gin, amaro, and two coffee liqueurs.  All were very good.  We then picked our cocktails, which he made and brought to our table.  Very tasty and reasonably priced.  We were not rushed out and time was not even mentioned by the owner.  I realized it was 15 min. after closing so we finished our drinks and bought some small size bottles.  We will be back!"

Upon visiting, we found their doors swung open to a single long room that had spirit-making equipment and two booths set up.  At the first booth, we had complimentary tastings and a saga-sharing session with their amiable bartender. The tastings were amazing: their hibiscus gin and tonic cocktail was incredible (the taste you crave days afterward). After the tasting, you can meander on to taste some of their specialty liquors (fruity ones too). We found their eau de vivre to be phenomenal, lovely aroma and as smooth as butter. Would highly recommend stashing oodles of their spirits away for safekeeping!"

The whiskey was delicious, the tasting room/patio didn't disappoint, and Daniel even spent some time chatting. Still blown away by the experience."

I had seen the videos on YouTube, and I had some time before my flight out of Austin, so I drove up on a Friday, had a cigar while I waited for the place to open (they have seating for cigar smoking on the porches!), and then sampled some of their wares.  It's excellent, and I really can't say more than that.  Try the whiskey neat, or in a drink - everything we tried was wonderful."

We had a large group, but the bartender was not bothered with us at all. She made some great recommendations. I opted for the Bloody Mary as I'd never had one with whiskey before. It was flavored perfectly.   The ambiance is a classy casual - be sure to check out the cute little room in the back. I grabbed a comfy chair and perused the book selection, finding some really good reads. I could see myself setting back there with a cocktail and a book for hours.

The staff is super friendly, too. The cocktails are reasonably priced and you can buy bottles to take home.   We were here on a Saturday afternoon and it was chilly outside so we stayed inside, but there was a nice seating area outside. There was also a really wonderful Bluegrass band upstairs that was playing while we were there. So here are 2 levels, but the second isn't really accessible when a band is there. Totally worth having the band play, though.  Definitely will be back at this place. We are all from Austin and it's a super easy drive to get out here. Great for people to add to their winery tour."

New to the Wimberly area Andalusia is a welcome addition focusing on Whiskey and helping break the overpopulated brewery scene.  Step inside and head directly to the bar I suggest ordering the Whisky flight to familiarize yourself with their three very distinct spirits.  Done in the Scottish tradition their Peated will remind you of a well balanced Scotch while the Stryker will flood your senses with mesquite, oak and apple wood much like good BBQ.   Once you decide which of the three you like order your cocktail and wander around the beautiful space or sit outside and enjoy the scenery. My favorite cocktails were the Whiskey Mule and the Cherry Cola.  Holding the fifth star until I try the food which I hope will be soon."

                "description": "Yesterday, I decided to do a day trip to Spicewood today. It was first to Krause Springs then found out Iron Wolf would be open lunch time. After a refreshing morning at Krause Springs, we headed to Iron Wolf Ranch and Distillery for lunch and drinks.   They have a wide variety of spirits with several award winning ones. Tiann was great in making our drinks! I had the New Fashion made with Hotscotch (a little sweet and spicy). My husband had the Luna-tic made with vodka and several fruit juices. We enjoyed the drinks while we waited for our lunch from Craigo's. We ordered the specialty pizza (sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions) and barbecue wings. Truly phenomenal pizza and wings! We also had the Giddy Up Mary with horseradish-infused vodka and Wild and Tea, an Arnold Palmer with bourbon.   We'll have to come back another time for the tasting and meet Luna, a wolf adopted by the family (she's usually there on Fridays). Most Saturdays they have live music. Definitely check their calendar online."

Didn't do the tour or tasting. Maybe next time."

Hahaha kidding but really this place was awesome, even though it was a day with drizzle still enjoyed it! First off the staff is beyond sweet, so warm and welcoming! The drinks were great and good price! Such a fun vibe with good music. Very mellow way to spend a Sunday afternoon. So happy they had a kids area because both my 8 year old and 2 year old had a blast and stayed busy so I could enjoy a delicious Bloody Mary. They have awesome lawn games to keep busy and a delicious pizza food truck parked on site. We will for sure be back!! Do yourself a favor and pay it a visit it was a lot better than most of the distilleries I've visited."

It has one indoor bathroom and one little pizza truck -which the pizza was Okay- the kids play area is huge tires with again NO shade. Please don't even say you have a play area when the only thing they could climb on are tires that would give them second degree burns.

Very shiny stainless steel still, immaculate polished concrete floors, easily the fanciest metL building I have seen!    And they have good liquor!  The tasting is informative and interesting, even if all of the idetails on the fancy bottles is a bit overwhelming.  But the real wolf is interesting.   Try it al!!  The Giddy'Up (horseradish) vodka is better than it sounds - and it makes a fantastic Bloody Mary!  Several things were good, but you must BUY this - it is excellent!"

My boyfriend and I did the tasting - $8 for a taste of 4 spirits with 6 to choose from:  Corn Vodka - hint of sweetness and great consistency Clear Molasses Rum - not my kinda thing but this was good.  Citrus forward Gin - also not my type of spirit but I actually really liked this. Clean and fresh - perfect for Texas summers! Horseradish Vodka - you really must try the Bloody Mary with this. Yum!  Hotscotch - butterscotch pepper whiskey. We loved this so much we are bringing a bottle home.  Iron Hot - cinnamon pepper whiskey. Good if you're into cinnamon spirits.   We also had two drinks. I had the Bloody Mary with horseradish Vodka and my boyfriend had the wild tea (Arnold Palmer with bourbon). The owners have big plans for this facility and you can tell a great deal of thought and planning has been put into this establishment and spirits. I look forward to watching this place grow and develop. I'll be back next time I'm in the area!"

Nice taste. The other had the special, The Irish Wolf, it was good.  Found out there isn't a full bar, so they are making drinks out of the liquor they distill.  They are engaging, entertaining, try to sell you a tasting but don't oversell if you don't show initial interest which is nice. You can take a tour if you get the tasting.  Great areas all around the distillery to just hang out with friends and chat, or play games, chill and listen to live music or wander around the grounds a bit. Beautiful location to be out in nature. Family friendly place, folks were there with their kids and everyone seemed to be having a good time."

We originally stopped because the BBQ food truck they have on the premises is rated very high, but the liquor turned out to be the real star. Hubby partook in a liquor tasting that cost $10 for multiple samples.  They have some very unique flavors that I've never heard of anyone incorporating in a liquor before.  I ordered a bourbon and lemonade drink that hit the spot in the Texas heat.  This was a Mecca for bachelorette parties and large groups of friends.  There is plenty of room on the property to spread out and enjoy the weather.  They also host concerts on their stage next to the tasting room.  They are planning to expand their offerings here, so stay tuned as to what they build!"

Small but nice distillery has tours and tastings with a large outdoor area for hanging out and a stage for occasional music acts. I didn't play but the frisbee golf looked great.  Rum, gin, fireball, and few other mixed spirits to sample.  I personally liked and purchased the gin. Low juniper the way I like it.  Odd wild eye logo is off putting but very friendly staff."

Free samples of crafted rum too?   I'd call that a win! Owners were quite attentive as soon as we arrived. Telling us the story of the brand; walking us through each tasting.

They offer free samples of the three different whiskeys with one of them being bourbon barrel aged using Rebecca Creek barrels.   The staff was friendly and well informed on the products. Currently they are distributing to smaller local stores and will start distributing to more stores in the future.   As it is August right now we couldn't tour the distillery because it was too hot but we were informed that the tours would start in October when it cools off.   The bottles are decently priced for hand crafted rum like this.   There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, drink cocktails were decently priced, and property is a great change from the city."

The patio area in the trees was beautiful and they had this nice swing. I had the drink with the pineapple and vanilla rum.....sooooo good! It was so good my husband grabbed a bottle so we can drink it at home. If you're touring the area i would recommend coming here early and just enjoying the scenery and the lovely conversation with the guy at the bar!"

                "description": "This place is the cutest, most quaint little gem.  If there's a local distillery, I always want to try out their goods.  I didn't expect it to be at someone's home, though!  Not that it's a bad thing.  Rum, for me, is a take it or leave it type spirit.  I typically use it only in cocktails.  I don't think I've ever wanted to sit down with a glass of rum.  Now bourbon?  That's a different story.    On arrival, I just expected a tasting only, but they actually make cocktails.  They have a small menu, or you can request whatever you want from the mixers they have.  Mojito?  Of course.  Want to go dive with a great rum and just some Coke?  They won't judge you for that, either.  They make their own version of Rumchata in house and it was SO DELICIOUS.  For real.  And they'll give you the recipe.    Pick your favorite of the three varieties: Crystal, Gold, Vanilla and buy a bottle.  Then pick up a bottle of vanilla extract.  If you don't cook, make your mom very happy.  That stuff is fantastic.  In the hotter months, don't be a jerk and demand a tour of the actual distilling barn.  We all know how distilling works.  If not, the internet is your friend.  They don't want to be in the high temperatures, and neither do you.  Let them explain the process to you while you sip a nice, cool drink instead."

It was a little expensive and no tours are offered but the tastings are free which is a nice change to the other places we have been.   Make sure you try the vanilla rum and take a turn on the tree swing! My nephew loved it.   Wish they would have more signs.... the first was easy, then we were feeling lost."

I have been to other rum distilleries and have never stumbled upon such a \"harsh\" flavor that could never be drank alone. That being written we decided to have a drink on the patio...I'm glad alcohol kills germs because the guy serving us had the dirtiest hands and fingernails I have ever seen in my life and I have children. For example when he grabbed our glasses from the cabinet it left a dirty grip mark. I was pretty much grossed out. It's too bad because again the location is great."

Let's examine the facts:. -- He led us through a tour of his small but highly functional distillery. -- He answered all of our questions about the process he uses, and even showed us some of the machine parts he's made. -- His wife made us two (nicely sized) tasters: a mojito, and another thing I drank even faster than the mojito that tasted like a lemon drop.  $5 each later, we skipped right down to Wimberley Valley Spirits to get ourselves a bottle, because the law is mean and David can't sell any of the goods on the premises.  Stupid Republicans, or something.  Now we check out our unopened souvenir, plotting and planning, totally giddy that we pulled into that questionable-looking lot with the signage for rum.

The only thing I would change about our experience is that I wish we had made a reservation 24 hours in advance because you can't order charcuterie boards and wine flights without one.   Everyone is really nice, and on a chilly day, they even have blankets. I highly recommend making the trek out here!"

There is a winery and a brewery on site so everyone likely has an option they'll like = Best of both worlds. They have plenty of outdoor seating, which you could choose to sit in the sun or under the trees in the shade. We split a glass of rose and their sweet white and I would recommend either one. The sommelier was super sweet and helped us choose our wines. Would definitely recommend a stop here to relax and enjoy nature with a glass of wine in hand!"

                "description": "Completely unacceptable management. For about 2 hours a group of individuals where shouting at two tables, yelling sexually explicit language, swearing profusely, and were clearly unable to drive. At a place that prides itself in a family atmosphere, where kids are running around playing in the grass and trees, this is completely unacceptable. I am looking forward to management/ownership response to this review. In a region where wineries, breweries and distilleries are a dime a dozen, plenty of opportunities to take my business elsewhere when we come visit.  What should really concern the owners and management about what happened at Bell Springs is the fact that:  1) The Hays County sheriff was called after the incident because it was so egregious. Enough of these reviews and they will be lining up outside the parking lot for DWIs.  2) The staff (7:00 pm on 6/19) did absolutely nothing to cut off a clearly over-intoxicated group that was negatively impacting people around them  3) The staff's response (blonde and burnette hostesses), ver batim, to the vulgar language and rowdiness was \"free speech\" and \"you are the problem - I know those people\".  Fantastic - best of luck in your future endeavors . Your stellar response caused one of our group to cancel their wine membership."

It's very easy and they do allow you to amend reservations over the phone.   They produce really great wine and there's a great selection to choose from. The staff is very knowledgeable about their wines and answered all of our questions. Testing comes with a **small** array of cheeses, nuts and crackers."

We sat up on the patio with our dog and enjoyed a lovely wine tasting. We chose the solo tour which was $15 for 5 generous pours of delicious wine. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The one low point is the food truck. We got the currywurst for $10 which was good, but not a large enough serving for the price. The more upsetting part was the pretzel we got (also $10, which is very expensive). The prestel was small, hard (even though it was supposed to be a soft pretzel), and flavorless. The mustard cheese dip did its best to save it, but it wasn't enough."

                "description": "I have been here numerous times and always had an awesome experience but today was the most unacceptable experience I have ever had ANYWHERE. I was here with my family, parents, and my brothers family with a total of 5 kids (not unusual to see kids here). While here, we became aware of a group that was likely overserved and using foul/vulgar language that we tried to ignore for a long time. Once we heard the phrase \"fat c*ck\" at a ridiculous volume my husband asked them to please keep it down, which resulted in a huge altercation with various threats/insults from their end. Despite their behavior management still allowed them to stay. What's worth noting is multiple people had already complained about this group and others joined my husband in attempting them to quiet down- so they were affecting loads of people at the winery. Eventually things calmed down and the argument broke, but as we were leaving they said loudly for us to hear \"I'm so glad that douchebag is leaving\" so I gave them the finger as I was walking away (I will concede this was adding fuel to the fire but I was so fed up at this point) and they screamed to me \"FUCK YOU MOM\" across the grass. Managements response? Free speech allows them to say whatever they want. Apparently this nice hill country spot is going for the dirty 6th vibe. Save your money and go somewhere with enough pride to expel those who can't keep it together while I use my own right to free speech to notify everyone this place doesn't care about their patrons."

It was for this reason that I suggested that my kids, with their families, join my husband and me for a Father's Day celebration on Saturday evening, June 19th. When we arrived just before 5 pm, we found a good picnic spot in the shade near the bag game. We all noticed, or rather heard, a very boisterous group of 12 to 15 people sitting near the brewery. As the evening progressed, and I am assuming more alcohol was consumed, the group became louder and more profane. We attempted to ignore them, but soon it was impossible due to the volume and the increasingly prevalent and disgusting language. At that point, and because we had 5 young children with us, my son-in-law went over to the group and respectfully asked them to turn down the volume so that my Grandchildren would no longer be exposed to words like \"F*ck and C*ck\". He was immediately met with a barrage of personal slurs and threats. 2 staff members (2 young ladies, one light-haired and the other dark-haired) working that evening came over to the group, however, incredibly, the inebriated party was allowed to remain on the premises. Shortly after, every family packed up and went home, including our group.  When walking to the parking lot to leave, a particularly vile young woman yelled obscenities at my son-in-law and daughter. I turned around and went over to the group. When I arrived, I was also barraged with a variety of slurs and called a \"C*nt\". Once again, the 2 female staff members came over to the table to intercede. At this point, the dark-haired staff member shared with me that she \"knew the group\" of offenders, which helped me understand why these folks had not been asked to leave. If you happen to know staff, you can act like filthy pigs, with the knowledge that your actions will have no repercussion, regardless of the profoundly negative impact on everyone else looking to enjoy wine and food with their families.  To add insult to injury, staff had the unmitigated gall to suggest that I was the problem, not the drunk and vulgar group. When I questioned staff (dark haired young lady) why they permitted such obnoxious behavior from any patron, she suggested that hurling profanity toward others was protected under free speech. Staff continually suggested that our \"conversation was over\", indicating that they wanted me to leave. Clearly, the privilege of free speech isn't applied equally to all patrons visiting Bell Springs.  In the past 15 months, I have recommended Bell Springs to dozens of family and friends. Now, I plan to exercise my right of free speech in every forum available to tell acquaintances and strangers alike about my experience, advising that Bell Springs is not worthy of anyone's patronage."

Setup was nice with covered tables outdoors or an indoor option. I didn't check out the brewery onsite but did see some guys partaking in the brews. I would not hesitate to return."

Anne was very welcoming and friendly. She also gave us information on other wineries/breweries/distilleries to try. I had the $15 flight of reds and she also gave me an extra cup of red wine, Needy B*tch, I ended up buying a bottle! I finally found a great bottle of red that I actually enjoy, sad that I can't get it shipped to me in California. Drippin' Sweet is also great, bought a bottle as well. Love the descriptions given to the wines it made them sound all delicious. And they were! (According to all the ones I tried)."

So we are there enjoying wine glasses, wine flights, food, the atmosphere. Everything about this place is so cute and amazing. But trying to get an Uber home seemed unlikely. Everyone kept cancelling on us and the bartender Ann or Annie (plus the last two customers) kept telling us that we were not gonna walk the 2 miles home. Annie made sure that we stayed till she closed and literally DROVE US BACK TO THE AIR BNB!!!. She was the sweetest thing and didn't even want to take any money from us. We had a back and forth of take it, no keep it, take it!! Haha I'm 80% sure I got the money in her cupholder before I left but I was the tipsy one so who knows haha. I really hope I did because driving us back to our Airbnb was above and beyond."

They have wine flight options or you can enjoy a glass if you chose. The server was incredibly knowledgeable and had great recommendations for everyone in our group. She let us try what we wanted before committing to our drink of choice. I ended up going to wine cocktail called the Texas Kiri and it fresh rosemary in it which I though was a nice touch! They also have live music outside and plenty of areas to sit and enjoy listening to it. Definitely try this place out!"

As such, it wasn't a great day.  We decided to go some place else.  We showed up around 4pm on a Sunday and had the entire place to ourselves. It is so cute.  I love the decorations and the vibe. We did the wine tasting which is $7 or waved if you buy a bottle of wine.  Megan was wonderful.  She was full of information and funny.  We had such a wonderful time we decided to join Bell Springs wine club.  Three bottles a quarter. No sign up fee. They have a wine pick up party that allows you to bring your dogs.  20% discount the first year and the discount increases every year you are a member.  Free wine tasting for you and four people either at Side Car or the winery itself. You also get to pick which three bottles you want. We signed up on the spot. What is NOT to like! We enjoyed many of their wines but really it was Megan.  She made us feel so welcomed and was so friendly.  Bell Spring treat her right, she is a HUGE asset to you.  We can't wait to attend our first wine pick up party.  Hope to make it to first Thursday soon and hang out at the Side Car.  If we lived in Dripping Springs this would be a weekly stop for us.  What a great place in this sleepy town.  We are so glad to part of their wine club and excited for the many cool events moving forward.  This should be a place to stop if you are in Dripping Springs."

Jason did an excellent job of showing us around the distillery, while providing great details of the distilling process. While Still Austin knows it isn't a mega distillery, it embraces that and makes the tour and experience feel personalized. We were able to sample several different whiskeys and one gin, and we even sampled a few unreleased items, which were all very good. My wife and I would recommend this tour to everyone. Thanks Still Austin for a great experience!"

Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions. I felt like I got a lot out of the tour and now have a basic grasp of how whiskey is made.   The distillery is pretty small and they currently sell bourbon and gin as their bread and butter, both of which you'll get to sample at the end of the tour. Highly recommended to check it out as it's just a fun atmosphere."

The staff was very friendly, professional, and turned a bad situation into a very fun and amazing time. Couldn't have imagined it being any better!   The guide was very knowledgeable, the tour was insightful, and the tasting at the end was great! Go support this local Austin business!"

Got an old fashioned for 6 bucks so that was a solid deal. Didn't get any good but it looked like a bunch of fried options which my friends seemed to enjoy. It was about 60% full on a Sunday afternoon. I will say that the music was way too loud during the bingo so that made it hard to talk. Outside of bingo, the volume was fine. Overall I'd recommend it. If not, St Elmo brewing is next door."

More than that, at the end we ended at a tasting room where we sat with others on our tour and chatted.  We ended up walking down to a winery with some of those on the tour with us where we sat and chatted and then ended up going to dinner with them.  I highly recommend visiting the distillery and taking the tour!!"

I'm a tequila girl so I wasn't too eager to learn how gin and bourbon are made, but she really had my attention the entire time!   We were in a group of 10 which was just right. Everyone could get a few questions in if they wanted...laid back...chill...ITS AUSTIN!  Now, to the best part....and boy I was a bit disappointed. I've been on several tours in distilleries and the tasting at the end could get you about 2 shots away from tipsy. Typically there are about 4 samples....1.5-2 ounces each.....  Here....there were 2 samples with 1.5 ounces TOTAL!  I know all they do is gin and bourbon but can a SISTA have a bit more?! The tour is around $15pp, but I'd be happy to pay the standard $30-$40 for a tad bit more licka.    The gin and bourbon are still yummy!  Get a cocktail.....The old fashioned will have you stumbling!"

The staff was fantastic and knowledgeable and we tried some of their whiskey as well as some mixed concoctions that were fabulous.  There is a great open patio area that shares space with a food truck and the Bearded Bread Company, but the winds were blowing like crazy and the temps were too cold to be outside long. Definitely try this place!  And then explore other spots in the same Industrial Park!  The artwork on the buildings is also great to tour on its own."

They don't have tasting flights, but they do have an option to order a taste of any of their liquors for $2 each. That's not bad at all. We were able to taste the whiskey and gin. The two year whiskey was the winner. I did see some yummy cocktails that I would love to try in the near future.   They have inside and outside seating. The outside patio has a cover for shade, but you do have areas where you can get sun   There's a food truck on site.   Parking is available on site, but shared with the other businesses. For those that want to make an afternoon or day out of your visit, the other businesses are all drink or food related."

However our experience today was really disappointing and it was simply based of the service provided. I wish I got the gentleman's name because he was awesome and his drinks were well balanced. There was a female bartender who made the drinks extremely sweet and when we asked to have them remade, she was extremely rude and confrontational in her demeanor. The other male bartender took it upon himself to remake our drinks and when he tasted what she had served us, he also agreed with the taste being off. Kindness goes a long way and I wish she adopted a more graceful attitude."

                "description": "I was in Blanco camping at the state park right before Christmas. I was drinking eggnog at another distillery in the area with my wife and friends  when my buddy, John, mentioned they were stopping here on the way back to camp, as well.  When arrived, we were welcomed by a very friendly young man. We sampled all of the products on hand. I was blown away by the full-flavored taste of the gin that they only sell on the property. It is like sipping the essence of a hike through a juniper forest. I have never experienced anything like it. It is destined to be my favorite late night sipping beverage.   I left the distillery with a bottle of Ben Milam Barrel Proof Bourbon and a bottle of Provision Distiller's Gin. I've been sipping on them ever since. I will definitely be back for more!"

It is fairly new and doesn't have much business, but I don't expect that to last too long.  We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. The tasting room is small, but quaint. Their single barrel bourbon is smooth and subtle. It was our favorite whiskey of the day (we were on a self guided distillery tour). The tasting was $5 for two. Definitely also the cheapest tasting fee of the day.  If in Blanco, don't miss out in trying this whiskey out. You may just find yourself a new favorite spirit."

                "description": "Driving through Blanco last week and I've always noticed the road sign but I haven't stopped in before. Check them on Yelp and Google and couldn't find much info, so what the hell, turned around to check in out for myself.   First thing I noticed was the large shade tree, several chairs, and lush grass. I could just see me and a group of friends sitting there having a few drinks and enjoying the cooler fall temperatures because here in South Texas 91 degrees in November is just that, cool Fall. I'm having a hard time getting used to that.   Inside is a small tasting room that is put together nicely. The guy working the counter could have been a little nicer. He was busy taking in inventory and obviously working but I'd like to have heard about their process, why are they better than other distilleries in the area, what sets them apart? Who is Ben Milam, I asked and he said it was the grandfather of the owner. I know who Ben Milam was, and that is a leading figure of the Texas Revolution. I'm not a Texan but I am a history buff and there is a lot to know of Ben Milam and he's great a cool story. I purchased a flight and a bottle, roughly $56 for both. At least pretend that you care a little bit more.   The bottle I took home, it was, and I say WAS fantastic. Unfortunately, Game 7 of the Houston/Dodgers game was a little stressful and the wife and I put a huge dent in the bottle on the first night. Ha! I now have to go back and pick up another, darn. Can't wait..."

I looked at the menu and she just stood there. I ordered the flight and, again, nothing. I was the only one there and tried to make at least some small talk, but she was too busy with her cell phone to even speak. She told me NOTHING about the spirits, the distillery, nothing. She seemed put out to even be there. Finally, I bought a bottle, THEN she decided to speak. It was a horrible experience and I wish I had waited to buy the bottle at the local liquor store where it was actually cheaper. Can not recommend this place at all. The products are good, but get them at the liquor store that is right up the road."

We traveled to Blanco, TX (pop. 1700) today for Old 300 BBQ, and by chance decided to take a different way out of town than we'd come in. Right off 281 we passed by Ben Milam Whiskey, just opened since March. We had a very pleasant visit and enjoyed their whiskey flight, along with a sample of some of the best gin I've ever tasted. Everything was outstanding, but I couldn't stop thinking about their rye whiskey and had to take a bottle home with me. This is worth a trip all on it's own, even if you have to go out of your way. Nice people running the place, and fantastic whiskey."

He not only knew about the bourbon and rye, he was able to discuss whiskey from other distilleries, places to eat and other topics.   We enjoyed the bourbon and rye enough to buy both before we left. They both had nice aromas and smooth tastes. We will definitely enjoy these bottles and try to spread the word about them."

The large glass doors open up to a spacious outdoor seating area. The drink menu is fairly priced with cocktails that allow you to taste their very own whiskey, gin, and rum. If you prefer straight whiskey, they have flights/tasting samplers you can ask about.  I loved the food truck parked in their lawn (Char ATX) with delicious yakitori (Japanese meat on skewers).  They have tours of their facilities which sound really interesting. I think those tours are about $15/person (please verify with Fierce Whiskers for most up-to-date pricing).  Good-sized parking lot  This place is a hidden gem. Drive past Meanwhile and head straight to Fierce Whiskers. ;-)"

Fair warning their whiskey is new aged and won't be ready to be bottled for sale for another 2+ years. This made the tasting a littleeeee rough, but I learned a lot about whiskey so it was worth it. The tasting room is really nice and they have a great cocktail list - standard and seasonal. They host events regularly and there is a food truck on site."

He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

She was friendly and very informative.  She helped make the experience exactly what I was looking for. I wanted less sweet wines and a winery with food options. Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They are organized and timely. If you're an out of towner like myself and decide to book accommodations in Austin they will pick you up from there and bring you back.   All of my future bookings I will definitely request Wade. He was very professional and personable, he made sure we were taken care of at each location on our tour. He also was more than happy to take our pictures along the way."

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

                "description": "We recently went on a fabulous wine tour with Jodie on 4/15 and had a great time!  Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

                "description": "My mother and I had the most amazing time with Jodi. She was a perfect tour guide and took us to three great wineries. She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

I had been on another wine tour before in Wimberley, but Jodie made this tour worth it. She knew exactly where to go and even suggested certain wines at each location!   The length of the tour was the perfect amount of time as well. I would definitely recommend this tour and can't wait to go back and visit again!"

                "description": "This was my first, and sad to say, my last time doing this festival. A friend who had been a few times before highly recommended it and when I balked at the $40 (plus a $3.50 processing fee) \"pre-event discount price\" with the at the door price being $50, he assured me it was well worth it because there were so many great food and wine vendors, you get your money's worth.  This was absolutely NOT the case! Firstly, this whole thing just seemed disorganized at best and I am sorry, but for $50 ($40) they could have gotten a much nicer location than a dusty, stiflingly hot cattle stockyard!   As for what you get for $40, 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets when drinks and food run you anywhere from 1 ticket for a meager barely 1oz pour for most of the wines to several tickets for very small portions of the food, you barely get $10 worth of food and drink! You can purchase ticket for $1 a piece, which is most definitely not worth the portions or pours you receive.   As for the vendors/vintners at the festival, there were not nearly as many as you would expect for the price point and the layout was just haphazard. Also, there were several vendors that were out of food by the time we got there just after 2pm...the \"festival\" was supposed to go until 6pm...so how the heck were vendors running out of things w/4hrs left!?!   The only highlight, for me at least, was the grape stomp, but even then, they ran out of tshirts to \"stamp\" with your grape-soaked footprints.   In any case, my $43.50 would have been better spent and enjoyed at an actual local restaurant where I could have gotten multiple full pours of wine and actual food instead of leaving this joke of a festival hungry, overheated, more sober than when I arrived, and feeling like I had just been scammed somehow. Lesson. Learned.   I am honestly shocked this \"festival\" has lasted 10yrs let alone one!"

                "description": "I had a lovely time as the guest of a coworker. However, I felt like the overall value wasn't quite there for this event. Drink and food tickets went way too fast when some places asked for multiple tickets for less than an ounce of wine or a small sample of food. The actual value was about $1 per ticket. There were also some vendors that were somewhat rude or rushing. The whole point is to get business by having people try your product, right? Well there's some wineries I'd think twice about giving my money to after their lack of friendliness.   The options for food was more limited than I expected and many ran out of food even though we got there just an hour after the event started. There are lots of raffles going on and free koozies and pens galore. The arena was stuffy inside and though fresh near the doors you ran the risk of also eating dirt.   The music was good but there needed to be more sitting areas to relax and open a bottle of wine. I will definitely go back next year, but I do hope to see more offerings."

                "description": "This was by far the most awful \"festival\" I have ever had the misfortune of wasting money on.   First of all, in 2012 it was held at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company. So all advertisements this year were of a gorgeous event at this lovely vineyard - The photos were of a classy event, surrounded by olive trees and rolling hills, adorable art booths scattered about the lovely property, smiling faces holding wine glasses. I was so excited based on what I was reading of the Olive Company event that I had my mother travel up 3 hours on the morning of Saturday the 14th to accompany me. Then I convinced another girlfriend of mine to join. We had our tickets in advance, $40.00 online purchase, and my girlfriend paid at the door - $50.00.   Now, regardless of where the ACTUAL event for 2013 was advertised as being held - between the advertisements on Yelp, on Facebook and scattered about Dripping Springs, it was VERY unclear to anyone coming from outside of town where the hell this event actually was.   So we arrived at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company to find no tents, no events, no nothing but a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful land. Inside there were very few customers. But we were greeted warmly, given amazing samples (DO go there and DO try their olive oils and balsamic vinegars and DO check out their $55.00 romantic date night packages).   Making the best of what was already frustrating, we had a few samples and they sent us on to the Dripping Springs Park Ranch - or something like that, up Ranch Road Twelve.   We were still optimistic until we saw the HUGE metal pavilion looming ahead, situated in the midst of probably two square miles of plowed up red dirt which will eventually be a parking lot. As we navigated in, driving through dirt among hundreds of cars, we noticed piles of dirt, bull dozers, caution tape... this entire venue was a.) an agricultural fair pavilion and b.) UTTERLY UNFINISHED.   I was mortified. I brought guests, I paid money, and we were supposed to be in the midst of lush, rolling hill country sipping wine and sampling cheese. Not walking through 300 yards of dirt to get to an unfinished metal building. This was already so embarrassing and already not worth the money.   We had to enter at the back of this enormous, godawful construction, walk through the art vendors, then across MORE dirt on the rodeo floor (where the paying guests tables were and the music) where we were given six drink tickets and ten food tickets. When we reached the one interior part of the building, we were encountered by swarms of casually dressed, generally rude, pushy guests who were buzzing around a square room with no proper traffic flow. There we found out that each drink ticket gave us ONE OUNCE of wine, which was poured by rude and distracted vendors. We also found that each food ticket did not entitle us to a sample - samples cost anywhere from 2 to 5 tickets. One ticket got you the likes of ONE chip with a dollop of something on it.   I was blocked and almost run over by a RUDE and completely OBLIVIOUS staff member who was blocking the only entrance to the tasting room. Other guests were hogging the only FIVE standing tables in the are, they'd put their purses up there and stand around and send other guests to get them samples, so there was no where to set down your things and you had to juggle a glass of wine, your tickets, your purse, and a plate of food and in order to eat it, back through the ONE door you went, down the stairs to the dirt on the rodeo arena floor.   We left without even using the tickets we had - not worth the paltry return for what we'd spent and what we had to endure to get there.   I will never return to this event. I want my money back from this event. The Dripping Springs Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed of the overall mess and disappointment this fiasco was - they don't deserve a dime of the money they raised from it.   TERRIBLE."

I enjoyed the wide variety of beer, wine, and liquor to choose from, but I wish there were a few more food options. What made it worth the price of admission was the sommelier talk at 3:30 where there was no-ticket-required wine comparison tasting, and I learned a few things. Take advantage of those demos if you go next year. Also there were a few food stands with free samples no tickets required (pecans were a favorite, olive oil, chips and salsa, etc). I wish I had hit the liquor area sooner, they seemed to have generous pours. I may hit this event again next year, or I may not, but I definitely had a good time."

For that money you receive a twin Iiquors reusable bag, some goodies inside the bag including a wine glass, 10 food tickets and 6 wine tickets.  Each wine ticket was good for a 1oz pour.  And the food tickets could be used at more than 10 food vendors for various amounts.  It is called Dripping with Taste because it is supposed to be a \"taste\" not a full glass or full meal.  I will tell you that I had plenty of food for my 10 tickets!  And got to try 6 different wines!    I will say that a previous post about volunteers having to work 2 hours and then getting unlimited food and drinks is absolutely false.  Volunteers had to work a minimum of 3 hour shifts but most worked many, many more hours not only the day of the event but also prior to the event and they got the same 10 food tickets and 6 alcohol tickets.  I learned a lot about local wineries, breweries, and distilleries and tasted some awesome food from some local restaurants that I had not yet eaten at."

So you pay $40 for a single glass of wine. HEB gave away 2 chips with salsa for 1 ticket, empanadas were 5 tickets. I was denied BUYING a bottle of water, so that the volunteers could have them.   This brings me to the point, if you want to go to dripping with taste, volunteer. They treat the volunteers far better than paying guests. They do their jobs for 2 hours then get to enjoy UNLIMITED drinks and food and get cool shirts that aren't available to buy to us regulars.   I was very unimpressed Dripping Springs."

A couple sample size appetizers and a few gargle-worth 's wine samples! Furthermore, it was inside and stifling!! I'd much rather pay a little more and get unlimited tastings, at least I'd feel like I got my money's worth. Sorry Dripping, won't be back. Huge disappointment."

Everyone parking had no idea where to go. Other than that, the new Ranch/event center is nice. There were lots of vendors and lots to choose from.

It was raining when we arrived, I know that no one can help that, but we were one of the first to arrive and we directed to park at the back end of a mud field. Instead of filling up the lot nearest the event, we had to walk though a water logged muddy field.   Then the signing up volunteers, one of the online register volunteers, was the rudest person I have met in a long time. She reminded me of one of the Orks from Lord of the Rings.   So you get 10 food tickets and 6 drink tickets. What you fail to learn until you have paid ($50) is that 10 food tickets doesn't mean 10 small samples, all of the samples were multiple tickets. Essentially, your $50 gets you two tacos and the six drink tickets equal about one glass of wine.   A truly crap festival."

I have attended literally dozens of wine festivals, mostly in California. Believe me that the Dripping with Taste Festival is, by far, the best value on the market. Spending $40 for the initial tickets is next to nothing compared to the analogous events in California. AND purchasing additional tickets for a buck each is very cheap compared to other such events.   I have attended the last two Dripping with Taste festivals and plan to continue to attend every year. I look forward to this event based on the quality of the event and the very, very low cost. Both years I have come away with the feeling that I got more than my money's worth and found several Texas wines to add to my wine cellar!"

I live in Drippings and saw this massive structure being erected.  Its quite the eye sore.  That'd be fine if it wasn't so expensive.  Worse, it is actually held in a tiny closed off indoor part of the complex that's maybe a 1/8th the size of the whole place.  Needless to say, it was over crowded, people packed in like sardines.  My family wanted to leave rather quickly because it just flat out sucked.  Some the vendors were generous some were stingy and acted like it was a chore to deal with you.  Stay away from this event."

I decided to try it again this year since it sounded like a great venue but I was very disappointed here as well. The place was nice and large but very hot and had a messy, red dirt floor. Really, I spent $40 on a cattle pen?  The wineries were nice but there were not enough food vendors and most were over-priced. My legs and feet were disgustingly dirty by the time we left. It also made me wonder how much of that dirt ended up on the food.  That's two out of two disappointments with that event and I will not be going back until a better location is used. If it happens a third time, well it will be third time and your out. There are plenty of nicer wine events around Texas that don't charge that much for entry and are much more fun."

We sampled food from most of the vendors, the quality was outstanding and we found everyone to be warm, friendly and knowledgable. As always, great wines, loved the beer garden, and glad to see the addition of spirits. The music added a nice ambience. We enjoyed our beer, wine and food sitting comfortably watching the shows.

                "description": "Love this place. They have live music too so check their calendar! Great relaxing vibe.  Great drinks, great staff, and tons of games to play with friends:) just wish they had paper straws. We loved Ashley the bartender on staff. Super friendly and made sure we loved our drink choices (all the drinks here are great).  Special note: They also rescued a baby cow named Moonshine who is like a little puppy- she loves some pets and will lick your hands a few chickens running around too.   Drink suggestions: great bloody Mary's! I also really like their passion fruit vodka!  Food: mmmk they have the best Mac and cheese! This is a must here. It's super smokey I loved it. They have lots of meat options too.  They have fans blowing water/misting you in the heat and twinkle lights everywhere.  Kid friendly? Yup, although I didn't see any when I went they gave a big play structure behind the car!  Parking on site"

                "description": "This place is an absolute knockout.   We went as a thing to do while staying nearby, and wow! We will go back just to hang out some more.   We got there for lunch time and to try a cocktail and eat BBQ as it's really near the local RV park. The vodka is delicious. They offer samples and have a broad selection of flavor profiles. We tried a good number of cocktails each of which was fantastic and flavorful. Jackie the bartender was wonderful to talk to and kept my wife ms drink full, my kids happy with mock tails and unsold me on a bottle of vodka, and a cinnamon vodka ( I hate cinnamon). Catfish, the master distiller came by the bar and had some awesome stories and insights into how Planet Rock became a thing.   If that's not enough to get you there for a taste, the BBQ truck does great food. Get the Texas Twinkie. The ribs were great as was the quesadilla and the stuffed potato but trust me, get yourself a Twinkie.   If you are anywhere nearby try this place. It's pet, child, and adult friendly. And they have live music. How can you go wrong?"

Catfish is distilling some of the best vodka anywhere, and his staff are mixing up cocktails that rival the trendiest places downtown. And this is all in a laid-back, dog-friendly, wear your comfy jeans, no pretension atmosphere. It's like hanging out in someone's backyard... if that someone had great live music, acrobats, and world class spirits.  And while all the drinks are amazing (you seriously can't go wrong), the Bloody Mary selections are out of this world."

We are visitors to Austin and Planet Rock was recommended by a local family last night at dinner, so wanting to experience local places rather than tourist spots, we decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint! I have to say that we enjoyed the BEST Bloody Mary we've ever had! Planet Rock's vodka is so smooth and with the added Bloody Mary mix combination and a piece of brisket, heaven! Service was excellent and the live music by Sharon Bourbonnais was very enjoyable also. I'm thinking we'll be back before heading home!"

The demon vodka is a terrible mistress that can weaken your soul, lead you astray and give you many hangovers. The prices of vice, in its many forms.  But I ask, are we to avoid the rich experience of human vice, or is this pursuing human vice that gives us meaning?  Good vodka enables the philosopher that resides in each of us.  Many adventures await us as the consequences of our choices.  Vodka is a choice. Choose wisely."

Here's my checklist for your afternoon- 1. Have a killer drink. 2. Have some killer bbq. 3. Say hi to Catfish, the master distiller. He's the one with the magnificent beard and the hearty laugh likely by the bar. 4. Pet a chicken (there are a few running around)  5. Say what's up to Moonshine, their mini zebu cow that thinks he's a dog.  Can be seen chasing squirrels or prancing around the grounds.

                "description": "GF and I both came in at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon via a prior RSVP to meet Ron Yates himself and do a full tasting experience with him as our server. This experience was amazing!  The indoor tasting room is large and open, welcoming and chill. Adorned with many award-winning wines of theirs that number beyond what I could count.   We got front-of-house seats together and begin our tasting journey through several whites and reds and sparkling wines. After what had to be 10-12 wines, we honed our picks down to the 'cabernet claret' for my GF and the 'tandem' red for me. However, not one of the wines we tried did we both truly feel we hated or disliked. Normally 1-2 are an easy pass but frankly, every wine we had was very good. My GF prefers sweeter wines across the board so the fact that nearly every wine she had still pleased her was saying something.  Ron was a top-notch host and server for us. His passion and love for wine is all but very clear in his conviction to his craft, knowledge of wine science and methodology, history of the business origins, name creations and labels to the wine bottles... all of it is an adventure with him as the animated storyteller of his wines and how the grapy goodness in the bottle got there and what you can expect to experience when it hits your lips.  I have to mention that they host an annual chili cook-off event every last Saturday of Feb with live music, 15+ chili contenders, and wine tasting all day long. It's their most successful event to date each year. When he spoke of that I made plans to be there for that for sure!  Ron and the team have a solid handle on this wine thing that is for darn sure! We only barely looked over the vineyard grounds so next time we come back, its gonna be charcuterie board, wine and time out in the vines for sure!"

I purchased the Christmas Wine Passport to help me with this in December, and Spicewood was one of the vineyards I passed through. The experience was good. The facilities were beautiful, and it was a peaceful place to chill and relax. I got there shortly after opening, and there was only one other couple there, so I was able to get my tastings quickly and easily. The wines were good, especially their dry sparkling, but I was not moved to come home with anything. The selection I was offered was more heavy on bolder reds, and as a matter of preference I would rather have a good mixutre of reds and whites. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a place I'd cross off my list. Their tempranillos were quite tasty, and I did like their dry sparkling wine."

Beautiful outdoor patio seating or you can sit inside. They have 2 tasting menus to choose from for $15 each. Hubby went for the bold reds. They don't have all white tasting but our amazing server let me taste all the sparkling wines which was so fun! The sparkling Chardonnay was my favorite. Hubby's favorite was independence and tandem.  They have charcuterie boards ($25)  or you can bring your own food. We got the charcuterie board and had a great selection of cheese."

Spicewood's offerings opened a whole new chapter in our wine lifestyle upon completing that first visit.  When we first entered their tasting room, we noticed a plethora of wine award medallions on display. Being a volunteer on the Houston Rodeo, I was especially pleased to see many Rodeo Houston awards. But that wasn't all - Spicewood has awards from wine contests all around the country! Hmmmmm...  As we proceeded through our tasting, we were immediately impressed. Texas wine? This good? Yes, indeed! So good, in fact, that I joined their wine club without hesitation and remain a member to this day.   We visited again yesterday and enjoyed complimentary tastings of six nice wines and picked up our wine club orders from the past couple of quarters. We sat on their patio overlooking the vineyard and remarked how we are so happy to have found this spot. Oh, and the people working here are gracious and genuinely friendly.  Spicewood is a tad off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trek."

Of course things were a little different with Covid going on but everything was spaced out and carefully planned out for everyone's safety. When we arrived Ron was in the porch helping the guests with their wine selections. He is always very nice and makes everyone feel at home. It's always nice when the owner with everything he has to do remembers your names. After our picnic we got to sit in the Wine Cellar which was awesome. Highly recommend visiting, enjoying the scenery and trying out all the great tasting wines.   Hats off to Ron and Crew!   Adrian and Cyndi"

We felt...tolerated...at best. We were met by 3 huge dogs who barked incessantly upon our arrival and throughout the visit. When the host finally came out he didn't offer up options for the tastings like we've experienced at other wineries. I'm pretty clear on what I like and had some ideas of wines I'd like to try with the intent of buying enough bottles to make a case of assorted bottles upon departing. The owner, who has great reviews on Yelp, either wasn't there or was busy. We didn't see this person. But we pushed through the tasting, cut it a bit short, and left much, much sooner than we'd ever imagined we would. My intuition upon arrival was to just leave. We should have done that.  This is our experience. And it just wasn't pleasant. We were the only guests yet felt we were in the way.  Hopefully, for others, their visits will be more aligned with this place's other more positive reviews."

Since they seemed to blend grapes from outside of Texas with estate, gives their wines a different character than most I've tasted from Calif and Washington for the same grape varietal.    For non-wine items to consider, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, dog friendly, indoor and outdoor seating with a nice babbling brook adjacent.   They do have an event facility and would make a nice venue for any type of occasion.  They have a hearty cheese plate that won't disappoint.  I would not use the spicy cheese however."

                "description": "I was pleasantly surprised by Spicewood Vineyards.  Spicewood was originally founded by the Manigolds.  Their vision was to make wine only from estate grown grapes. They were smart when they planted their vineyard.  They analyzed the soil and only planted grape varieties that would thrive in their soil.  Nine of the original 17 acres planted by the Manigolds are still producing fruit. For Texas that means something. That means wine sourced from grapes growing on vines that are now 24 plus years old.  Ron Yates took over from the Manigolds and is now the owner of Spicewood, and with wine maker Todd Crowell is making some good Texas sourced wines.  They now have thirty two acres planted on site, and partner with other Texas grape growers.    I like that the tasting room is a bit off the common path. That means it is away from the hustle and bustle of other Hill Country wineries.  The tasting room is spacious.  It has a homey lodge like feeling that is very inviting. They also have a beautiful tree shaded outdoor space.    The staff here are like family. They are knowledgeable and friendly.  I tasted through a selection of their vast options available. I found them to be well balanced.  Surprisingly I liked their Sauvignon blanc along with other of their wines."

                "description": "My experience was a 4-5 like many of those you will see here. However, our lovely day was ruined when one of the resident dogs or a customer's dog charged us aggressively while I was walking with my 10 month old baby in my arms. I cannot be sure if it was a resident dog or a guest's dog, but it was one of the gray colored Blue Lacey's).  Regardless, the dog was unprovoked by us. I had to hand my baby to my wife while I tried to protect them from this aggressive dog, hair bristled up and darting in at me aggressively as if to bite. Luckily it didn't bite us. The dogs owner chastised me for reacting strongly in defense of my wife and baby, which really frustrated me. We immediately left and I will not be returning. I wanted to post this in case a child is attacked by a dog on their premises in the future. It is documented and the owners have been informed that their aggressive dog or lack of leash laws are creating a liability and awful experience."

                "description": "I'm badly remiss in not posting a positive review for almost a year; what's more this is one of my personal favorite wineries in Texas Hill Country.  It's time I corrected this.   Spicewood has one of my personal favorite tasting rooms; while on the inside it's nothing special, the outside grounds and seating mimic an upscale, modern country house that I could see myself living in (*cough cough* once I win the lottery *cough cough*).  There's also a cool little stream they have running through the place so you can hear the sound of running or falling water when you sit to have a sip.  Nice touch.  Spicewood's won a bunch of awards for various wines but the two standouts IMO are their 2013 Syrah and their Riesling, which has a fruity taste and a magnificent green-apple crisp bouquet.  Note: As of May 2016, their site does not show the Riesling for sale, so I'd call ahead if you want to taste it.  As an added bonus, it's only 10 minutes away from It's All Good and Opie's, both of whom have some of my favorite BBQ outside the Austin area."

I filled out an inquiry form and then was contacted right away. We booked a private tour for a couples trip. Alee was great in providing suggestions and making sure to fit what we wanted as part of the tour. We got to tour Hawk's Shadow, then had a tasting at Duchman and ended our tour with some delicious BBQ from Salt Lick, next to Salt Lick Cellars. Tom, our driver was so nice and flexible with our schedule. He reminded us of how much time we had but did not feel rushed at all. We'll definitely be booking Slowpokes for any future trips!"

We were able to choose our wineries and she even picked us up and dropped us off at our BNB. She had the most amazing tapas tray, with cheese, mixed nuts, her special dip, crackers, breads and meats. She had this prepared and sat out for us at Wimberly winery,  halfway through the tour. At the end of this stop, she even had cupcakes for my moms birthday. I had actually called around different wine tours in the area and Slow Poke Wine tours offered the best value and I can tell you now, the best service. We wouldn't hesitate to do it again. This trip with my mom was priceless and so special. I thank you Linda for making an amazing memory for my mom and I."

My now fiancée and I rode in the Model T Ford, which was all-original except for the brakes. I contacted Linda with any questions, concerns, and booking, and Linda picked up my fiancée in a Mercedes van.  We went to a great breakfast, and then David drove us around in the Model T Ford. The route was scenic, breathe taking, and beautiful.  The wineries we stopped at were great, and, the customer service from Linda and David was unbeatable.  They have a unique business that is more than just a van or limo driving you around to distilleries, breweries, or wineries (although they also have a Mercedes van option).  I am now going on another tour with them for a bachelor party, and they could not have provided more prompt replies to my requests for information related to travel, pick up at different locations, types of tours they offer, and pricing.  What a great business run by some truly nice and professional people who offer very reasonable pricing.  I plan to use their services again in the future."

I did not have a lot of information on the distilleries and Daniel was incredibly helpful when figuring out where we should go. We had 19 people on the bus and we had SO much fun. The bus was super clean, Daniel was great and we had the best time. We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

The atmosphere is lively with board games and great decor inside, and a food truck and lots of picnic tables outside for large groups.   However, my group ordered 2 different red wines and 1 sparkling white wine and felt that the wines were lacking in flavor and very watery. Maybe this is how Austin wine is, but if you're looking for deeper, richer flavored wine, I would go somewhere else."

The menu selection for cheese variations are subpar. We did try some octopus and squid, which was an interesting discussion over some glasses of wine. You can only imagine how these convos went lol! All in all, I highly recommend stopping in for an interesting glass or two. Cheers to more wine!"

I was not going to get any snacks, but their cheese and charcuterie board was calling my name.  We both got the tasting. Each of us got different wines. Our favs were the Tempranillo, Grenache and spaghetti western. You can get all your wines at once or one at a time. I suggest getting them all at once because staff can get busy.  The cheese and charcuterie board paired well with our wines and it was definitely the perfect snack. Loved the cheese selection. The bread sprinkled with olive oil made my day cause who doesn't love bread They have inside and outside seating available. Parking is onsite, but shared with other businesses."

The first time we came here, they had a private event going on so that was sad. The second time, we got here a few hours early so they hadn't opened - that's our fault. Finally, our third attempt was fruitful!  The service here is super chill and on top of things. We 2 flights so we got to taste a good variety of samples. Great pours. We ended up leaving w one of their best bottles and now we're saving it for a special occasion.   We got (ranked from 'pour me another' to meh): *Violet Crown *Tempranillo Nuevo *Vermentino *Red-Nat *Picpoul *Piquette - this seems to be a star here but we personally hated it - tasted a bit like dilute pickle juice  A bottle we had before coming to this place was their Hill Country Rosso and that's still my favorite.  As far as COVID safety goes, the tables are super spread out, the staff wears masks at all times, and everything seems clean.   This place is super cool and what seems to be a hidden gem."

The Yard is the location and they have several business including this winery, a distillery, a brewery, and a few other places. The wine was good and the cheese and charcuterie board was a good size. I'd like to give 5 stars, but we had to ask for napkins, no plates given either. It was also a bit messy inside. Not sure if they were re-organizing or what.

During the 'rona, it is recommended to ensure you can get a spot.   My hubby and I did a wine flight a piece. We tried all the reds, the rose, and white wine (Vermentino). We ended up buying a bottle of Malbec to take home which we both had enjoyed. Note, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   I really like the atmosphere of the winery as it is inside a warehouse where they make their own wine and buy their grapes. The winery has a few things to eat or you can buy pizza from Lil Nonna's. The pizza takes awhile but you can always purchase online and set a date. If you are done at the winery you can also bar hope in the area for beer, cocktails, and whiskey."

                "description": "Star service and a non-judgmental space. I dig you, Austin Winery!  We decided on Austin Winery after we had plans to go to Spokesman next door for some beers. Unfortunately, Spokesman had an event going on that looked a little noisy and full for our study date, hence the change in venues. The winery was very spacious and lofty--I love that in an industrial winery! We asked if we could move a table (to plug in to their only one outlet--score!) and do some computer work with their wifi. The gal at the tasting room was fantastically wonderful. She gave us a large smile and told us to do whatever we wanted. Wonderful service alone will get me to come back. That's for sure.  We each got a flight of wine to try, and got down to it until they closed. They have a good selection of whites, rose's and reds, so fret not friends. All is provided. They also have some light bites like cheeses and charcuteries, so you can definitely go with that if you're hungry. The tastings were a little pricey compared to what you might get at a wine tasting out in the vineyards (I used to work in the industry), but you're paying for the convenience of being in South Austin and lots of space to hold conversations, play board games and just be with your groups. They have loads of seating and an upstairs area (that a Bachelorette party was using). Restrooms are clean and wifi is strong. We also walked home with some Brose (a hilarious take on rose especially because it was a women-lead winery effort). Clean, classy and airy space."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

Planning to visit four wineries on a Sunday afternoon, I hired Vintage Car Service so we wouldn't have to worry about becoming safety hazards on the road. Prior to our visit, Josh offered advice on where to go. Lezli picked us up at our BandB right on schedule. We were impressed with her knowledge of the area and its wineries. She helped us rearrange our schedule a bit when our visit at one winery went longer than planned (that's on me - I tried to cram too much into an afternoon).  THIS is the way to do a wine tour. We will be regular customers when we return to Fredericksburg!"

I'm so glad I did.   1) personalized service. Josh took us to 4 wineries personalized to our tastes. Your tour is likely going to be nothing like ours. If you want a distillery tour they can do that too.   2) new, clean vehicle.  My mom has mobility issues. Getting in and out of a shuttle isn't the easiest. We could relax in this SUV and she had no issues getting out of it.   3) private service. Josh was our photographer, tour guide and even purse holder for the day. He knows a lot about wine! At the end of our tour he brought in all of our wine! We could do things at our own puce.   4) the price was comparable to other services. The price does not include tastings but that is ok. Sometimes you just want a glass or two.   Overall, I would highly recommend this service!"

They worked with me on the wineries and Distillery the group chose to ensure that the time worked within our tour, so everyone could enjoy the tasting and lunch without feeling rushed. Austin Wine Tours also provided us with a great driver. I have to say our driver Charlie was awesome, he called before arriving, he was prompt and ensured we had everything before leaving the pickup spot. Charlie made our tour very comfortable, the ride to and from the wineries and Distillery was amazing. Charlie ensured that we were taken care of.  We will definitely be booking another tour with you folks and requesting Charlie.   Thank you again,  Laurie"

                "description": "10/10 would recommend Austin Wine Tours! First off, booking and choosing our agenda was super easy and they even let me adjust the headcount when that changed. On the day of, I got a heads-up call to confirm the time and pickup location. We had a larger, rowdy group of gals on a bachelorette trip and our driver Song took SUCH good care of us! She immediately asked us what music we wanted to crank and encouraged all the \"wooing\" from the back of the van. She also offered to take pictures of us, scouted out the best locations for group photos and even took TONS of candid pics of us while we enjoyed the winery and distillery we went to. She helped with all of the logistics of checking in at each stop and making sure we were taken care of. She also let us make a pee stop on the way home...and overall she was just SUPER nice and was basically hyping us up the entire day, making sure the bride felt special and making sure we all had fun. By the end of the day we all felt like she was part of the crew. Thank you again Song!!"

The wineries were beautiful and we were able to schedule a stop at the salt lick for our private tour. Kyle was the best tour guide ever!! He was very personable, took numerous pictures for us at each winery and made sure we were having fun! I would def. recommend if you are looking at different companies to pick Austin Wine Tours (ZWay Tours) since I called 5 others and they were the most accommodating with what we wanted for a private tour and their price beat most of the other ones too!  Would def. book them again and request Kyle!"

                "description": "The review that I left in regards to the services booked through Austin Wine Tours was in no way false. I will stand firm by what was written.   I even received a call back in May while on a business trip from the shuttle service company asking if we would pay the overtime for Hugo because AWT had not paid them yet. We even tipped Hugo an additional amount for his extra time spent with us.   The response just posted (almost 4 months later) is also extremely unprofessional and misleading. We were promised a great time for a bachelorette party and were let down. Plain and simple. Those employed by AWT that we spoke with were rude as well. Secondly, I never said that AWT hosted prom events/transportation. I was told that the company that is usually utilized was completely full (by Brad) and that prom happened to be a priority and the school bus that was sent was all they could get us even though we were promised a party bus.   At the end of the day we were completely dissatisfied with the services offered by AWT. Calling a client a bridezilla (who in fact actually never spoke to any AWT employee), claiming your company has gotten PTSD from our group and falsely accusing our group to be racist by saying we told \"blackie to leave\" is unprofessional and disrespectful amongst other things said in response to our reviews. All of those involved would be happy to discuss this event again in a professional manner since you mentioned that we were offered a full refund when that in fact was not true. We were offered maybe $350 (I could be wrong on this amount since we haven't heard/spoken to anyone from AWT for several months) in return if we removed our reviews.  As a company you should take responsibility instead of blaming others for your mistakes that way you can fix the problem and do better for future patrons. Especially since there has been no money refunded at this point."

I initially booked online and didn't know what venues to go to at first but they recommended the ones that we ended up going to even though it was completely up to us where we wanted to go which I liked. We decided after to tastings to go eat at Salt Lick BBQ and the food was amazing and hit the spot in between tastings. After that we went to our final tasting at Fall Creek which was right across the street and the service there was great. It made our bachelorette party very fun and we didn't have to worry about anything other than having a good time which I liked."

                "description": "Booking our wine excursion was stress free the moment Sara answered the phone! Sara was very informative and laid everything out, giving us a doable timeline for the afternoon we wanted. The itinerary we received gave us a good idea of how long to spend at each venue. There were only 4 people in our group, so we were able to do a very flexible hourly option, with appointments at the wineries.  Since we had less than 5 passengers, our tastings weren't included (informed that going in) however, that did not deter our experience... it was awesome! Buying a bottle of wine at each venue was very affordable when we split the cost among us.  George, our driver, was professional and friendly; and the limo experience was awesome! You might want to bring snacks just in case someone gets a bit tipsy, but most wineries offer food of some kind. Thanks Austin Wine Tours, for making me look like a champ with my high maintenance friends... I'll be back!"

The points of interest were superb and the last stop we made provided one of the best meals I've had in my life and most likely the best ribeye ever.

                "description": "First I would like to start with the facts.  1. We booked this tour months ago but unfortunately had to reschedule to a later date. (due to Covid19) This was not an issue for anyone attending the tour and the company got all $2800 paid for in full. 2. Yes $2800. We had 28 people in our group, It required two buses that were at their max capacity.  3. I would give a HUGE ZERO if I could.   The buses arrived at the pick up location 25 minutes early and expected us (all 28) to load up. Not all 28 people were even there yet. The male driver already seemed annoyed at this point.  We ended up pulling out at the agreed on time. When trying to leave the 2nd winery we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  But that unfortunately is not why I am writing this review   As we were loading the bus to go home the male driver said that would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilt something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe but she agreed to pay it she sat down. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from Him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off and the other bus also unloaded.  Now it is important to note the other driver said we didn't do anything wrong and that she didn't agree with how he was handling things. He told her he was in charge and that he would make the call. She became quiet after that. They ultimately left us there to find our own rides.  The male driver was rude and didn't speak unless spoken to the entire day. A beautiful day with amazing company was RUINED by this company and I will not recommend them to anyone!"

When I called to add the 2 he told me he would have to see if that was even possible. I didn't understand why after he assured me it would be fine and a sprinter van hold more than that. He had given the sprinter van to a larger crowd and downgraded us to an SUV without asking me (same price). I asked him when I would hear back and he said whenever he located another vehicle. I made some calls and found a better business who really wanted to host me and our guests. I called again to cancel with Dale and was told I am not the type of customer he would want. I guess a customer who wants to pay more money to add more people isn't good... very strange. Talking to a woman like that is not ok. I hope that he was having a bad few days and that he doesn't always behave like this, but I was really shocked how rude and unprofessional he was. Pros: I got my money back."

                "description": "One of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a \"wine tour\" company. I have been on many wine tours in my days, across different parts of Texas, and their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and just blatant disrespect was appalling.   This \"wine tour\" had a total of two buses and a party consisting of 28 people. A group of people that I have known for years that have the utmost of respect and common courtesy for any company that they hire or work with.   From the start of our experience, both drivers were incredibly rude and unfriendly. The bus lacked any amenities one would think this \"Premier Hill Country Wine Tasting Experience\" would consist of.  The first winery.  * We arrived at the first winery at 10:48am to learn that the winery doesn't even open until 11:00am and that they WEREN'T expecting us at all... * Not the wineries fault. They were fantastic.  The second winery.  * Again, wasn't expecting us, causing us to have to sit at a tent down a road from the winery. Again, not the wineries fault, they handled it incredibly.  * When trying to leave the second winery, we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  The third winery.  * As we were loading the bus to go home, the male driver said that they would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilled something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe, but she agreed to pay it. (*To clarify, open containers were allowed as stated on their website: \"Consumption of alcohol on the bus is allowed unless there are minors present.\") Minor spills like this are inevitable when providing a service as they do. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off, and the other bus also unloaded.  I know these times are hard, especially for small and locally owned businesses, and by no means and am I trying to make it harder for them; in fact, I am going above and beyond to support them. After yesterday, I do think that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their actions and really think long and hard about what they do and why they do it. In the end, when providing a service, the client always comes first."

To be honest, the cost seemed a bit high at first but having never been on a wine tour before and I really had no idea. Afterward I realize it was worth every bit of it. Dale picked us up at our BnB along with everyone else on the tour that day and we were off to the first tasting.  He seem to know everyone along the tour and at each place they were very welcoming and grateful to have our group. It really was a fun time and we had the chance to try many different wines that we would not have normally picked.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in checking out some Texas wines, for a nice weekend getaway, or just to try something different.  It definitely helped that we had a good group of people who were also on the tour that day as well. It was a blast...I just wish we had taken more pictures."

First off, Dale is a pretentious, \"underpaid monkey\" as he likes to be called. He is rude, unprofessional, and has the audacity to 'hate mail' potential clients and I know I'm not the first one because I've seen the reviews! I don't have much else to say but be careful and do your research before spending any money on this place! The owner seems to not have a care in the world if it's not benefitting him. Also, be ready for rude phone calls and emails from Dale if he doesn't get his way. He was hard to get ahold of from the jump, not to mention I live out of town and couldn't wait for days in between responses. After not being able to make it to my appointment because he had failed to get back to me promptly, I proceeded on with my day. The next morning I wake up to the most rude, despicable email I've ever received. Just be careful and read reviews because from what I've read, if you want a beautiful wedding with NICE, FRIENDLY people, this isn't the place. I'll attach one of many emails. STAY AWAY FROM THE HEART OF TEXAS RANCH ALL TOGETHER!!!"

                "description": "Amazing time with a group of 7 of us girls. Our guide was Christy and she was outgoing and made us all feel like nothing was a bother for her. Picked us up at our hotel in Fredericksburg, went to pick up lunch, and then on to first of 4 wineries. She took care of everything. Even loaded up our bottles/goodies in the back of the bus and kept the AC on to keep it all cool.  Christy went above and beyond to keep everything organized, she set up our lunch, picked up our trash, offered to take us anywhere we wanted to go, and she kept us on time to all of our tastings. We bought a bottle of wine at the 3rd winery and drank in the bus on the way to the 4th. Lunch was a boxed lunch bought at local deli (very good). Everything was included. Everything was professional. The bus was large and comfy. Highly recommend this tour company!"

He was also very accommodating as the number of girls going on the tour changed at the last minute. We went to Fat Ass, Six Shooter and Fiesta Vineyards which were a blast and everyone enjoyed the tastings. Our driver Rick was funny and a true gentleman. It was raining that day and he had an umbrella to escort everyone in and out of the tasting rooms so no one got soaked. One of the girls left their phone on the tour bus and Rick came back later that evening to return the phone even after we offered to meet him half way. We had a great time and would recommend this tour to anyone!"

                "description": "We paid nearly four hundred dollars and it was a joke. What was supposed to be a winery tour was a tour of places that sold wine. We went to a store in downtown marble falls, an art studio, a grocery store and at the very end an actual winery. This constituted our day.   This is NOT a day of going to wineries in the hill country. Everyone was disappointed on Valentine's day.   The guy who led the tour was nice but they clearly got kickbacks where we went.   When we went to lunch no one got their order and right when we were leaving this sandwich shop the tour guide asked, \"everyone went to the tasting room, right?\" We're talking about a sandwich place being a stop on the wine tour people.   Horribly disappointed. Considering tastings were at most $10 for each of the four \"wineries\" we went to, it was a rip off in value.  The company clearly avoided going to respectable wineries and instead went to dead end places where they could maximize their profit margin.   Avoid at all costs!!"

I loved that they were villas so you're not sharing common space with anyone else during Covid.  The spa not being open was a big bummer. It was partially the reason we chose here so that was disappointing.  The staff was nice, they were super welcoming.  There is no daily cleaning or maid service due to Covid.  Nice location being a short 20 minutes or so to Fredericksburg.  There are numerous wineries between here and there to keep you entertained! I like that they had on site live music (one night instead of the two advertised though) and loved the open area with bandstand, comfy chairs and cornhole games to entertain.  Overall, a solid 4/5 but once spa is open and \"normal\" post Covid life resumes, I'm sure this will be a 5 star location.  We will come again and will update after we do."

We had reservations for a Saturday arrival, we called and spoke with the most unpleasant human on this planet named (Becca-Becky-Rebecca) you get the idea, not sure on the spelling so lets go with (B) - The interaction went something like this:   (Scott): Hi, we have a confirmation for checking in on Saturday, we noticed the check-in time is 4pm, we have a wedding to attend at 5pm... is there any chance to check-in slightly early maybe 3-3:30 so we have time to get ready, and also make the 30 minute drive to the venue?   (B): What is your definition of early since you stated the check-in time is 4pm which is the actual check-in time.   (Scott): Oh, ok.. well let me get with the wife and figure it out, thanks. Bye.   (B): Phone Click  Now I'm basically just flabbergasted at that point, like whoa... did this really just happen?   Long story short, we called in the following days and decided to cancel the reservation, we spoke with Susan who was amazing, and apologized! She Stated that (B) comes across that way sometimes, and she will bring it up to her. Anyways, it's sad that (B) was the ultimate factor in the loss of revenue for the resort. Being a Titanium Elite Marriot member, I average over 75 nights a year at various hotels, NEVER in my life have I had a similar interaction. Wish we got to try the wine, maybe another time....."

We were able to choose five wines from the extensive list of award winning wines. He graciously poured the wines we chose, with knowledgeable notes and recommendations. The Grenache Rose, dry and tasty. Plateau Red was a delicious blend. Tempranillo true to the varietal. The Brut was a delightful and Dominum Tinto Port so luscious. Cody was Texas friendly and a true ambassador of the wine region."

                "description": "4 star review, mainly for the beautiful setting they've created. It's pretty ingenious to put up a resort and spa out in Hill country. They're going to make a ton when things get back to \"normal.\" It's connected to the 290 brewery and restaurant where we ate dinner. They provided us complimentary wine tasting. I wouldn't go home to mom on the wines but the food we ordered hit the spot. We sat inside where it was easy to socially distance and enjoy our meals and tastings. Outside was packed and people were definitely not distancing over the holiday weekend. I think the brewery could do a better job at pushing tables further apart to try to account for this. The service was a bit slow but nothing to complain about since we were enjoying the AC room.   some of the disappointments were more towards the resort. They seemed to be a little understaffed since we couldn't even check in at 5 when the booking said check in started at 4. The pool was packed the evening prior which meant no clean towels when we went the morning of our check out. The continental breakfast was cheap and limited to individual prepackaged muffins, cereal, cereal bars and yogurt. I understand covid limits what they could cook, but even hard boiled eggs wouldn't be that difficult.  The staffing was otherwise welcoming and friendly and wearing face masks. Parking is limited to the upper area so you have to walk down to your cabin. Would also recommend a better walk way to the restaurant, but we loved the wild flowers and it was a nice reprieve from the day in the sun."

EXCEPT.... the Migas from  the breakfast menu, The Migas are terrible. Hands down the absolute worst Migas I've ever had. There is no eggs at all in the meal, what kind of Migas has no eggs? it's just bad.  Their \"Migas\" are really more like brisket nachos. They need to either rename the meal to Nachos, or revamp it, or just remove it from the menu. So.... Stay here for a great time but just DO NOT order the Migas for breakfast."

                "description": "Not at all what I was expecting! We were very disappointed overall. We planned an overnight near Fredericksburg and booked here fully expecting to visit the restaurant which is only open Thursday through Sunday. We were staying on a Tuesday night. We also planned to book spa services but the spa isn't open yet.  After attempting to turn onto the driveway which has no lights near it whatsoever we had to u-turn further up the road and attempt again. Not being from the area, you cannot see the driveway at all so I'd definitely suggest arriving before nightfall.  Upon arriving at reception, the representative had the personality of a turtle. She was not friendly nor rude. She was merely there. It was a \"No, the restaurant isn't open. No, the spa opens next year.\"  It'd been nice to know this prior to booking as we would've booked elsewhere. The price point wasn't cheap through Hotels.com either for nothing being open at $160 + tax.  Our room was beautiful and smelled like new construction. The room itself was a perfect suite and would accommodate three people perfectly with a twin pull-out couch in the living area and a king bed in the bedroom. We really loved the bathroom with double vanity, large shower and separate water closet.  The room included a small refrigerator, coffee pot and bathrobes. Although the bathrobes are not \"one size fits all\" and tend to run on the smaller side.  Overall we'd stay here again if the price point were the same or close to the same and the resort is more operational."

Sure, the wine won't taste like Napa Valley or Santa Ynez, but beggars can't be choosers during a pandemic. However, the owner started his first winery in Temecula in 2003.  We received two vouchers at check in for either a tasting or a single glass of wine.  The overnight resort is GORGEOUS! I wished they delivered meals from the Old 290 Brewery, but I understand it's covid. Each villa has its own separate entrance so there's no risk of catching covid from other guests. These are brand new villas, only one year old, and they're beautifully built! Beautiful upgraded bathrooms and everything is new. There are two tvs in each villa plus a gas fireplace! Four star hotel which allows dogs!  It's located fifteen minutes from Andalucia Distillery, Hill Country Lavender, and the Exotic Resort Zoo."

From the moment we checked in we were promptly greeted and given our rooms. While visiting we had the opportunity to eat lunch and dinner at this place and the food was really great! Kudos to the chef for the wonderful food and great pairings of wines. This was truly a fantastic visit and stay. While having lunch one day, we got to meet and visit with the owner Jim was who a great and friendly man and made us feel very welcome. He introduced to balsamic vinegar and it was amazing! This is definitely a must buy when visiting. Additionally, he told his story about this winery and it was a great story! Some employees who really stood out were Sheldon, Ethan, Marcus, and Dee! Thank you to the entire Carter creek staff for making our stay and meeting an excellent one. We will definitely be back to enjoy the Carter creek experience! If you are in the area, this is must stop especially on Fridays and Saturdays when they have some live bands. Nothing beats a hill county evening with some wine, food and friends."

The restaurant on the property was not open on Monday and Tuesday. This was also a huge disappointment. You receive two vouchers per room for the wine tasting on property.

                "description": "What a lovely, relaxing place - truly Zen. Stayed on a gorgeous November weekend with a group of long-time friends. Staff in the winery were very accommodating and helped us make our selections, which we purchased, and then moved out into large, comfy chairs in the open courtyard/lawn area to listen to music and enjoy the views and conversation. Later in the evening, had dinner outside from the Old 290 Brewery and Restaurant. Staff thankfully moved a heater by us on this chilly fall evening, and everyone enjoyed various dishes. All the food was excellent, and we even caught a glimpse of Mr. Carter himself dining in the restaurant. Later in the evening, we sat around the fire pit at the pool, and made new friends with other guests. Special shoutout to bartender, Taylor, who truly went above and beyond in catering to our group and making sure we had everything we needed. Could not have been a more pleasant, perfect weekend! Thanks!"

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

Some girl friends and I came to Fredericksburg for a long weekend and did two back-to-back tours with her. The first tour on Friday was with another group and they had already decided to do wine so we were able to join in with them and had a blast touring the local wineries. She also took us to a local watering hole afterwards when we decided we all wanted to stay out for a bit longer. She was amazingly accommodating and super fun!! On Saturday we wanted to tour some distilleries and breweries and she helped us decide which ones were more along the atmosphere we were looking for. Carla is amazing and I can't recommend her enough!!"

                "description": "My best friend and sister planned a weekend bachelorette party for me complete with a wine and art tour. The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

He had so many tips and was so kind. I will be using his company again, hopefully have him as our driver for another girls weekend. I cannot say enough good things.   Leading up to this weekend I was researching several private transportation companies. One of them had hidden costs.

But the moment your tour starts, Clint takes away all your worries and concerns, and created a fun atmosphere filled with lots of knowledge and wine tasting! If you're looking for a sommelier who knows his stuff, Clint is your guy! If you want your sommelier to not be pretentious, again, Clint is your guy!

We were looking for a mixture of red and white wines as well as making a stop at a brewery. As this trip was taken to relax a bit we opted to go a more relaxing atmosephere. The three stops that we made were great and weren't typical touristy places which made it even better. Chris was our tour guide and he was awesome!! He gave us recommendations of where to eat, information about the areas, and overall was very personable! We couldn't have asked for a better tour guide, he took all of our bags back to the car, he mentioned that he had umbrellas just in case, and was great about letting us know that he was on his way and that there was a little delay. This company isn't like others, they listen to what you are looking for in the experience and there were no problems! Chris even found our airbnb that was a bit off the beaten path.

                "description": "Booked a tour with Cellar Rat during the first day of our trip to Fredericksburg since we had never been.  We thought a tour would be a good way to get our bearings.  We stayed just out of town on the west side of 490 so our \"wine\" tour started with a quick tour of main street which was helpful later when making dining decisions and deciding our our tourist stops.  Clint was very knowledgeable about the town, the wineries, wine in general, and very personable.  He had all our stops planned out and tastings booked.  Definitely relaxing to have all that handled for you so you can enjoy your vacation.  The tours are somewhat determined by the agenda/goal of the people on the tour meaning you stops might be different.  I was told some tours are based on the best views, best wines, and possibly distillery tours if that is of interest.  We wanted an idea of what the area had to offer which took us to Kuhlman, William Chris, and Astris.  We also had some samples during lunch at Hye Market which was a great stop as well.   Several stops included a tour of the grounds and a behind the scene look at the production side of wine making.  We ended the trip that day with about a dozen bottles of wine, a mix of reds and white, which is a testament to the quality of the stops and wines the area has to offer as we primarily drink dry red wines; typically pinot noirs.  Would definitely recommend Rat Cellar and look forward to touring with them again next trip."

On the day of the tour, Chris picked us up on time and gave us an overview of what we could expect throughout the day. We had a lot of questions and he answered them well.   Our group stopped at Kuhlman Cellars, William Chris and Pedernales. Having worked in the industry, Chris was able to get us some \"behind the scenes\" looks at the wineries. He also was patient when we wanted to have another glass at certain wineries. Not to mention, he was always willing to help us document the trip with a picture!  I can't forget to mention we also had lunch at Hye Market where we got to taste some of the Cellar Rat wines! They were great! The restaurant itself is in a post office that is still operating and looks like it did back when it opened decades ago. Chris was also sure to make sure we had snacks and water throughout our trip!  I would highly suggest booking Cellar Rat Wine Tour to learn more about Texas wine culture and the area."

You are treated to such a fun experience with delicious wines (and not to mention, plenty of learning), good food, and a great travel buddy and conversationalist to boot. Some may argue the company is pricey considering the available wine shuttles, but it is SO worth it. You get plenty of attentiveness, the day is laid-back with ZERO planning on your part, and you get home at the end of the day feeling great and hopefully, with some delicious wine.  I love Cellar Rat Wine Tours and would highly recommend to anyone hoping to check out the wine scene around the Fredericksburg area."

He was also really nice about rounding up our group to leave to the next winery....we weren't always good listeners regarding the leaving part!! Lol!!! Great memories were made and our group even became friends and met out later! Even calling the place to set up was simple. The company was very helpful in setting up where we should go...ex- I said my sister and I only liked dry wines. Out of 19 samples...only ONE wine was sweet! Perfect trip!--we visited William Chris, Kuhlman and Pedernales. Our fave---WILLIAM CHRIS! They were all nice though!!!"

We had a 11 people with us for the tour so were in their largest tour van, and even with the large number of people Clem was able to keep the tour feeling small and intimate.   2 of the 11 people were very interested in the actual wine making process and Clem to the extra time to discuss more in depth the process as well as show the group the actual wine cellar where the wine was stored.   Lunch was provided in the cost and this made this tour group even more attractive to us, as all the other tour groups we looked at did not provide that.   If you're looking for more of a personalized tour from an experienced professional, this tour is definity with the price of admission.   Cheers!"

Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood.

We hit up 3 wineries and a distillery that made moonshine. Each one was small and unique where we were really able to  converse with the staff and talk about the wines.

We did the tour that consisted of two wineries and lunch in Fredricksburg. It was great!  Brandy and Matt think of everything! We were picked up in a clean van right at our hotel, so don't worry if you don't have a car! Matt even bring out a step stool so you don't have strain to get into the car. I didn't need it necessarily, but I did enjoy that extra touch. They gave us goodie bags while we drove to the country side. Matt is very knowledgeable and is a great guide of the area. He is full of little facts about the area!   The wineries we went to were very cool! Sister Creek was in an old cotton gin and more personal. Becker's was more upscale and large. we ended up getting 6 bottles of wine altogether. I was so surprised by the amount of good wine grown in Texas! Who knew?!!  Pros:  Brandy and Matt think of everything!  Don't worry about paying anything at the wineries- they take care of that! Transportation Good wine Great tour of the area Brandy and Matt are friendly and great at conversation They really know their stuff and love to explain anything about wine!  Cons:  I had a hankering for some cheese! But that's all I can think of!"

We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).   Be it an afternoon with a group of friends, or a romantic day for two, All About Central Texas is an outstanding choice.  Thanks for everything, Kim!"

I did the Fredericksburg tour and based on my wine preferences she had some great suggestions on which ones to stop in, there are so many! I even joined a wine club, the tastings were informative and she is just a lot of fun and I didn't have to worry about driving or directions and could enjoy the pours and some snacks.  I highly recommend All abt Central Texas tours, they are personable, you can really get to meet the others in these small groups- Thanks so much!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

My driver clearly had everything under control, so I was able to relax with my friends and start the party as soon as we got on the bus!  Our kids were so jealous when they saw the cool bus their moms' were leaving them in!  Honestly, the bus could have driven us anywhere and we would have had a good time, but Santos' attention to picking great vineyards and James' attnetion to keeping us on schedule made everything perfect!  Our group was different than most -- in that we wanted to take it slow and just relax and were not too concerned about whether we made it to all three destinations.  We also had some nursing moms and wanted to be sure everyone was accomodated.  James was very accomodating and once I conveyed that we were more relaxed he made sure we had all the time we needed.  I also felt like the driving was very safe and overall the attention to safety was as it should be.  The price was reasonable, as well.  All in All, Keep Austin Wet made our vineyard tour perfect!"

                "description": "What a great experience! I cannot speak highly enough about Austin Wet Bus. Santos was so enthusiastic about hosting our party, which was a welcome relief as that is not always the response you get from tour companies when you tell them you're a bachelorette party--no matter how well-behaved you may be! Our driver, James, was wonderful and so helpful the entire day, especially at the end when we elected to add another hour and an extra stop; he catered his recommendation to our needs (gluten intolerant guests + casual interest in beer and liquor) and we had an amazing experience. You can't beat the pricing, but for what we paid our experience definitely exceeded every expectation. Thank you so much for everything, and we look forward to using you again in the future!"

We started at William Chris, headed to Pedernales and ended at Augusta Vin. The 15 passenger van was great for our group of 11. They offered water and took care of checking us in at each winery. David was a complete gentleman and carried all of our purchases and secured them in the van while we enjoyed our time tasting the different wines. He even dropped us off downtown so we would be on time for our dinner reservation."

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating.

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.

We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

The owners, Robert and Melissa, promptly returned my calls/texts with any questions I had before the night of the booking. The fee for the evening was wonderfully priced compared to other companies I had called around and gotten quotes from.  I highly recommend Austin Nites Party Bus based on my experience with them."

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home.

                "description": "10/10 would recommend Moon's Vineyard Voyages to anyone looking for a good time in Fredericksburg! Ginger was the absolute best driver and guide!! We had a group of 6 ladies on our trip and it was easy to communicate and book our tour with Moon's Voyages. We did the half-moon tour on a Saturday morning/afternoon. Ginger arrived at our Airbnb with the bus on time and after picking up other people at their various locations, we reached 4.0 Cellars for our first tasting. Our second tasting was at Hye Meadow Winery followed by lunch at Hye Market, where our lunches were ready on the table for us! We finished the day at Fat Ass Ranch and Winery before all being taken back to our respective locations. All 3 tastings were amazing! We never felt rushed or that we were on any type of time crunch. We were able to enjoy every glass and had no worries about who would have to be the designated driver. Ginger was so much fun and the absolute sweetest! She made our tour a blast by keeping us safe and making us laugh!"

                "description": "If you're staying In Fredericksburg and want to do a wine tour, be sure to call up Brandon at Moon's Vineyard Voyage. My boyfriend surprised me with this during our weekend getaway. Brandon was super friendly and knowledgeable of the area and the different things to do in Fredericksburg. He picked everyone up from where they were staying, which was awesome. The first place he took us was to was Fiesta Winery. This place was my absolute favorite! We were allowed to pick 6 wines to try and we got to keep our tasting glasses. I got lucky and liked all 6 of mine! The next stop was the Garrison Brothers Distillery. Bourbon on a wine tour?! Super unique. This consisted of a tour of the distillery and we learned how bourbon was made. We got to try it every stage of the process. And they also taught us how to enjoy a glass of bourbon. It wasn't my cup of tea, however it was a cool experience and my boyfriend loved it! For lunch, we had some awesome sandwiches at the Hye Market. Super yummy! Our last stop was the Hye Meadow Winery. Also a cute winery. We had such a great time on this tour. Brandon gave us his card and told us to call him directly if we ever want to do it again, that way we don't do the same tour twice. We live up the road in Austin, so we definitely will be coming back very soon!  Pro tip, eat before you go on this tour! You will be drinking a lot!"

She kept us up to date on how much longer we had at each winery so we could time our experience appropriately. She also made sure everyone got free water if they wanted it. Anything that was purchased was also taken to the van for us and stored safely! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to experience the wineries in Fredericksburg!"

He picked us up at our hotel and took a ton of pictures for us at each stop. Immediately after one of us purchased something, he wrote our names on it and stored it safely on the bus. He allowed us to hook up our bluetooth in the bus so we can have our own choice of music. We never once felt rushed to get to the next winery, either! Among the things already mentioned, he provided bottled water, opened all the doors for us, and gave us great Fredericksburg recommendations!"

My husband and I were taking a few days off after our wedding and this was a great activity. We tried great wine and beers and everything was already setup for us when we arrived at each place. They all had a heads up about our recent nuptials too apparently, and made sure to take care of us :)   We ended up in a private limo which was a lot of fun but sounds like a great options for groups too!

We were the only ones who showed up--others cancelled due to gas situation after Hurricane Harvey. He was kind enough to drive us to Luckenbach just so we could have our picture taken. Hen was knowledgable, affable, and gracious even though this wasn't a very profitable day for him. He gave us a great selection of wineries based on our preferences and we had a nice sandwich lunch at Hye Market. He even carried the boxes of wine/beer to our hotel room."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

Our guide, George, was amazing. He knew so many of the local places it was staggering. His knowledge and history in the area is unrivaled. George has a passion for this and it shows and is appreciated. I personally enjoyed being able to ride in their brand new car with seating fit for a king and space to tote all of our collections along the way. If we ever find ourselves back in the area, this will be our first call!"

As a thoughtful bonus, George graciously took photos to ensure memories of our group and surprised us with lovely photos of the places we visited to capture the ambiance as well.

They are absolutely fantastic. This company is top notch and I highly recommend them. I just came back from visiting the area with my sisters and niece. We booked a 4hr reservation with Kirchman's, so that we could visit 3 wineries for tastings. George, our driver, was so kind and accommodating. He even took photos of us at each winery and texted them all to me. The vehicle used for transporting us was nice and clean. He offered us bottled water and kept our wine purchases safe at our various stops. Whenever we were ready to head to the next location, all I had to do was text him that we were walking out and he rolled right on up in the car. Convenient and awesome customer service! I will definitely use them again next time I visit the area."

                "description": "Had a fantastic time visiting the Fredericksburg wine country with Valet for a Day. We had 6 adults, but our bus would have easily held double that (I didn't count the seats).  Rick was our main point of contact for inquiries, as well as our driver for the day. He was super easy to work with and helped us figure out what we really wanted to do. We had to get picked up from the Horseshoe Bay Resort (which is about an hour from Fredericksburg). So, we were able to visit two wineries (Becker and Bingham) and one distillery (Garrison Brothers). Garrison Brothers was the favorite by far and we ended up eating lunch there, too. Garrison also has tours starting at 10 while most wineries don't start until 11. Rick helped me work out a feasible schedule and then I had to book the tours themselves (which was more of a challenge than I thought because you're trying to coordinate specific times for specific places and one site will time out before you finalize, etc). So, by the time those were booked, we ended up having to alter our schedule and Rick was great about it. He showed up on time. The bus itself was fabulous. He had custom coffee orders ready for us, plus sodas and water onboard, as well as snacks (bags of chips, crackers, Snackens, etc). We were on time for every tour and never felt rushed. We were also back on time, which was important to me since we had to pick up our kids from the kids club. We paid a deposit up front and the balance a few days before our tour. Then, we paid tips in cash on the day of. I would absolutely recommend them and would use them again."

He was very thorough making sure he knew times and where to pick us up. I never once had to follow up with him while planning, or even day of, because he was always very proactive in checking in on our details. He and his wife renovated the bus, and it has an awesome, comfortable, yet trendy vibe. He had waters and cokes for us on the bus, and his wife made homemade cookies for my husband's birthday! And he took coffee orders to have ready for everyone after a fun day at the wineries! It was a very custom experience, and he made it easy and enjoyable. We will definitely be calling him when we come for our next trip!"

You had to enter (with a dog) through a crowded patio with other dogs. I luckily found 2 chairs not being used at a table to pull aside, but oh lord. There were kids EVERYWHERE. I can handle well behaved kids but there were probably 5 kids per every adult there. It was madness. They were running all over and several times the poor guy delivering food to tables was almost tripped up by them. Our dog was super overwhelmed by parents not watching their kids running up to him.  My husband went to get us beer while I waited outside with the dog, and it took him at least 15mins the line was so long. The beer deserves 5 stars but our dog (and us) were so uncomfortable with how crowded and crazy it was, that we left after quickly sharing a flight. I'd come back, but it would only be right when they opened, and not for very long, considering they're this crowded often.  I definitely don't feel like they took distancing or mask-wearing seriously....my husband and I were the only ones outside wearing them when not at our seated area.  Oh, and the sewage smell is so insane. Rotten eggs bad. Hard to enjoy a good beer with that constant smell. Reminded me of Twisted X Brewing."

Kids and dogs and beer and barbecue on the nachos.  Beer was good, but less offerings than most breweries.  But it was good and we would recommend this place to anyone."

                "description": "The space is a modern farmhouse look with high ceilings and clean, modern lines and the outside area has plenty of seating and trees for shade. Aesthetically it is close to perfect, but I have to knock a point off for the food. We ordered the smokehouse nachos and while they were delivered promptly, they were barely warm with cold pieces of brisket. I have to say, I'm amazed they can find anyone to deliver orders to, since you only get a table card for them to locate you, but in our case, we were seated close to the door, so he came straight to us. The beer was okay and I had the cider mimosa. Another thing I was less excited about, but didn't take points off for, was the number of children running around the place. There is a large playscape outside and as a parent whose child was once young, I get wanting to have places that are kid friendly, but that's just not my jam anymore. Again, I don't fault the place for that, but it'd probably make me less likely to return."

Good food.  Interesting beer.  Don't bother with the Mac and cheese as it's very reminiscent of Kraft that you can make at home.  The fried chicken tenders were just ok.  The sausage sampler platter was tasty.  They had other items on the menu that looked good but we didn't have a chance to try them this go-round.  The Barbados Stout was a fine stout.  The Wee Scottish was more unique but wasn't as peaty as I would like, but was still tasty."

The staff is amazing and the inside space is clean and spacious which is great for social distancing. I ordered the Aussie Ale and loved it. I have ordered the specials here and crab cakes and they were amazing. Everything on the food list is great. We have a 4 year old who loved the playscape. If you want a quieter setting away from the kids you can go further back on the property to enjoy your beer. The restrooms were clean and the place is dog friendly. The outdoor area also had shade and tons of seating. I personally am not a beer snob so I can't fully critique the beer but I will say that having a place like this to go to and relax with the pup and kid in tow is amazing. They have also great cider and wine to choose from. Highly recommend all around."

                "description": "First time here, indoor and outdoor seating, walk up service, food truck with pizza. Beverage selection: beer, soft drinks and some drink creations they make from their beers. Beer selection was over a dozen, about half  were IPAs. No porters, no stouts, especially for this time of year.  Overall sampling of selections was nothing to rave about, very little body and no depth in flavor. Bar staff was polite and busing the entire place. Unisex bathrooms need regular attention, bar staff should not have to do that too.  Overall impression: we won't drive to Dripping for Twisted X as a destination in the future."

They wanted to write the credit card information on a piece of paper with other customers CC info. We refused.   Sidney, said that my attitude was not good. Sorry, Sidney you are not good at this business.  Your problem is not our problem.  Will not return all due to a horrible experience from Sidney."

                "description": "Just 11 miles from Jester King, sits another awesome brewery, Twisted X. Good brewery ambience with both indoor and outdoor seating.  A food truck offering tacos and other Mexican snacks is parked on the premises.    Beer offerings are good with a varied selection.  Available on the day we visited, was chupaHOPra IPA, Mango IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Zwickle, Pilsner, Lager, Pale Ale and a few guest beers.  Flights available, $2 a taster for a very generous pour. Good flavor profiles to the ones we sampled.  2 bathrooms available. Out of toilet paper and not very clean on the day we were there.  Dogs are welcome, however, the outside seating area isn't huge.  Cornhole outside and the COOLEST carved tree you have ever seen!  Worth a stop and a beer just to appreciate the giant gargoyle and sombrero-wearing iguana."

I can't say I had had Twisted X beer before (or maybe I have and it wasn't memorable). The location is nice and quiet, with a ton of outdoor seating. However, the sewage smell was overwhelming! The inside was large and open but was crowded and was so loud. I don't know- I was impressed with the building, but not the beer, and definitely not the smell."

I love getting out to dripping springs and getting out of the city. The leaves are changing and it's just a wonderful drive through hill country  We got there and were greeted with friendly faces. We got a few beers then went on a tour. Very cool behind the scenes look of how they do everything in house!  Came back and told the bar manager we trusted him to put together a flight for us. And he delivered. All the beers were delicious.   We very much so enjoyed our time there! We also enjoyed that there is a food truck serving delicious pizzas! Daniele' did great!!"

This day at the Brewery was cool and so sitting outside was great - as was the beers. This is such a great space, and the service here was fantastic. They also had someone playing acoustic guitar - which only added MORE to the cool factor.   I can see spending many more days here in my future."

On the Sunday that we visited it was too darn hot to enjoy their patio even with their Big Ass Fan. Inside was cool and comfy as we ordered a couple of their taproom only specialty brews and enjoyed the live music. A shoutout to the guitar player who finished his set with a great Spanish guitar-led song.   So bring the mutt and your kiddos (there is plenty of room for both them to run around outside) and enjoy a few of their wonderful craft beers.  Be sure to check out their website for taproom only beers and new releases!"

The brewery has nice curbside appeal.  The structure is nicely done and their is a little area for the doggies.  Of note, dogs are also allowed in the tasting room.   There is also a food truck there.  The inside is your typical tasting room with an industrial look.  It is nicely done.  The bartenders are good.    The prices are right.  I would recommend the flight so you can try ones.  I really think they do a good job on the IPAs.  Their beers are quite good.   But of all of them, i favor the Chupahopra!"

It's not a huge place, but they have tables and chairs outside, an outdoor patio section and then some indoor. You can also sit at the bar. They had live music while we were there (a single guy and a guitar which was pleasant and not overwhelming, and there is a food truck on site. Plenty of parking as well.   We told the girl behind the bar it was our first time, and she did a great job of talking about the beers. I'm not an IPA fan so she recommended the German lager, which I found to be delicious. My friend got the mango IPA which he also liked a lot. And a good price at $5 per glass.   They have tours twice a day but we missed it as well as merch for sale. All in all, I found it to be a great place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon and it's in close proximity to Salt Lick and other wineries/breweries. Definitely make it part of the list to stop at!"

                "description": "I came to Texas earlier this month for vacation. One of the places I was dying to try was this specific beer Company. When our party arrived, it was slow. but there were only a few tables, and they were taken. It was cold outside, so we decided to stay inside and use the side table against the wall. this was fine, but then a table opened up and we got it. We went to the front to order and the I felt like I was interrupting the staff's conversation. I asked their opinion regarding the products, and they pointed to the menu on the wall. I already read the menu; I was referring to any we should try since we only got 4 on a flight. No Matter, we chose then headed to our table. They said it would be ready in a bit. ok... we sat and began talking about all sorts of stuff. after about 5 minutes, we were looking around towards the front to see if they were ready since it should have taken only a minute or so to get 4 flights poured. we are looking over and nothing. After about 10 minutes, a staff member came to the table and advised us our flights were sitting in the front. REALLY?! she came over, she could have brought them. At the VERY MINIMUM, could have told us something, flagged us down or anything to get our attention. Nope, just let the beers sit there while they went back to their conversation. We asked about food and they said the food is on the table in the form of a QR Code. ok... we looked around and was not busy at all, so we wanted to get some food. the wait time was like 40 minutes! there wasn't anyone there! Maybe 6 other people in the entire place.  The Magic of Dean Winchester Beerpub went POOF with that experience. The Glider was G*****E Black Beauty, Cabo, Cosmic Cowboy and Kick out the Yams was Awesome.  Not Likely to return to this Pub, ever. But will likely buy the beers (Mentioned above) if I see them in the stores.  Maybe staff was having a bad day. I dont know but that was my Experience"

You walk into a huge room and at the end is a small counter.  We had never been so didn't really know where to order or know anything about the beers. The people I were with are from Oregon and saw the owner on some show. I was hoping to show them awesome Austin hospitality but these chicks that were running the place seemed pissed to have to help anyone.  They finally ordered and we went outside to grab a table. About 10 minutes later I noticed other people having drinks but not the people I was with. I went up to the counter and all their flights were sitting on the bar. We had NO idea they were ready or that we had to wait for them. I have to say, if you expect a tip you have to work. They looked smug when I went up there and asked if they were ours. Anyway, service was a ZERO star.  The only thing I liked was the strawberry pizza. It sounds crazy but it was awesome! Not a lot of crust, just the right amount of cheese and it was huge! The pretzel, just don't! It's a Sysco frozen thing that was microwaved. Just stick with the pizza!  We won't be back but I sure hope I can find that pizza somewhere!"

I don't know anything about beer but I had a flight with the lightest beers. They were all easy to drink, tasted like any other beer but I'm definitely not a connoisseur. The vibe is very laid back, lots of outdoor seating and there was live music. I ordered some Cosmic Cowboy cans to go and my fault for not checking, but I only received 1 Cosmic and the other 2 were Golden Age so that sucked. The guy almost forgot to give them to me in the first place when I went to pick up my merch (you can order online. I got a shirt, glass, magnet).  Very happy I got to go, just wish I had gotten what I ordered."

                "description": "Delicious pizza, lots of beer options, great grounds, but admittedly not what I was hoping for. My family are Supernatural fans and considering the name of the establishment is a cute nod to Jensen Ackles' role in the show, we had hoped there would be some spooky theming to the establishment, maybe some fun photos or props, but there wasn't anything of the like! Anyone walking in who wasn't a fan simply wouldn't even know. A bit disappointing because while it was pleasant, it wasn't unique-- just a brewery in the hill country. *shrugs*  Ignoring my own hopeful expectations, as I said, we had a lovely time. It wasn't too busy on a Thursday night, and the staff were good about roaming occasionally to see if guests needed anything and to inform us about last call on food and later beer. We sat at one of the outdoor picnic tables and ordered with the QR code; received a text when things were ready for us to pick up. There's also some seating indoors if that's preferred. Noticed there was an area inside for a band set-up, though there wasn't anyone playing while we were there. Water is available in coolers both inside and on the patio.  Nice restrooms are clean and chic. The playground is pretty fun if you've brought munchkins. There is also the ever-popular Texas-favorite Cornhole. If it's a moist day, the ground may be a bit muddy, fair warning. The parking lot is all gravel. Turn is easy to find thanks to numerous signs along the way guiding you to the entrance."

The hostess informed us there was a bit of a wait for the pizza and told us to put in our order as soon as possible. We got on it immediately and then figured out why she told us that - after an hour wait, we finally got our pizza.  No biggie though because the drinks are available as soon as you order them and there's a playground for the kids to play at so they weren't driving us crazy while we were waiting to eat.  The pizza was delicious! We got the pepperoni, carnivore, and Hippie and all of them were great! They're a thin crust, so you'll eat more than you think you'll want. The Hippie was my favorite.  We had such a great time listening to the band play and enjoying the perfect 70° spring weather.  We'll definitely be back!"

                "description": "Horrible place! Had some friends stay with us from out of town. They wanted to check this place out because of Jensen Ackles from Supernatural blah blah blah. Anyways we went there on a Friday evening. Being first timers we took a minute to look at their menu. You can tell we were new because we couldn't decide on which beer to get. The cashier just stood there looking at us like we were wasting her time. No offer to help or description of any beer. So we order a couple of flights, paid for it and looked for a seating indoors. Not enough seating indoors by the way especially for a big party. We would have sat outside except it was about 30 degrees. About 10 minutes go by we were wondering what was taking so long to get our beers then the cashier walks up to our table and says \" your flights have been sitting at the counter, we pour it right away, you have to go get it. We don't call names or anything.\" WTH!!! Well that would have been nice if she would have told us when we were at the counter. Maybe say something like \" hey it will be a few minutes wait here while we get your drinks\". I don't know something like that or any type of communication. We get our drinks and of course they are warm now. Wanted to order food and she says there is one pizza food truck outside no food served in the establishment. She says to order online. So we look online and it says 30-45 min wait for food. I don't understand why it would take so long, There was barely anyone there.  There was our party of 6 and about four other people in there. Also a few days later I see an extra charge of $4.33. We only ordered two flights which came out to $21.65. We didn't leave a tip or anything because obviously they weren't deserving of one. However, I guess they felt the need to tip themselves. Yes, it's only about $4 but you get a tip when I give you a tip. What you did was steal from paying customers. Please avoid this place like the plague. Nothing great about this place. They pride themselves on the name Family Business, bring your whole family here. Ha! what a joke! Is this how you treat your family? You rob them blind?!"

The service is all ordered online and then you get a text to pick up your drinks or food. It was a cozy place with a great selection of beers. Flights were only $10 so we took advantage of that! The also had pretty good pizza."

You can order pizza from the food truck. We had the amazing.   Beers are all pretty good. The Grackle, Cosmic IPA and the Hamilton Pool Pale ale were my favorites. I was surprised at how refreshing the IPA was and happy with the flavors of the Grackle, a not too heavy imperial stout.   Would love to head back with our kids next time as the venue was wonderful."

The outdoor seating area had hardly any grass and the tables were pretty weathered and covered in ants. The playground was great for the kids, but not enough to bring us back."

The beer is good, the pizza and salads are good (vegan/ non-dairy cheese available), and the setting is FANTASTIC. They have picnic tables outside in an oak grove. In the evening, string lights give the seating area a really warm and inviting vibe. I've sat at one of the tables at the edge of the property at dusk and watched a family of deer frolic nearby. You don't get that experience at a suburban strip mall restaurant.  Friendly dogs are welcomed here, as long as they remain leashed. There is even a pickup station with bags and a trash can.  The staff have all been SO friendly and welcoming every time we've gone. They'll occasionally have to remind people to please wear their masks, but this isn't a personal attack. They're just doing what they must to stay open!  Covid precautions: Masks are required for everyone unless seated at your table. You'll spend the vast majority of your time seated, so this is really not a big deal. The tables are far enough apart that this feels quite safe. The picnic tables have been covered with plastic table cloths, so they can be sanitized between patrons. The playground is currently closed, and there are no games or live music. Reservations through open table are required, to help with social distancing, but if they are not busy they will seat walk-ups.   I love this place even with everything being scaled back because of the pandemic. I can't wait to see how much more fun it will be once it is safe to fully reopen!  Things I would like to see: Cider as an option. Live music. A few more veggie choices."

                "description": "We went to Family Business with daughter and boyfriend on Sunday, December 27, for a pleasant family outing. It was so, with one exception. The positive first. The grounds are very pleasing, and FB is very careful to distance you, to sanitize between visits and to enforce mask wearing.   Their beers are well designed and creatively conceived. Cosmic Cowboy is a mildly rich, middle of the road offering and fun on the palate. Hamilton Pales is crisp with fruity tones and makes a great warm weather beer. Brieux Famille is my wife's favorite, though she usually prefers a beer that's one step beyond rainwater.  The downer was the guy in charge of passing out your beer order from inside the taproom. He was overly officious and rude. He liked the little bit of power he had, and he used it. I felt disrespected and insulted because I tried to sip my two beers down to a level such that I could carry it without spilling a bunch. I was doing that on the deck, not in the taproom, and he shouted me down. Daughter's boyfriend was offended on my behalf as well.  FB, please train your folks on how to handle customers with dignity. It's not only what you say, it's how you say it."

They've gone overboard with the outdoor masking and the covid precautions to the point where it's just not that great.  I hear some of the other establishments in the area aren't as bad re this.     I'd probably skip it until they see fit to remove the outdoor masking.    Definitely buy the beer in the store though. It's top notch."

This is on such a beautiful piece of land outside Austin, with mossy trees and buzzing air, and a big playground for you to set your kids on while you kick your feet up on the porch.

The hill country views are beautiful and I'd imagine sunsets here are gorgeous. Outdoor games available. Dogs on leash are allowed.   Lots of seating and an interesting idea on how to hold your seats/table. It was nice not having to worry about somebody taking our spot while playing with the animals. You can also get food for them at the bar. They were pretty gentle and didn't mind selfies.   Lots of beer, cider and wine options. I had the sweet Sangria (Messina Hof) and Cherry Cobbler by Martin House. Both delightful and fruity.   They have 2 food trucks: Gringas Grub Shak and Kelly's Hill Country BBQ. I went with Kelly's and got the Brisket Elote Parfait and it was so, so good. I want to go back just for that! There were so many options to choose from. There's really something for everyone. I'll definitely be back!"

Plenty of great drinks on tap as well as friendly bartenders.   The bae and I came here after a swim at the neighboring Blue Hole Regional Park. Short 11min drive will get you to Shady Llama from Blue Hole.  The star of the show is the petting zoo featuring the llama and two donkeys. You can get up and personal with the llama by feeding and petting. I was a little hesitant to get too close because who knows if he'll spit.  The view of Texas Hill Country is breathtaking and you could sit here for hours just taking it all in. There were two food trucks on site offering tacos and bbq.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: The vibe here was so nice. Great place to unwind after long day at the pool or chill with friends until dusk."

To your right, there is a small fence with adorable llama's you can feed and pet. I didn't get to try the food, but the bbq smelled incredible.

It the best of what the area wineries offer in terms of a place where you want to spend a leisurely couple of hours, with a great assortment of local craft beers on tap (and options for the non-beer drinkers).  I like that there is a variety of seating options (picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, barstools) and they are nicely spread out.  Aside from the view the main attraction is their resident llamas and mini donkeys, and trust me, splurge on the bag of feed for optimal up-close interaction with these adorable camelids!  | Beverages | A nicely curated selection of local beer on tap, and surely something to please everyone.  There's also a selection of cider, hard seltzer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages.    | Eats | We didn't eat here, but there's an onsite resident food trailer offering tacos, quesadillas and burgers."

The Shady Llama, just west of Wimberley on the way toward Dripping Springs on RR12 is a gem of a yard bar offering Texas-based craft brews, soft drinks, and wines with a killer view and a few furry mascots to feed and pet.  Our family loves this place. We can each enjoy a tasty beverage we like, have a good lunch from the Gringa's truck we like from Wimberley, and feed some alfalfa to some llamas and burros.  There are plenty of socially-distanced places to lounge around the terraced and tree-shaded yard, and everything is outdoors. It's actually perfect for pandemic times.  Pro-tip: do not try to come here during any weekend with special events in Wimberley, like Market Days or Rodeo. The parking lot has limited capacity. Lazy Sundays are the best time IMHO."

                "description": "Judging from the recent reviews, I guess I'm in the minority. But I miss pre-COVID Shady Llama.  It's just not the same and the magic is gone. Given that literally 100% of the place is outside,  their COVID protocols are way over the top.   Why do you need to assign picnic tables??   And all the hammocks are gone (risk of transmission is greater from canvas than wood??).  At least they stopped doing the inane requirement of reservations they were doing for a while.   So if you're uber paranoid and love restricted freedoms maybe it won't be an issue for you.    But it just made my wife and I sad to be back (1st time in a year and pre-pandemic we were regulars).   Yes they have good beer, and higher prices now to offset the fact that people obviously aren't flocking there like they used to.  And the view is great and it's fun to see the llamas and if you never went before maybe you'll be none the wiser.  But for me it's just a sad reminder of what it used to be and a testament to how much fear and paranoia have all but ruined our country.   I won't be back until they restore everything to pre-pandemic protocols."

Their table designation decor they give you at the front so you can claim your spot without fear of anyone scooping it up when you're grabbing a beer or going to gawk at the llamas or mini donkeys is adorbs and shows attention to detail and a winning customer service experience right off the bat.   The tables are spread out nicely and there's plenty of shaded options or exposed ones, depending on your tolerance for the sun/heat.   It's actually on top of a hill so you can get a lovely panoramic vista of Hill Country, so you better believe if you're there at sunset, you'll be getting a gorgeous setting to close out on.   They don't brew their own beer (or wine), so they offer up a glimpse of Texas' finest on tap, which I appreciate. During COVID, every order came with chips or a treat (from a Costco assortment), but there's also a taco truck in the back if you're looking for something a little more substantive.   Kid and dog friendly, and since there are cute animals roaming the grounds (but fenced away from the tables), there are a lot more kids also roaming the grounds, so if that's not your thing, this may not be the place for you ;)  They have 6 llamas and two mini donkeys, and while the guy checking us in made it seem a sighting of them is rare unless you get there right when they open because that's when feeding time is, they were ever present during our midday visit. You can purchase feed for $1/bag to lure them over, and so I have a feeling we just had an extra generous crowd that day that always kept them fence curious!"

The food was beyond what I expected from a lunch truck, it is delicious!

It ended up being a great find. The grounds are lovely and in November the weather was absolutely perfect. Their beer is pretty much all sour so be prepared for that. The goat tour was also really charming. When it was over there was a small hiking loop (I'm guessing a couple of miles?) that we were able to take.   Unfortunately we did not sample the pizza but that's on my \"to try\" list the next time we come back."

                "description": "Goats, beer, and pizza! What more could you want?   Goats: We went on the goat tour and it was really hard to figure out where to go and how it was going to start. Thankfully, we were able to find the tour group and it was so fun to hang out with the goats in the goat pen. Plus, ticket proceeds go to hopefully raising a new goat barn.   Beer: great! No complaints, would highly recommend.   Pizza: honestly, probably some of the best pizza I've had full stop, and likely the best in Austin (yes...better than pinthouse), which is mostly why I gave this place 5 stars. We got the Gus pizza and the hot honey really sealed the deal. The only downside was that it took about 90 minutes to get it! To be fair, I should have guessed that this place might be packed on the weekends and done some research beforehand. Right now, everything is ordered online (avoid picking the curbside option if you're onsite!) so you can see how long the wait time is before you go and potentially order ahead so that it's ready by the time you get there (we went on a Sat night).   Definitely recommend this as a unique Austin experience, especially if you're being friends or family from out of town. Even if you don't go on the goat tour, there is lots of space to roam around, people bring their kids and their dogs to just hangout.  There's also live music some nights. I just didn't like how the tour was a little chaotic at the beginning and how the food took a little long to come out (maybe some signs and a megaphone would be helpful haha)."

And with that track record it is safe to assume they're all tasty! Not sure if they make their own dough but it was a good with a nice crunch.  The beer selection is pretty wide as well. Pro tip is to ask for a flight even though it's not shown on their menu. That way you can taste a bit before ordering a whole pint!"

                "description": "Overall, jester king brewery was great. The grounds and location are beautiful.  There were some hit or misses with each dish I had, and the beer didn't win me over. I think why this was 4 stars because everything was just good, but the grounds and location made that 2 star go to a 4 star.   The tomatoe soup bisque was interesting. It was very watery. The flavor slowly grew on me. The grilled cheese was good, but small. I feel there needed to be another half or more bread for it.  There was too much soup to grilled cheese ratio for dipping.  The sage cookie truly grew on me. The flavor was intense and sweet. I took a bite and then needed a few mins to process this flavor.  Eventually I'd eat the whole thing.   The bread with dipping butter sucked. None of us liked this at all. I felt the bread was kinda hard, and I was expected warm bread but it was room temperate. Also, the butter it came with was super bland too.  The 2 beers i had were okay, but i felt the flavor was pretty bland. I was here back in February so maybe the batches they were working on then were not my cup of tea."

                "description": "LOVE it here, because Jester King is more than just a brewery. They also serve fresh pizza, have lots of land, have a walking trail, and also GOATS!!!   If you can, Jester King advises reservations to guarantee a spot. If not, they do accept walk-ins, but be warned it's based on availability. People spend more than the average time here to enjoy the amenities Jester King has to offer.   How it currently works: Check-in at the Pole Barn, order food from your phone using the QR code, pick up your food and order drinks at the Pole Barn, and find a seat either in the Beer Garden, The Hopyard, The Canopy or the Grotto.   The Hopyard is where we decided to settle just because it's away from the larger crowds at the Beer Garden, and you're next to the Goat Barn! I didn't find the smells of the goats too horrendous, but be warned on windy days, the dust kicks up heavily!  Brews, Ciders, and Wine is what Jester King has to offer in terms of beverages. You can also take some home with you by stopping at their shop! Jester King is pretty niche when it comes to their brews, as not only do they have pure cultures, but mixed as well. Get crazy brew people!"

I'm not a beer aficionado... my husband is and he seemed to enjoy the tour.  For me, it was all about their outdoor seating, good food options and live music. It's the perfect place to have a nice relaxed afternoon... hanging out with family and friends. We tried their root beer, a couple of different beers brewed on site. I had the Pilzner and it was the perfect drink for a hot afternoon. They offer a pretty impressive menu of starters and entrees. We did their Asian pizza and it was scrumptious. I've never had a pizza infused with Asian flavors and I Jester King does it right!"

You got to be up-close to day-old goats. Holding a baby goat is something you didn't know you needed to do until you try it.  Afterwards, we grabbed a table by the stage (yay live music) and got pizzas and pretzels to share. You can skip the pretzel. It was not good. The pizzas were great and it's a lovely experience to treat out-of-town guests to. It was a Thursday night."

We arrived around 4:30 on a Sunday and didn't realize we needed reservations. They said they don't like to turn people away so they gave us wristbands and let us stay, which we appreciated! The bartender poured a heavy glass of wine and explained the kitchen closes daily from 4-5, which I appreciated they're looking out for their staff and giving them a break. While we waited for the kitchen to reopen, we visited the goat farm! The goats were sooooo cute. They have numerous seating areas and a ton of trails around the area.   5 o'clock rolled around and we ordered a classic pizza, which was basic cheese, basil, and sauce. The pizza was full of flavor! It really reminded me of the pizzas I ate in Naples. Would definitely recommend! Great place to visit with larger groups of people as well."

Pre-pandemic they had an amazing selection of beers and a great seating area. They have taken that up a notch by constructing 3-4 more buildings with outdoor seating areas. Our favorite is the Goat Barn .. you get to sit under the shade of the trees while the kids can enjoy watching and playing with the goats.  They also have plans to build a vineyard and distillery in the area. Feels like very soon they will even build some housing and call it their own city   Please make reservations beforehand as the place gets full real fast"

                "description": "Had so much fun at Jester King! They had a ton of room to roam around and it's a great place to go with a group of friends! While none of us have kids, it is very kid friendly too! Best of all, they had goats!!  We ended up eating lunch there and had a wonderful wood fired pizza, salad, and cornbread and it was all delicious! The beer was good, but not my favorite. I love saisons and ordered one, but wasn't a huge fan.  Only downside was that it started to rain when we first got there and they did not have accommodations for us. They had some indoor seating, which was booked for other reservations and a few umbrellas, but not nearly enough. We had to book the reservation weeks in advance so we couldn't exactly just leave and come back another day. Luckily it slowed down after awhile!  All in all, I had a really great time. Big fan of the food and atmosphere and hope to see a wider variety fo beer!"

A ton of seating under the main structure, just outside of it or even in the upper terrace area. All the food we had were tasty. The one that we all loved was the mushroom pizza which came with chunks of garlic and flavorful mushrooms - a must order if you like mushrooms! The corn and olives were tasty too! We tried a variety of beers and all were superb. All around faves were the blueberry sour and the stout.   One thing I didn't care for were the porta-potties. Towards the end of the night I took the kids to wash their hands and there was no water. We checked the second porta pottie and the urinal was not flushed and had no water too. Not sure if the water gets shut off at a certain time but found this off putting. We then had to go towards the main bathroom further up back towards the property. With a brewery this big you'd think there'd be more restrooms."

You order from your phone and then receive texts when your orders are ready and then you go up to the pick up area to get both your beverages and food. The pizza is phenom and the sandwiches are a perfect option if you have someone dairy-free in your group.   There was a guy playing live music on the Saturday we were recently there; a wonderful bonus!"

We found this brewery just a few miles SW of Austin that just had STUNNING food! I had the chicken tortilla soup which was probably the best I've ever had. I also got a pair of chicken quesadillas while my wife got the pork tacos. Everything including the chips N queso was just great.   The vibe was relaxed and easy going, it was quiet enough to enjoy the Motown music mix, our servers were friendly, the prices quite reasonable, and food was delivered within minutes. We finished off the night with a flight of ice cream. Oh yeah -- the beer was good too. We're bringing all of our friends here first chance we get."

                "description": "Over the weekend we had the opportunity to travel down to Austin and stay at the brewery in our Airstream. This was a fabulous place! The beer that they are brewing is unique and flavorful, along with traditional street tacos and Mexican fare, which can be pretty competitive in Austin.   When we first go there, I asked for a Topo Chico, which they don't have because they have something much better!  If you want something refreshing to clean the palette before you start trying different beers, order the Hop Water! It is amazing!  I really have to commend the staff, because they were friendly, attentive to our needs, and fast.  That is a challenge in today workforce, and there is nothing worse than having great food and crappy service.   While the beer and food was delicious - the one thing that stood out as exceptional was the ice cream flight. That is a must have if you visit Beerburg Brewing. The seasonal speciality was Atole Ice Cream and it was our favorite!"

                "description": "I came here on a Thursday evening, maybe around 7, and there were only a couple other groups there. We had the whole patio to ourselves with just our dog and the sunset! The setting is hard to beat, a nice view of the hills, an area with trees and benches, and a dog park. They have an indoor area, too!  The beer choices were plentiful and varied, and for non beer lovers they have other alcoholic and nonalcoholic options.  We ordered flautas, brisket tacos, and patatas bravas. My favorite of the three were the patatas - great flavor, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Also quite a bit for the price. The flautas were good - the shell was perfectly crunchy. But, the taste was lacking. This was the case with the tacos, too. Also, for the price, I think 3 would be more reasonable vs. 2... Though I was satisfied (not too full) by the end. Definitely order some ice cream! Both flavors we had were great - probably the best of the food tbh!  Overall a great place to hang out with some friends and have a few drinks. Very dog friendly. The food is promising, but will have to try more to be convinced."

The staff is friendly and takes their time explaining what's on the menu and even provides recommendations.  Their food is fresh and delicious ... every item we ordered was so tasty! I LOVE that they have homemade ice cream ... a variety of flavors and some of them that are seasonal. I'm definitely coming back to enjoy their outdoor seating,  try their other tacos and of course... ice cream!!!  Potatos bravas - nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Delicious seasoning. Great sauce to dip the potatoes in.  Guacamole - oh so fresh! Again, just the right amount of salt and lime in it. Chips were fresh too.  Brisket tacos - well marinated and cooked brisket (on the spicy side), with caramelized and pickled onions on a semi fried taco... yum yum yum  Ice cream - chocolate with strawberry was great although I did wish they had more strawberries in it. Blueberry cheesecake tasted just like it's name!  Beerburg Brewery for the win!!!"

It wasn't crowded which was nice because it was relaxing- although I'm sure that won't last long...  we tried the flight and a variety of beers and enjoyed all of it! The staff was super friendly and the place is spacious and clean.   We got the mushroom asada and the quesadillas and both were amazing. I loved the fried crispy tortillas that both came with. The plates are a little small for the price but I think it is well worth to try the food! We also got pistachio ice cream. I wanted to get a flight but we were already too full. I would definitely come back though to try more as they have some interesting flavors!!"

But, I first need to mention the amazing music we walked into on a recent, sunny Sunday afternoon.   Michael Samuels was performing on piano, guitar, harmonica and vocals: a true professional. He had two other musicians (bass and guitar) backing him up and the sound was full, refined, joyful, and with a deep groove.  I just felt motivated to give a shout out to some great Austin musicians. Hope to see Michael Samuels back at Beerburg!   Now onto the meal. One order of the Winter Squash Huaraches (the Daily Special) and one order of the Cauliflower Chorizo Tacos. Fabulous! You can really tell this is a scratch kitchen using real family recipes as a foundation. Their corn tortillas are made from fresh masa for each order: the way it ought to be.  My friends were doing the beer drinking and they thought highly of the selections offered. Sorry I can't provide more about the brews, I'm a non-drinker. Regardless, it's guaranteed I'll be back for the food and music!"

What an awesome accidental event to stumble upon, although I'm sure I would've had just as great of a time here were it just a regular weekend. Great beers, fun crowd, lively polka music, very cool artisan craft fair, and one heck of a time in a beautiful beer garden setting. Well worth the drive from Austin if you're visiting!"

Great atmosphere, great service and great beers and I'm not a beer drinker. There is something for everybody.  When you visit a place like this your faith and hope in our country will be restored. The news and maybe even your own neighborhood/community could be negative or living in fear of what's to come, get out.. turn off the tv, hang around your fellow Americans and breathe in some good ol Texas Hill Country air! Does a body good. If that doesn't make your mouth water then stay home...   Food Trucks! Live Music! Veteran owned! Dog friendly!  Face friendly! Goof folks! Oh and beer!  Cheers!!! Merica!!"

What an awesome event with vendors selling all kinds of things, food trucks providing some delicious victuals, the Reed Meisters playing some great Polka music, and 12 Fox serving up some incredible beer. Without a doubt...12 Fox brews up some incredible beers. I really loved the Negro Sombrero. One of the best and smoothest beers I've enjoyed in a very long time."

The idea that this was founded by veterans and gives back to veterans is amazing.  The beer itself, I was personally disappointed in. It was too \"heavy\", if that makes sense. We tried 3 and one I enjoyed but didn't love. It seemed like they were heavier/stronger than they should've been. Plus a lot of \"froo-froo\" drinks such as mead, etc. made up half their offerings. I get that you need some for people that don't like beer but they had too many."

They have many of their own beers on tap (featured beers change often) and they also feature other local beer, wine, cider and mead.  It's a family (and dog) friendly establishment featuring an awesome tactical playground!  They have food trucks, live music events, and seasonal family fun events.  We are happy to have them in our \"neck of the woods\".  The owners are kind and always welcoming! We hope they stay around for a long time to come!  They have over 80 picnic tables spaced outside across the property, so you can pick any table that fits your style!  Clean restrooms! Free to use water and ice machine!  Changing table!  Rona Rules! Great place to have an outside birthday party or celebration!  The list goes on and on!!!  At at time when our local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and many are threatened with permanent closure, we are happy to support local business!  12 Fox has gone above and beyond to give back to the community, help neighbors, and support other small businesses at a time in need."

Any of you who know me at all know my great penchant for craft beers, especially local, and I'm always up for a new brewery. So, turn left it was.  Parked in the large gravel lot. Walked up the trail to the building - HUGE kiddo playscape - I wanna slide! :) Very chill, nice place with a great patio and lots of other outdoor seating.   The proprietors/brewers are Army Combat Engineer veterans who learned about and found their love for beer while being stationed in Germany. Hence, they dozen lineup of Euro-styled offerings. They use single sourced malt and rainwater to create crisp, clean suds that aim to please. Of course there's hefe, pils, saison, dunkel...they also do a solid IPA.   Highly recommend! Really great folks, brewing their best, and serving one of the most outstanding charcuterie and cheese boards I've seen anywhere...no joke (and you might know that's also my \"thing\"). Go hang out in the Texas Hill Country, sip a cold one, get your snack on, and listen to live music on select nights. If a band isn't playing, some locals might start a impromptu jam session. What else could you ask for? Cheers!  Note: at time of last visit was informed they were going to have 2 food trucks on-site. Icing."

Instead we found a business observing no COVID safety precautions whatsoever other than a chalkboard a-frame asking patrons to stay 6 feet apart, a guideline which I seemed to be completely alone in observing. Not a single member of the staff was wearing a mask, nor were 95% of the clientele while ordering at the bar or moving around the establishment. No capacity controls were in place, and the place was generally indistinguishable from a pre-pandemic beer garden.   A ton of wasted potential here, it's a shame the business owners aren't interested in being responsible members of the community and taking basic safety precautions."

Don't think I could drink too much of it though because it is so sweet. There's a playground for kids so parents can hang out while their kids have some fun too, lots of times they have a live band or singer playing. There's easily accessible restrooms, and a food truck if you get a bit hungry. Overall wonderful spot that's out of the way and away from the craziness... Just go here!"

The beer was absolutely amazing.   The beer was absolutely incredible.  They seem to focus primarily on Belgian style beers, which is my absolute favorite, but they have some IPAs that will appeal to the hipsterist of hipsters as well.   We also tried the Cranberry Mead as well as their cider, which was crispy and dry that would appeal to any lager or Pilsner fan.   The outdoor area was expansive and, frankly, beautiful.   The staff were very friendly, accommodating, and genuinely excited to share their knowledge.  It was fun to get their perspective on what I should try.    One thing worth mentioning...that I have seen in comments:   The folks behind the bar don't wear masks.  The order process is 6 foot distances, so no big deal for me, but some may have a problem with this.  Although I feel we are being extremely careful with covid guidelines, for some reason, I felt perfectly safe here.  Overall, I was extremely impressed with the quality of the beer, the beauty of the grounds, and the charming staff. This place will be a regular haunt for us."

They're dog-friendly (with treats) and have both indoor/outdoor seating. They also had TV that was playing soccer, and strong wifi. I love that they have flight options 4 for $10, as well as pints. It wasn't busy when we stopped through on a Saturday afternoon. They don't have food here, but if you ask the taptender...he'll tell you what food options are nearby.  Service was kind and efficient. Their beers were across the board--good. My favorite was their Aine Hefe! It was floral and super crisp for the warm weather after a long hike. They seem to do a lot of English style ales, which aren't my favorite...but you can definitely find options that suit your taste buds. They also give free stickers upon request. BOOM!"

I was actually surprised to see them so decently priced this far out in the hill country.   They do provide half pours in their standard sized glasses, just make sure to ask for a half pour when you order. I was happy to see they allow food from the outside as well which makes staying easier as you can bring your snacks in haha.  Not on overly crazy amount of seating, but definitely enough for 5-6 medium/large parties. They also seemed to follow the trend of allowing owners to bring their dogs inside which is always cool and fun to see.  They also have merchandise for sale and their shirts are super sick...did I mention their logo absolutely rocks!?"

The staff is friendly, prices reasonable, though quite a few of their brews tend towards English styles.   On our visit, I had the Norwegian Juice, Bellibone and the Killiecrankie. Careful with that last one, it's delicious, but at 11.4% ABC, more than one can sneak up on you pretty quickly.   Acopon just had a really great vibe, and the fact that it's dog friendly is icing on the cake."

Located in Dripping Springs and in a small space felt right.  On the day we visited they had 4-5 beers on tap I believe.  I'm a larger guy, so a Bellibone was ordered up for me.  Suz got an English Bitter Gaspipes.  I enjoyed my larger, it was crisp and cool. This is a great nod to Emil Christian Hansen and the use of his Saccharomyces Pastorianus, which he first isolated in 1904.  A year before the greatest footy team in the world, Chelsea FC was started.  And he was also a Dane.  Suzie drank her Bitter and coo'ed.  We would of stayed longer, but staring a gigantic Manchester City flag was making me ill.  Just Kidding Dudes, I'm still ill after that 6 goal slacking you gave us this past February.  Drop in, grab a pint.  Bring the pup and stay awhile."

I walked in thinking the same but was quite surprised to be able to chill inside with my fur-bro. Made for a much better time in this \"hotter than average\" June we're having this year. I've been here a few times now, have never had a bad time here, and after my experience today I will continue to stop by when in Dripping Springs."

                "description": "Huge cheers! This was my first visit here and I was really blown away by the selection.  The Homunculus is a mild english ale that is so light but dense with flavor it could be dubbed king of session drinking. The Rowan was complex and well balanced, dank and rich while the Rat King DIPA may well  be the best one I have had in a very long time, where the malts are less weighty or chocolate but more supportive. Well done! Forget any reviews that call out IPA snobs, Stout heads or wherever you are from, there is something for every beer lover here."

                "description": "The owners of the Barber shop wanted to start brewing something different.  They wanted to focus on creating English ales fresh from the cask. Their goal is to have at least one ale available from a fresh cask each week.  Are English ales their sole focus?  Definitely not! There are a variety quality brew styles.  You will find them here.  Their specialty though will be ales.  Acopon is just a stones throw down the street from the Barber shop in downtown historic Dripping Springs. On the Sunday afternoon I ventured here, this was a quiet and sleepy part of town. The tasting room and production are located in the same small historic building. The tasting room is comfortable, and inviting.  It feels lived in, like a proper English drinking hole should.  A nice change from the hipster modern sleek brewery tasting rooms popping up all over Austin.  The staff member behind the bar was knowledgeable and friendly.  They also have canned mead, cider, and wine options for non beer drinkers.  Outside food is welcomed.  They have some tables available outside to sit at, and are dog friendly.  I enjoyed one of their flights.  All of the beers in my flight were well structured.  I liked some better than others.  The Rowan was a stand out for me.  Good solid beers."

                "description": "A short review: The beer was pretty good - but served in plastic cups (unforgivable) - the service was kind of slow. Good prices.  A longer review: We were there during the Songwriters' Festival so this may explain the plastic cups, even so, if you care about your beer you can't serve it in a plastic cup. It defeats the whole purpose. But, looking beyond that, the few beers we tried were good. I particularly liked the porter.  The service was slow with three people behind the bar but it seemed that only one person was really doing the work. (There was a younger lady behind the bar but as far as I could see all she did was stand there and scowl at people.) So, a mixed experience. We'll probably try it again (I suspect the beer really is good) when there isn't a festival going on, and hopefully have a drink in a real glass."

These folks specialize in British type beers, which I like, but also brew one of the best New England style IPAs I've ever had...but they don't bill it as such. Roomy enough, down home local feel.

They had a wonderful live duo-band outside, but so wished there were more seating to enjoy it.  My ONLY constructive feedback for the owners is to offer (more) simple snack options - and, most importantly, provide LEMONS!  I just love craft beer with lemons. They had zero, so I'll chalk it up to new beginnings!  Worth a stop to have a unique cold one!  (Next time, I'll bring my own Lemons - it helps amplify my enjoyment of the bitter beer and ale flavors!)"

The beer was to put it mildly scrumptious.  The Rat King Double IPA was one of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of drinking.  Beautifuly balanced, malty, and hoppy at the same time, perfect nose.  Just awesome all around.  The Hans Trapp Imperial Stout was a malt bomb of the first order.  Great Beers, Great People, Great Location.  Great Brewery.  Must Go to if you're in Central Texas ..."

The Kolsch was okay - a little flat and slightly bitter. None of us liked the Rye Wit - must be an acquired taste.   We likely would have stayed longer, but it was chilly and windy. We'll be back in fairer weather to try the pizza."

                "description": "Welcome Hitmaker to the South/West-ish Austin microbrew community!  I love that there's newcomers to the brew scene here in South Austin. I've had Hitmaker on my radar for a while. I came through with a good friend close to closing hours on a weekend. We were stoked to try their flights, which was great to get a taste of everything. Their menu is limited at the moment, since they're pretty new. I didn't feel any sort of type of way towards any beers in particular, but I do love that they had a Belgian called Accidental Trappist. Their rye wit I love too. They tried to have a little bit of variety in their menu which I appreciated.  The brewery also smells new too. I love it. It's like the smell of a baby or a puppy. Weird. So let's move on. They have board games for all, clean restrooms and TVs. The seating options are endless. You can go outside and play outdoor brewery games or sit indoors at the bar or in their many picnic tables. Parking is also super easy, and the taproom is easy to locate with their brightly-lit sign (especially at night). I definitely see us coming back here more often, especially since our taptender was a sweet and informative man who was so kind to stay a little past brew hours to let us finish our conversation and beers. I will definitely be back for the exceptionally kind service and cozy brew times."

                "description": "I live pretty far from Hitmaker but have tried to visit a couple of times when I happened to be in the area. I recall both times they were closed when I was near by. My plan was almost foiled again, but this time luck was on my side. Due to Covid-19 the hours online didn't match their actual hours so I got there an hour before they were actually set to open. I didn't want to wait around for an hour until opening time so I was going to head home. As I was leaving I happened to run into one of the workers (maybe an owner) and after explaining my dilemma he graciously agreed to let me in an hour early to enjoy their beer. I was delighted and thankful. I got a glass of the Summer Saison and the Hill Country Haze and enjoyed both. The service was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable."

                "description": "A friend recommended that we meet up at Hitmaker Brewpub. Hitmaker? The Google provided some excellent information: \"The co-owners started six of your favorite neighborhood bars/restaurants - MugShots, The Hideout Pub, Bender Bar and Grill, Pour House Pub, Violet Crown Social Club and Pour House Pints and Pies.\" Having been to a number of their locales I looked forward to having a few Hitmaker beers.  The bottom line their beers did not disappoint. My IPA was not excessively hoppy and had that typical fruity citrus flavor. Plus one stepped out of her comfort zone and went with their Kolsch offering. My tastebuds told me this was not a typical Kolch as it was pretty lite and could have masqueraded as a lite pale ale. A good summer beer.   The bartender on duty was very knowledgable and was eager to fully describe their offerings. The taproom is cozy, dimly lit, and cool. Perfect atmosphere for quaffing excellent brews on a hot summer day. Lastly, feel free to bring your mutts."

                "description": "Wow.  8 beers tried, and 8 beers worth trying again! The kolsch is such an easy drinker, light and refreshing!  Pale ryeder and rye wit have a bit more flavor but still an easy drinking wonderful drink!  It'd be hard to stick with just one here, but if I did; I'd probably go with French Saison, wonderful taste and a bit stronger than the others.  Coconut Porter isn't the best porter I've had, but if it's cold outside this would be my drink at the brewery. Hill country Haze is an IPA I could drink, but I'm not an IPA fan.  Accidental Trappist is good.  I can't put my finger on it... you just have to try it.   The brown ale is a little heavier than most and I'd be tempted to grab it instead of the Porter.  They have some cans of wine and a cider too.  $2 tastes 6oz.  $4/5 16oz pours."

After hitting a farmers market and a flea market we decided to take the route less traveled home by watching the compass and staying off the major arteries. This is where Lady Luck showed us a sign that I almost can never resist,\"Tasting Room Open\", like a mosquito to a bug zapper ,I'm in!!   I have to say I really dug this place for a few reasons beyond the fresh beer selection. First is general layout,not to big or to small,its just right. Second is decor,simple,industrial,clean. The focus here is on their craft brews not a bunch of goofy crap on the walls. Third is noise, this place was chill. I was actually able to converse with my bride without the aid of ASL!   On to their craftwork, after meeting the very friendly barkeep we decided I'm a picky bastard and he had me try a few samples, all were very good. Landing with the Kolsh really hit the spot!!

                "description": "I keep saying it but I love seeing evidence of it.   Nature is healing.  And the scene at Frontyard on a clear, cool and sunny Saturday, with kids merrily running around, strangers awkwardly--but eagerly--striking friendly conversations was exhibit A.  The beer was smooth, the service prompt and everyone, patrons, employees and wildlife in view, was in great spirit.   Call it nature, call it the environment they provide at Frontyard--the property is immaculate--but it all came together.  Oh, and that view..."

                "description": "Frontyard is actually located inside the 5 Soul Winery property.  The overall property is super kids friendly. They have a large artificial turf area, multiple corn hole areas, a few pickle ball courts( requires $ and reservations), a few slides, and another big field.  So yeah, it's kids friendly. Maybe too kid friendly:-)  The brewery itself has some really good and wide spectrum of beer choices. I've tried their Belgium and Amber both were great. I recall seeing IPAs, Porters, Lagers and others on the list.   Prices seem a bit on the pricey side but I cannot recall the exact price.    Regardless, it's a fun place and super family friendly. Great beer, great on property food trucks, and pretty good wine next door at 5 Souls."

                "description": "First time here with family for the Sunday gospel brunch.  Absolutely loved this place.  The music was awesome. The breakfast pizzas were very tasty.  The adults loved the salted caramel stout, the rye IPA, and the pino.  Kids loved the root beer.  All of that to say the food and drinks are really good, but pale in comparison of the staff's friendliness and the hill country ambience.  This fine establishment will become a regular place for us."

                "description": "We can here for the first time last night. Perfect 80 degree evening in the hill country. Gorgeous sunset. The beers were super refreshing. Had a flight to start and then a full beer of one of my faves from that flight. Greats stuff. We skipped the pizza from the food truck but they looked amazing. Instead we opted for some very good brats and hot dogs.   The place is adjacent to 5 Souls Wine, which sources their grapes from Paso Robles. A perfect option for the non beer drinker. The overall outdoor setup is nice with artificial turf, Adirondack chairs, tables etc. oh and pickle ball courts too.   And depending on your view, it is very family friendly so there are lots of kids. Wasn't that big of a deal, but some people will not care for it."

Sadly though I give only 3 stars and it is for the daycare center atmosphere.  Kids running unsupervised in all directions, parts of games being thrown everywhere, yep thought I needed to duck a few times.  I don't mind kids at places but the kids here outnumbered the adults and they weren't in just one area so there was no escaping them."

We will definitely be back! Depending on the style of brewery environment you prefer read my \"fine print\" below.   The fine print- when we went early on a Sunday it was quiet and heavenly. Within about 30min of arriving the place was taken over by parents and kids who were not supervising their kids. Ex. Kids throwing ladder balls into a nearby tree, tossing a football across an area for seating, and swinging the porch chairs into the buildings windows. It was chaos."

However, when I ordered a drink from the brewery, the cashier had already chosen the 20% tip before she turned the screen around to me.  Very presumptuous and offensive.  In addition, the food truck on site was terribly overpriced.  $15.75 for a cheeseburger the size of a slider."

                "description": "After visiting Frontyard Brewing this weekend, it has certainly taken the title of my favorite brewery in the Austin area (sorry, Meanwhile Brewery). The views are gorgeous and there is plenty of space for social distancing and for the kids to play. There is artificial turf so it's perfect for setting up a picnic area and not have to worry about bugs or dirt. Their seating areas are set up in a way that it doesn't matter where you seat, you can keep an eye on your kiddos while sipping of your drink of choice. I tried the Hazy IPA and my husband had more than a few Ambers. I also got a bottle of 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon from 5 Soul Wine Co next door. It was pretty good, but I did not particularly enjoy drinking wine from a plastic cup. The food truck has great quality food. The pretzel bites were the perfect combination of chewy and buttery and the beer cheese was tasty. The burger was perfection, but I did not care for the chips. My kids had the hot dog and grilled cheese and they devoured them faster than they eat most of their meals, so I assume they approve of this review. My only complaint is that I wish I lived closer so I could hang out here more often. Check it out... you won't regret it."

                "description": "Really...? Please stop selling food or sell to someone who cares about food. I dined there many of times and hoped that this place would get better. Tonight was one of the worst meals that ever had. I will never go there again and I will tell everyone to avoid this place. I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 15 years. Worked in catering, private dining clubs and restaurants of all types. Mainly upscale restaurants.  I'm CIA trained and even taught at a cooking school for a few years. This place is way over priced. Their alcohol mark up on beverages was ridiculous. $7 for a domestic beer that normally cost $8 for a six pack. Our food was destroyed by a fryer and cooked by someone who has a vendetta against chicken. I ordered chicken strips not blacked chicken. My kids wouldn't touch it, or the mixed matched French fries that were 3 shades of tan and brown. For those who don't know... they served  fries that were from different batches. French fries come out of the frier the same color. Unless you throw older french fries in with fresh ones, then those get double fried. My kids did not touch anything on their plate. The word yucky was used. My wife and I had a chicken sandwiches that were way over cooked \"blacked again\" and had absolutely no flavor. I ate half of my sandwich and threw it out. They over cooked everything. I felt disgusted after I ate. For the price of $15 a sandwich it better be a $15 dollar sandwich. It didn't even come with fries for that price. I could of got a sandwich fries and drink for less from a fast food joint. Honestly it would of been better than my meal tonight. Seriously stop serving food.  Don't blame covid, cause covid doesn't cook food. I worked in a restuarant and two of us would cook around 200 meals in 4 hours every night, 6 days a week. There is a gas station on RT12 that has better fried chicken than you. That guy cares. You obviously don't. I have eaten at Proof and Coopers multiple times over the years and it gets worse and worse. There was once a guy there with a beard doing BBQ. The food quality actually improved for a short time while he was there.    It took over 45 minutes to get our over cooked under seasoned food. There were less then 30 people in the joint. I could hear the people sitting next to us complain about the wait. What sucks is that, that place has so much potential, but it just fights to be mediocre. If this review sounds harsh, you go and dine there. Pay inflated prices for a deflated meal."

It's a nice place to kick back, even when busy the atmosphere was pretty relaxed.  For context, we came on a day they held an event with a pumpkin patch, face painting, petting zoo and magician so there were mainly families.   They have high chairs for the little ones, and pretty good food for the adults.   We tried the queso, a few beers, smoked turkey, turkey sandwich, Nashville tenders and the brownie. Decent meal but GET THE BROWNIE."

                "description": "We were at Proof and Cooper for dinner. Girl loves a good fried chicken so we had to check out a local restaurant serving it!    We chose to sit on the outdoor patio as it was a beautiful evening. They have outdoor lawn seating as well which is just gorgeous when the lights turn on and they have live music playing.   There was no wait when we got there. The host was very friendly and so was out server. Very prompt service and no waiting around. I had their quarter fried chicken which is a choice of leg + thigh or wing + breast with a homemade biscuit and honey. I also ordered a side of coleslaw. The chicken was fresh and tasty. They have a great ranch sauce that goes well with the chicken. The biscuit and honey tasted fresh and delicious as well. Coleslaw wasn't too great... I don't think I'll order that next time. We had also ordered fried pickles and deviled eggs as starters... both were well made. Our family enjoyed the starters. For dessert, we had the peach cobbler that was warm and served with a scoop of ice cream ... so yummmm! Great finishing touch!   We stayed a little longer after dinner to enjoy the live music and it was just a beautiful Texas summer evening.   The only reason I gave them a 4 star is that there's a bit of a fly problem that they need to figure out a way to get under control. I do want to mention that our server acknowledged the problem and apologized for it. Much appreciated."

                "description": "Only been here once so far, but am surprised at some of the low ratings. Came for relatively late dinner on a Sunday evening (note kitchen closes at 9pm on Sunday but I think 10pm on other nights...better double check though if you plan on coming late). We were more than happy with the beer selection. Lots of varieties, and many of which are local beers. We also had an attentive server.   Blue cheese burger was divine -- strong blue cheese, nice thick burger patty and was cooked to a perfect medium (just slightly pink on the inside). Fries were excellent - the thicker kind that is crisp on the outside but pillowy on the inside.  The Nashville Hot Fried Chicken sandwich was also very tasty. Not very hot though, which is just fine for me. I would rate the heat level as a mild (similar level to the spicy chicken at Chick-fil-A). Biiig thick chicken that cooked through without being dry. Where it was thicker, I could have used more sauce/seasoning because the flavors didn't quite penetrate all the way through.  Mac n cheese side was decent -- creamy white sauce but not too strong on any particular cheese.   The outdoor part is definitely more atmospheric than the indoor seating, so if the weather permits, sit outside (behind the building, not in front). That area is very pretty (see picture)! The parking lot extends around the side of the building; it's not only the few spaces you can see at the front of the building."

Our server, Brandy, was great and made sure we were all comfortable under the heaters on the back patio.  All the food and bbq options were great, plus good kids menu! On the way out the kids wanted cake pops and the kind owners gave them to our boys and wished us a Merry Christmas!  That's the type of place you go back to!"

We got seated immediately and that's the only thing that we got on time. It literally took 1 hr. for our meals to get there. We had beefs as an appetizer, and they were straight out from a can. We also had cheese and queso... but you know...you can't mess that up. The mashed potatoes were either over mixed or the got a bad and/ or old Idaho potatoe. Yukon Gold makes a great mashed potatoes...Just saying. Our hamburgers were way overcooked, and the fries  tasted like fish. Poor waitress was busy as she was working on 7 tables with parties of 5 and more. I would like to see this place with a menu that has better quality ingredients that compensate for the price."

Although sometimes a weekend evening is a little busy and things get crazy, all in all we love to come by for their burgers, their BBQ is out of this world, and they have a great selection of beers. On the weekend evenings in their backyard area they frequently have live / free entertainment. The last time we were there I entertained family from California where we had excellent BBQ and great music. The stars were out, candles on the tables, children playing in the grass and couples dancing. A magical time! Highly recommend it if you happen to be in the neighborhood!"

As for the biscuits, they where as hard as a rock. So disappointed!!!!  Now I realize that take out can be tricky but I was given a pick up time of 25-35 mins and when I arrived 35 mins later I waited ADDITIONALLY 45 mins for the disappointing meal?! I just can't explain what went wrong. I realize that staffing or computer's estimate time may be off but this was a total disaster!   I'd say Poor management!  This place was not overly busy and Management didn't address this wait up front!  However, thanks to some good conversation at the bar with a patron lessened the sting of waiting!  Unfortunately, I believe that restaurant's have times where they can be a little off but I am taking Proof and Cooper off of my \"give them another chance\" list!  Bye."

You can do a 4 beer tasting flight and they have around 12 or more on tap.  You can buy beer to go in cans or they have growlers available and some cute merchandise.   Be aware the v neck tee shirts they have right now are cut pretty tight/narrow.    They have a nice back patio where you can eat and drink and bring your canine friends and sometimes have local craft vendors back there as well.   I really like their Coffee Kolsch beer!   You definitely need to walk next door  and check out Revolution Distillery - simply fantastic gin and cocktails with a free tasting of a few of their spirits.  Can't buy bottles of hard alcohol on Sundays but they were still open today (Sunday) and they are happy to serve you delicious cocktails!"

Such is the case with Last Stand. It's a good brewery. It's got old school Hill Country funkiness, as evidenced by their chicken shit bingo games (every 3rd Sunday!)  For better or worse, it's also just down the road from the behemoth that is Jester King. Hell, there's a great distillery 10 feet away! Last Stand's brews are good; this visit I had the Citra Smash, Simcoe Pale Ale and the Fuzzelicious. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about Jester King with every sip."

Large beer garden with Chicken $**t bingo every 3rd Sunday of the month. That beer tho!  They focus more on the hoppy-side (love their CitraSmash); however, they also make great porters, stouts, and other seasonal brews including barley wine. A flight of 4 - 2oz pours will set you back 10$ if it's your first visit. Then, go for a full flight!  Light snacks available (pretzels, etc.) and food truck on-site at times.   Package available for sell and they also custom fill 16oz crowlers. Cans also available at ATX merchants (e.g., HEB).   Support local!   Family and Fido friendly. Cheers to the love of great beers!"

My 3/5 stars is due to the build your own pizza coming with cheese (which we don't and can't intake) so we spent $20 and weren't able to eat it. I'm hoping someone else ate it because it hurts my heart to think a cow gave her milk for nothing. We were told that we had to purchase another pizza. We decided it would be best to go elsewhere for food. My only advice is to inform the customer that the pizza comes with cheese automatically. We wouldn't have known otherwise.

                "description": "This was our second brewery on our beer tour, while in Austin. Small place, and not many beers on tap, but you can still find some good ones.  Their beers are listed on the wall on tap, and they also have them in the fridge if you want to take some bottles home.  They do flights, and of course that's what I did to be able to try more. The Coffee Porter was like drinking actual coffee.  Delicious!  I left this one for the end, after one sip since it ended up being my favorite. Imperial Oatmeal stout was just OK, in my opinion.  They also had it in Whisky Barrel Aged - same alcohol content but the barrel aged process always makes it taste stronger.  I wasn't loving these so didn't finish them.   Holiday Ale - was good, tasted just like it's name implies. The one that surprised me was the Smash Citra. I usually stay away from IPAs (too hoppy for me) but this was amazing!  I could have had a second one.  Service is hit or miss.  They were a bit slow preparing our flights.  One of the ladies was really nice and friendly, the other two people behind the counter, not so much.  You can enjoy your beers inside but the outside is really cute. Looks almost like a schoolyard with long wood tables, space to walk, and a cute colorful seating area near the exit.  Across from them there's Revolution (locally mad gin) and another brewery. So, this is a good place to \"park\" and enjoy a drinking day out with friends, without having to drive around for more.  3.5 stars"

                "description": "Came here after a stop at JK and this place was a pleasant little surprise!  Far less crowded than JK and the outdoor patio area was fantastic on a gorgeous spring day to just vegge out, hang w/friends, enjoy some brews, and play a mean game of cornhole!  Their beers were very hit or miss for me. I did the sampler and nothing really stood out, but none were undrinkable, just not really my style. If you like hoppy beers, then you will probably enjoy their selections more than I did. Their stout was ok, but in all fairness, probably not the best choice on a warm day as it was heavy.  I will say, what stole the show for me here was our little discovery of their Revolution Spirits barn. They were doing a free tasting of their gin and Cafecito coffee liqueur, both of which were absolutely awesome!  I really like the gin as the lavender in the batch we tasted was very prevalent. I am usually not a gin drinker, but the mix of this w/the hibiscus tea that they served was perfection! The Cafecito, however, was so mindblowingly good, I immediately dropped the $25 to purchase a bottle on-site! It is made w/Cuvee and packs a delightful, caffeinated, yet alcohol-y punch. I have paired it drizzled over some coconut, chocolate chip, almond vanilla ice cream, and it is what dreams are made of!  I probably would come back here in a few months to see if they have any different beers on their rotation and to restock on the spirits."

I will say that I need a session beer from them... something a little less on the alcohol would be good, but that's just my preference.  The location is just a few minutes down the street from Jester King (so if you're already out at JK, come give Last Stand a try!). They are located in a really cool business park. There's also a distillery a few doors down!  There is a couple of places to sit inside and a full outdoor area with seating (if you're allergic to hay, it might be an issue)."

As we circled back to Austin, the Mister decided he would confuse his brain after the lovely wine tastings with a beer. This was dessert, he explained.   However crazy this idea was, I am now a fan of hitting all these breweries five minutes before closing. We were the only customers and serendipitously met the owners and their beautiful white boxer! The guys enjoyed their Coffee Porter and Pale Ale and we were on our way home quickly."

The inside is rather small if the weather isn't good, you might want to come when you'd enjoy outside. It was easy to find in a business park area. Parking seemed limited . We brought our kids, it was an Overall good experience."

There are lots of shiny distractions on the menu, for sure, but there are some solid entries as well.   The food is nothing amazing. It's just ok. And wow what a wasteful process to give everyone a pizza box. I guess you are not offering the pan it was cooked on or some other dish you don't need to wash or dispose of, and I'm sure they are recyclable, but you just have one trash, so what's the point. Maybe you are saving water instead of trees.   The events are cool, fun stuff. And like I said, a great space for it.   The bartender/manager guy is very snooty, but I guess if he is that proud of the place, that's good for him. You just get the feeling he'd care less if you were there or not. I can pretty easily choose not to go just to not need to deal with that.   But, I'll be back."

You treat a customer with respect and gratitude, guess what they will be coming back.. think of all the repeat customers you losing out on, because of your rude staff...  Do appreciate small business, but if you dont even care about yours and really improving the overall customer experience, why should you...  Setting yourself up for disaster.   I would find replacement bartender with a positive attitude with a smile in their voice..  Whos there happy with their job, not watching the clock for 8hrs to go by..."

We've been wanting to stop in here for some time and I'm so glad we finally did! The beer is tasty, I only had a few sips since I'm driving but next time I'm pounding some brews! However the pizza!! Omg!! Now that was delicious! I ate half the pie to myself and sadly I feel I could have ate the whole thing haha the crust is chewy crispy, the sauce tastes freshly made, the cheese actually has that cheese flavor and not some pre shredded cheese bs! Oh and the pepperoni!! It was so flavorful!!  Now for the atmosphere! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces!! Everyone was so friendly!! I swear this is the first place in Texas that I felt truly welcomed!!"

They have indoor and outdoor seating, you just have to walk around the building. We chose to sit indoors and watch the football game, wasn't too long before our food was ready and it was bread-tastic!!!! There is so much flavor, I would definitely order again it...

Bartender said it would be 10 minutes.  Finally at 1:15 first batch.  It was only then was I told there was a \"wait list\" I had to sign.  Batches were so small only about 8 people could be served and it took over 20 minutes per batch.  FINALLY, at 2pm I got crayfish.  They had run out of sausage, no potatoes, 1 small piece of corn.  Watching the Laurel and Hardy show of the \"cooks\" was hilarious.  They had no idea what they were doing.  Between 4 years in NOLA and 25 years in TX, I've been at least 100 crayfish boils. WORST ONE EVER.  Based on how mishandled this \"event\" was, I would never return."

From the moment you walk in, it's clear this spot is beloved by the locals. The crowd was a solid mix of tourists, cowboys, retirees, and working stiffs.  The tap selection is small, but they go out of their way represent Texas brews, even hosting a tap from Acopon, which is literally about 20 ft away. It's dog friendly, with a patio and a small performing space for musicians. This place just oozes history, it's definitely worth a look if you find yourself in Dripping."

Super cool owner too who I obviously know because of my tenure in this town.   The Barber Shop is so cool in fact that my wife and I chose to renew our vows there for our 10 year anniversary. Complete with a hail storm, cake balls from nearby Well Yeah Cakes, and a Elvis impersonator in his second ever appearance.   Beer is always cold; wine list is tragically minimal to the regret of my wife (think tiny bottles like near the airport). Yet, it's charms outweigh it's negative aspects. Heard these days there is a sammich outlet on site for food instead of ordering from nearby Pizza Cave or the shi*ty fried chicken at the gas station.   Biggest note here: It's little Rooster's favorite bar :)"

Sat was their 6th anniversary so the shop was packed with live music out back and a special cask beer being offered.  I have been coming to the Barber Shop for years as a good friend of mine lives in the Springs and we always seem to default here. Take note this is a beer and wine bar only. Yes, they have soft drinks and water as well. This is a dive bar extraordinaire so there is no need to get all decked out to hang out. There are plenty of draft and bottle beers with all the usual craft suspects and always a few surprises as well. The venue is dog and kid friendly so don't step on Fido and keep your cussin to a minimum.  Friendly patrons, good service, and a great beer selection that's the trifecta. Stop by when you are in the area. Lastly don't be shamed by asking for a haircut...."

In the early, early, early, early days it was a gas station and my dad told me they'd stop here for gas when traveling cross country in the 50's. I love this place because it's got a great history, the building rocks (pun intended), and the beer selection should satisfy most any beer drinker; lots of variation. They also serve wine and some non-alcoholic drinks. Children are tolerated until 9 pm. There's an area out front to gather and stand, an inside area to order and sit down, and a backyard area -- some covered, some not -- with picnic tables and chairs. There's music on some nights, a great after-work vibe, and friendly atmosphere throughout. Easy Texan drinkin' and relaxin' all the way. Stop by if you're in the area."

Have a beer with friends (or soon to be friends) and enjoy the Texas casual ambiance. They also offer ciders and the wine selections, while not vast, are good quality choices for the major wine categories. The beer offerings are superb. I've been coming here since they opened (5 years ago?), remains one of my favorite bars."

I went in last night (Tuesday/Halloween)for the first time in a long time. The World Series was on and I decided to grab a beer and hopefully see the Astros win with other Texans but... they lost. The crowd was small and friendly but I did feel like a party crasher because they all knew each other and were passing the guitar around. I hope this place hasn't turned into a towny bar because it never was in the past.   I'm going to have to go again to make sure or at least that's my excuse to go get good and affordable craft beer."

Wonderful areas for kids to play and adults to chill. Lots of great beer options for everyone no matter what your taste is. I tried the Everything is Aussome - an Aussie sparkling ale. It tasted a lot like an IPA to me. I may have expected it to be a bit lighter in taste but still a great bold flavor. Great for groups, family picnics, or just a fun day out to relax. Definitely worth the stop in the area."

Stopped here on Friday night and caught the tail end of their acoustic live music set which they happen to do every Friday night. They stage by far is the best set up I've seen In the area under a natural oak tree with twinkling lights scattered above. Could easily see this place being a great wedding venue. They also had a nice little hiking trail where there's additional seating and a kids playground located further down. Now let's talk about the beer and the brewery. The brewery is huge and has a nice modern approach with a little Texas flare. As far as beers I ended up trying a flight and by far definitely grab a Barton creek gold on a hot summer day. If your looking more of a full bodied beer destination ipa would be my choice. Can't wait to come back here once the weather starts to cool down."

It has a great location right by Deep Eddys and Salt Lick BBQ, which allows you to make a nice day trip out of it.  Starting with the service, my party and I were seated immediately and were served. For drinks, we ordered  1. Adair 2. Zwickled  All the beers were excellent, especially the Adair.  For food, we ordered  1. Pretzel  2. Brisket Sandwich   The food was also great and a lot better tasting than other breweries, for sure. I did think it was interesting to have brisket pastrami cold, but it was still solid.   Overall, I will definitely come back to the spot because they have great food and even better beer."

They did a great job of enforcing masks when people aren't seated at their table and made it easy for us to keep distance while in line.   Their beer selection is very diverse, so I opted for a flight in my first round. I was pleasantly surprised they allowed you to include their more expensive barrel series in the flight which made the 4 4oz pours for $12 a great deal. While those were tasty my favorite was the dark Pilsner, for such a dark beer it had a more mellow, malty flavor than you would expect.   Food wise it was fairly typical brewery fare, but the $1 hunks of watermelon really hit the spot on a hot August evening.   If you're looking for a brewery a little outside of Austin to escape the city for an evening I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"

                "description": "Vista Brewing is one of the Breweries exempt from the new closed bar order (during Covid19) because of their food to alcohol  sales ratio.  We were excited to make a reservation for a special occasion and were assured (by way of Facebook messenger) that their \"kitchen was open and ready for business\".   We arrived, ready for some good beer and food.  First disappointment:  Their reservation check in system.  A chalkboard sign indicated a table for to-go order pick ups and simply an arrow for reservations.  No employee to greet, direct or be helpful.  2 employees filling to go orders as we stood in what we estimated to be the 'reservation' line.  Several people were behind us when 2 young women cut in front of us and said loudly \"Will you take walk ins\" and to our astonishment they got an employee's attention who completely ignored us and helped them get a table.   Very rude!  Once we were checked in we found a table in the shade and went to get our  beers and food.   Disappointment #2:   No food.  Only popcorn and a cheese plate.  That was it.  We told them we had been assured over messenger that their kitchen was open and they shrugged and said  \"Don't know what to tell you.  It's being renovated.\"     I can't understand how they are allowed to stay open with beer and POPCORN sales as food, under the Governor's new restriction.   At this point we already had our beer so we went back to the table to make the best of it.  Disappointment #3:   the amount of flies and mosquitoes. We go out to another \"farm style brewery\" frequently and have never had an issue with flies or mosquitoes like we did here.   Maybe it's one brewery using a spray service vs. not?  Maybe it's dog poop from being a dog friendly brewery (although, so is the other farm Brewery we go to...)  We had 4 mosquito bites while sitting there and this was at 5:00.  Flies were insane.  It was a disappointment all the way around as we had really been looking forward to several hours of relaxation, beer and food out under the trees.  Added on 7/11:  I have not changed a word of my original review, however I am adding a Star based upon the great communication I have had with one of the owners, Kent, who wrote to me after my original review.  He seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and responded in a very thorough manner."

COVID: Vista has a GREAT outdoor area with plenty of tables distanced from one another. The ordering process specifies 6 ft of distance in line. Hand sanitizer is everywhere. Beers are delivered in single use cups. They have also started their live music Fridays again where you can venmo the artist tips. Masks are required everywhere but at your table.  You can make a reservation on Open Table for their outdoor area. Currently, they are open until 8PM.  We brought our own chairs and a blanket to use as a tablecloth. We also brought our own glasses to pour the beers into. I love beer out of a glass so this was a need for me.   Overall: This brewery has a ton of good stuff going for it. It's a little out of the way for Austinites (40 minutes), so you've got to make a night out of it. We're generally bigger IPA fans, so there are a few breweries we would check out ahead of this one. BUT they still have a ton of great beers on tap, and it is so worth checking out."

Pre-covid their food was farm to table and delicious. We're anxiously awaiting the return on their standard food items. Definitely a great place to check out!"

I didn't realize the current menu is because of covid. The sandwiches were all cold. The pimento cheese dip was good but hard because it's also cold. Literally everything came out of the fridge as they handed it to us.   It was a terrible first impression. I understand it's covid, but I think they could've at least heated the sandwiches or tried to make some better food that can be packaged.   Great venue. Not sure I'll come back."

                "description": "Big fan of Vista. We didn't get to experience their food as they are doing snacks only for now. I recommend bringing food as the snacks aren't great, but I recognize they're doing their best given COVID.   The beer is pretty good though and they have a good variety with their more evergreen beers like kolsch, pilsners, steam beer, IPAs, etc. The other half of the beer selection are collaborations they'll do with a lot of ales and they have a saison on top as well.   You can't beat the environment either. You're in a beautiful forest with a ton of outdoor seating. Great for kids; there's a playground way in the back too. They'll bring in good live music on a few days. Looking forward to trying to food when things open back up."

Plenty of seating in and out.  lots of room for the kids to run about and having a great staff about was wonderful.   only ding was the coordination / distribution of food.  Basically they ran out for our guests, and well, there is nothing you can do about it.   Events are hard to plan for, especially with family and kids, so we will work with them next time to better handle the food service / serving.   The beer was good, the wine selection was pretty good.   What i liked the most was the atmosphere. on a cool evening, with the stars out, it was a great place to be to unwind and chill with friends / family.    Plenty of parking..   Finding the place...well, thats tricky.  See punch in the address in Google Maps, you will be ok, just know that when you get close, slow down, and know the entrance is on top of a hill ... so you can miss it if you are not paying attention.   will I go back: of course, and I would recommend you go and visit."

                "description": "The pop up location at Bee Cave Galleria refused service to me because I have a health condition that prevents me from wearing a mask. Congress passed Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 241). The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or health condition.   Violating my civil rights is illegal and immoral and no public business can make a rule that overrides states and federal law. Imagine if Vista Brewing company refused service to a black or gay persons. This is exactly the same situation and they deserve a lawsuit.   There is no law in Texas or the USA that enforces a mask wearing policy. None. Period. No law allows a business  to ignore The Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is federal civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination in numerous settings including: employment, education, voting, and public accommodations.  No law exists in Texas or USA that enforces mask wearing. No business may ignore SEC. 201. (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, and privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation.   Corporate lawyers of Starbucks, Whole Foods, HEB, Home Depot, Lowe's and others allow those of us who are medically exempt. They know the law and don't want to be sued for civil rights violations. I shop there all the time maskless and have no issues.   Places of public accommodation are forbidden to violate state and federal law. Not obeying the laws from ignorance or self righteousness doesn't change the law. Businesses can't make laws.   My suggestion is - get educated on your legal responsibilities if you own or run a business of public accommodation. Wanting to have your costumer's safety is admirable but when that crosses the line to breaking the law, that's a line nobody may cross."

                "description": "Tucked back in Hill Country Texas, Real Ale is like an oasis with beer flowing in a wine dominant river.   I've been a fan of their brew since stumbling upon in (sort of literally) while on a vacation to Austin. Unavailable in Louisiana, it was a refreshing change when I was really first getting to know all the various types of beer out there. Due to the generosity of a friend of ours, I get to have some every now and then when he travels here from Texas.  The brewery itself was a nice, functional building. A spacey bar and plenty of tables and games to enjoy in the cool AC, or you could hop outside on the patio and take in some hills and the occasional breeze. Picnic table outside and plenty of parking is available.   I tried one of their rotating IPAs on this visit, and it was a delicious and refreshingly smooth 6.something% tongue pleaser. It went down a little too smooth for the Texas heat, but who's complaining. On to one of my favorites, Axis, first time on draft. I was one happy girl.   Service was great, and I enjoyed watching the bartender interact with a first-timer. There were a lot of \"beer guy\" patrons, the type I love watching drink beer as they name off the flavors and the ages with a simple taste.   My hope is to make it back for the annual Real Ale Day in April when I can take in Texas *slightly* cooler, and enjoy being surrounded by beer guys, nerds, and geeks, tasting all the deliciousness.   Real Ale is definitely a place you should visit and give your taste buds a break from the grapes for a hoppy bit."

I understand they recently expanded and even though their tap/drinking room is on the intimate side there is plenty of deck/patio area to enjoy your brew or their craft gin and/or whiskey cocktails. Real Ale has plenty of acreage for when they have special events. I heard from a regular that their anniversary parties are a must attend event.  Next visit I'll be taste testing their whiskey but this was a beer kind of day. I came in heavy with their Commissar Russian Imperial Stout offering. With an ABV of 9.8%, it's truly a sipping beer that is full-bodied with a nice dry finish. Plus one opted for a true summer ale, their Rio Blanco pale ale which was surprisingly flavorful. My last beer was their Axis IPA. I favor west coast IPAs but I may have found my backup. It has a perfect balance of hops and citrus flavors. Man, I wish we had a DD so we could have quaffed a few more draft options.   The barkeeps are knowledgeable, friendly, and will pour you s hearty sample when requested. Be sure to check out their production area it is quite impressive."

                "description": "Out of all the breweries I have visited in South Texas, this one seems to have the largest brewing capacity (but is also the LOUDEST).  One thing I didn't realize is that they also distill their own gin and whiskey via the Real Spirits Distilling Co.  You can purchase the gin and whiskey here, or you can order a specially crafted house cocktail if you aren't into beer.  This place is clean, up to date, and has friendly bar staff.  BUT, it is loud AF, and PACKED.  I stood at the bar for my first beer, and although I wanted to try a second beer, I just couldn't get over the loudness, and the bar scene.  I'd pick a quiet spot at the bar and then other customers would swarm to my area to place their order or mill about and hang out within my personal bubble.  I just don't dig that if there's plenty of other open spaces at the bar.  So, I fled after finishing my first beer. There are a few outdoor covered seating areas if you want a more relaxed vibe, but it was HAWT!!!  Most of Real Ale's beers can be found in a lot of grocery stores and liquor stores around South Texas, and they have a good variety of beers for each palette, so I suggest skipping the drive out to this brewery and just getting your fix at a local store or pub.  Parking is in a gravel lot and can be confusing. There's a \"no entrance\" sign before you drive into the parking lot, but I think it's supposed to be facing the other side street coming into the lot. Looks like it might have been turned around.  There's a collection of pictures of the character \"Rerun\" from an old sitcom named \"What's Happening?\" behind the far left side of the bar.  Ask your server the story behind that."

                "description": "Extremely impressed and proud of Real Ale for their expansion and how far they have come. Visited on a Saturday, on our way back from Wimberely. I have not been to Real Ale for clost to 9 years, so this was pre - expansion. Crazy to see how far they've come, and now they even offer spirits!   The tasting room is upstairs, but does have an elevator for handicap accessibility, which I did not actually see, I just saw the sign. The tasting room has a nice long bar, lots of picnic tables and clean restrooms. It's also nice and cool in here on a hot summer day. There is 2 tables right outside the tasting room, which is covered. You  can also walk around outside on the second level and look into the brewery or go through double doors past the bar, and have a birds eye view of the brewery. There is also some old school arcade games, FREE, that you can play!   We were able to catch a few chairs at the bar, and enjoyed a few beers. There is also seating outside, downstairs, which is covered and allows smoking. There was a food truck, which we did not eat at. There is also corn hole set up outside, and plenty of board games in the tasting room.  It did get loud, after what felt like a tour bus came in, but they were in and out so quickly, it didn't deter us from wanting to stay.   Real Ale is about a 45 minute drive N 281 from SA.   I love their beers, except all the sours... what was going on with that? Sour IPA? Never heard of it.. but maybe it floats someone else's boat. They had at least 4 sours on tap. They do offer flights of 4 tasters, or you can purchase a pint. The beer is poured at the perfect temperature! They do not sell beer to go nor do they fill growlers. But they do sell bottles of their Real Spirits whiskey and gin, as well as make craft cocktails.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. For a Saturday afternoon, we didn't ever have to wait long for help, even with as busy as it was.  On Saturdays, at 1 pm and 3 pm they offer FREE brewery tours, and you can take a beer on this with you."

                "description": "Jumping back in time to before our stay in San Antonio, our stop by Real Ale Brewing (with the addition of Real Spirits Distilling Co!) in Blanco, TX was a very, very wise move.  The place closed at 6, and we got there just after 5.  Our time was short, but our visit was good.  The distillery folks had left for the day, so the beer heads couldn't answer all my whiskey questions, but they were still great to talk to.  Not only the bartender, but also the guys at the bar who'd gotten off shift and stuck around to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  The facility is tucked away off the main road, and rolling up to it is impressive.  It's BIG!  The bar area is up a flight of stairs, and it overlooks the bottling operation.  I knew Fireman's #4 was popular, but WOW!  They bottle a LOT of that stuff!  Major operation for sure.  Impressive sight, particularly for a craft brewery.  Keep in mind, Real Ale has been around just over 20 years.  They were one of the first big dogs in Texas craft brewing, and they started out much smaller than they are today.  This isn't a venture capitalist project - this is a success story built on grit and good beer.  I'll tell you what, though - as a whiskey and bourbon head, what really knocked my socks off was their new line of whiskey.  I expect little of new folks on the craft whiskey scene.  Many source product from Indiana or Kentucky, and it tends to taste the same - usually mediocre and sometimes downright bad.  Real Spirits Distilling Co was a passion project by the place's owner, Brad, and it tastes like a passion for greatness.  When you have all the stuff that goes into making whiskey already on hand to make beer, why not?  That would be one approach.  This takes it up a notch to, \"Oh, and it's awesome on our first try.\"  I was very, very impressed.  I can't speak to the mash bill because they don't disclose it, but I seem to taste a lot of barley.  Not surprising, considering they make beer here...  :)  They don't use any rye in their beers, so I'm guessing zero rye, and I'll bet wheat is the other main ingredient.  Not sure about corn... if there's any, I'd guess it's not a lot?  I can't taste it, whereas most bourbon has a notable corn component.  (Note that their whiskey is NOT labeled as a bourbon, although they do use new charred American oak barrels.)  I'd love to know their mash bill...  I'll have to see what I can find out...  You can only buy the whiskey on site, and - like at all distilleries - you can only buy 2 bottles per month.  (Stupid rule.  Stupid lawmakers.)  So, knowing I live about 4 hours from Blanco and don't frequent the town, I naturally had to buy 2 bottles.  To be clear, I'm talking about their \"normal\" whiskey.  The single barrel sold out in a matter of hours when it was released in late April, I understand.  My wife loved her hef, btw.  We'll be back for sure next time we're in the area!"

                "description": "We went to Real Ale on Saturday afternoon when we were in town to go camping. We happened to get there just a few minutes before one of their tours was starting, and quickly hopped on after chugging down our flight.   The tour is interesting, but was a bit drawn out in our opinion (we liked the one that we did at Shiner a couple years ago better). The guide was a woman (yay for women working in the beer industry!) and she was very sweet and accommodating.  The tap room is kind of smallish, but it has a nice intimate feel to it. Major props for having board games available for your patrons! We've always loved Real Ale beers and enjoyed almost all of the different brews we had on our two flights. Our favorite, if we're remembering correctly, was the gose. Service from the bar was efficient but not memorably friendly. We didn't love that they had a massive television in there, but we guess it's a draw for Texas football lovers.  There's a food truck outside that looked good, but we just opted for some pretzels to hold us over. Our toddler was pretty well-behaved the couple hours that we were there, which always makes the whole experience more pleasant. Overall, definitely a must (in addition to the Buggy Barn Museum across the street!!) if you're in Blanco."

                "description": "I visited the brewery for the 20th Anniversary party. While it was wet, it was a great time. There are a lot of grounds so there was plenty of space for everyone who showed up. There was plenty of parking and so much room for people with dogs and kids. There were food trucks, live bands and tons of beer- ALL made by Real Ale. I honestly thought they only made about 10 beers. The party had 35 different ones, and that wasn't even all of what they brew! It was very hard to decide which ones to try with the 4 beer tickets each person was allowed.  I definitely recommend visiting the brewery! I am not sure how many beers they offer on their regular weekend hours, but they are all excellent, so you can't go wrong!"

                "description": "So excited we got to visit a brewery on our way out to Fredericksburg! When pulling up, you aren't really sure about parking, but you can basically make your own spot and roll from there. There was a sign out front, but we weren't sure where the door was, so after walking around, we went upstairs into the tasting room.  When entering we were greeted by the bartender, who was helpful and educated us on a few of their beers. There was several other guest there, which is cool to see in the middle of a Friday.   I ordered a flight of IPA's- all pretty good flavor, a few were lighter than the others, but I would recommend the flight so you can sample several of their beers. Hubby snagged their Axis IPA and also a sample of their whiskey, which he enjoyed. We skipped tours, due to time. But their tasting room was roomy and had long tables which are good for groups and cool views of the property. I would recommend stopping here for some beers!"

                "description": "Couple of thoughts.   The tour waiting and drinking area is comfortable with games to play and overlooks the packaging line. That is a nice touch.   The place is under construction so the tour seemed a little disorganized. The tour guide was good but didnt provide another details about the brewing process, how one beer is made different from the next or why some beers are aged in barrels.   The biggest disappointment is that i have been waiting a year to get some of the Cease and Disefisus (however the hell you spell it).  They had it up next to tap but I wasnt going to wait unknown days.  But then they told me they cant sell it by the growler or anything else to go. You have to drink it there.  GRRRR.   The best beer they make and it looks like I wont be getting any more."

                "description": "Cool place out in the middle of no where in Blanco Texas. Took about an hour to get there from Medical Center. Brought the dogs they have fun meeting fellow beer and dog lovers. All beers are above average and venue has a pretty cool almost Northwest US Vibe.   Tried the Whiskey (they now make two) both only on sale at the brewstillery. Was average still a work in progress for them but cool they are branching out.   They need to put a few more Barrels and tables upstairs on the Patio so more people can sit up stairs.  There are tables below but under trees and not much of a view.  Plus a long walk back upstairs for a refill."

                "description": "Who doesn't like a nice cold beer on a hot Texas day? If you don't like beer, then try one of their cocktails. Everyone in your group will be happy. The best thing about this brewery is that it is so close to San Antonio that you can go for the day and try all their beers and their new spirits. The brewery has a tasting room and offers a tour. I would definitely go for the tour. They offer them at 1 and 3 PM. They also offer gin and whiskey tastings. The distillery is fairly new.  The atmosphere of the place is very laid-back. You can enjoy your beer or cocktail inside of their tasting room or outside in their covered patio. You can see the operation of the plant from the tasting room.  They have beers for every taste. We fell in love with Gose. From what I understand, this is a seasonal  beer.  Parking is abundant and staff is super nice. They are under construction for expansion, but don't let that deter you. Cheers!"

                "description": "Real Ale is my husband and my favorite beer to buy in the store. We always have Axis or the mix pack in our fridge. We had been wanting to go to the brewery for quite some time, but knew it would be at least an hours drive out there. Plans fell through for Labor Day weekend, so we decided to make a day of it on that Sunday. On the way out there, we realized that it was the first day that Texas was implementing grab and go from breweries. It was packed to say the least.  The actual location is kind of hidden off the road. There is a lot of gravel parking available. Since it was such a big day for breweries they made a big event out of it. There was a band outside and a local food truck. Again, with the festivities, there were a lot of things not available that day. We were unable to do a tour, those are only on weekdays. They were not doing flights. We were at the brewery about an hour and a half. We drove over an hour to get there and another hour home. Most of the time spent was waiting in line to get served. The prices were kind of steep and we were given less than a pint for more than pint pricing on many of the beers. To say we were disappointed was an understatement. I guess we might have had high hopes, but we have been to a ton of breweries and this was a huge let down. Just do yourself a favor and get the beers from the store."

                "description": "Honestly I really wanted to write a positive review but instead I got very sick off the food tonight and still suffering. When I return this time ithis time it's different I believe the managers are different and is now owned by someone elsomeone else. They know they no longer make the drumsticks like before now they have dried up, comma bad bad dark meat of low quality, comma instead of the succulent white meat of chicken they normally do cook. They served me a very old salad it was horrible I didn't even get to taste it the tomatoes were rotten and smell it was were rotten and smelled you could tell the salad's been in a refrigerator for a long time period period the hamburger was a $22 hamburger small I took a picture so everyone could see a $22 hamburger with little fries. I'm not a glutton I just don't understand why someone would raise a hamburger that high I know that meat cost a lot these days, but but if it is small let it be an amazing tasting hamburger and his hamburger instead of dried up. To my shock I wasn't planning to write a negative review until I got home with a bad sickness my stomach is still hurting I don't know if it's what I ate or the chicken tasted funky. I don't think I can return back to this restaurant ever again I find it to be shocking that these people were very nice to me this time around  and didn't understand Why I felt bad after 35 to 45 minutes still feeling bad is still feeling  bad stomach aches..Hope this helps everyone out there who understands that if you're gonna pay over $50 for a meal it better be a good one instead of a  stomach ache!! New ownership but not in a good way!"

Plus it was very nice and clean which is a plus.  We were greeted nicely and made to sit at their patio table in next few minutes. Our server was very good as the water came out fast and after placing drinks order it came out quick too.   For food we ordered brussel sprouts and fried cornbread as appetizers. Brussel sprouts were usual but corn break was too sweet than usual. Than we had aglio Olio pasta without chicken and it came out okay. Though I liked their chicken pesto club.   All in all, it's a nice place to have drinks with big outdoor patio, good service and decent food."

Despite placing our orders right away, we learned 30 mins in that there were still 10+ dinners ahead of us and it would be more time. Best thing of the night was the waitress offering to cancel our order and close out our tab with our drinks only.   Our previous visits were OK but never lived up to any of the reviews we've read."

                "description": "The overall quality of not only food but ingredients and recipes has declined drastically in recent months. The caesar salad dressing went from creamy and rich with anchovy, to a simple blend of olive oil and parmesan cheese. Brunch items consist primarily of store bought premade processed ingredients straight from HEB. Sitting outside long enough you will notice employees running back and forth with bags from the HEB next door as the restaurant runs short on supplies throughout the day. A simple stroll toward the bathroom provides a clear view of the pantry stocked primarily with Knorr mixes and highly processed precompiled ingredients. For example a $22 Eggs Benedict Entree consisted of store bought Thomas English Muffins, pre-packaged ice cold Parma Prosciutto, Ore-Ida frozen potato cubes, and \"hollandaise inspired\" Knorr Bearnaise sauce powdered mix (almost more powder than liquid sauce). The side of bacon I ordered was unmistakably signature Hormel fully cooked bacon drenched in liquid smoke and processed applewood flavoring. It is truly a disappointment to see a local staple that once emphasized farm to table ingredients transition to a business model that more closely resembles \"frozen food aisle to table.\""

The chicken was placed beside the greens. Probably slightly overpriced in comparison to other venues. The other food item, a chicken sandwich was good, although the choices in sandwiches was extremely limited. The bill was paid on the credit card reader with my tip of 20%. I asked for a printed receipt and saw that the 20% was calculated on the total bill which included the tax. I guess I was partially tipping the government. That practice is not acceptable nor is it standard. My suggestion would be that when you go, put in your tip manually."

We also got the charcuterie board and fried cornbread and really enjoyed those as well. I had the aglio olio for my main and it was tasty. The bread pudding for dessert was a great finish!

                "description": "We made a quick stop at this winery and enjoyed the view while having a glass of wine.  I chose a jammy Cabernet called Lone Star Cab that was perfect. They do wine tasting but I just opted for a glass of what I knew that I would enjoy.    The cafe was not open but they had items that paired well with wine.  I'm sure it is busy in the weekend.  The Cafe is small so get your food to go and enjoy one of the many cozy spots to view the vineyards.   The staff were very friendly and the store was very clean.  They have gifts as well.  If we were in town longer, We would have come back for lunch.    The road to the vineyard is gravel so drive slow.  Parking is free and plentiful.  Follow the signs as the vineyard is about a mile up from the main road."

                "description": "The wife and I tasted a flight of 6 wines: including the Rose, Cab, Red Blend, Merlot, Sangovese, and Syrah.  They were all simply awful swill. Everyone of the varietals lacked depth, character and complexity.  Everyone of the reds tasted blah, and I mean blah. They all lacked the distinctive aroma and notes that each of the grapes are known for.  The Rose  lacked any minerality that one would expect, and was as bad as the others.  The tasting room experience was as bad as the wines. The server had zero personality or character either.  We came away with the same thoughts as we have from other Hill Country Wineries.  They should not, nor should they be attempting to produce well known wines, and in fact do a terrible version of Cabs, Merlots, and Chards.  They should stick to Italian varietals, as well as a few others that might be better suited to the Texas climate, even though most people have no idea about those varietals. I suppose its just marketing to attract people in to the tasting room, and once they get toasted enough it no longer matters, since once the minds fogs, its just pour me another."

They are on a hill so that the outdoor seating has a great view.  We got 2 tastings and for the most part I enjoyed all of their wines. The Alamo Red was great and so was the Longhorn Red. My wife enjoyed the Chardonnay as well. The servers were very helpful and help guide us to their more popular wines.   We ended up buying a couple of bottles and really enjoyed the experience and the view. We plan on coming here again soon!"

The wine was fine but definitely not the sole reason to visit, so make sure you have a couple places you're bopping around to in the area. Cute little tasting glasses and there's a shop for kitschy items featuring a lot of wine puns.    I do think the crowd skews a bit older, so better suited for entertaining folks than a bach party!"

                "description": "Beautiful winery 25 minutes from Wimberly! We stopped by during 4th of July and was surprised there wasn't more of a crowd. Strict 21+ policy (many signs warning you to turn back if you aren't 21!) but the servers were so nice and kind. We did a wine tasting which was $20 for 6 samples of white, red, and sweet wine. You can also split the sampling between people, which I shared with a friend. Server (I think her name was Julie) was so sweet and knowledgeable about the wine flavors and gave us recommendations and some history of the flavors. Our favorite was the Starry Night, or the Orange Muscat wine! A bit disappointed they didn't give chocolates or nuts during a wine tasting and overall felt a bit rushed through the process as more people showed up, but it was still a unique experience.   The patio has a beautiful view of the orchard, which is why we came here versus other wineries in the area. Outdoor seating is plentiful, many round tables for larger groups too. Definitely would've spent a good half of day out here sipping wine if it wasn't for the rain. The Bistro (food/restaurant area) was closed because of Covid so eat before you arrive so you don't get hangry or wine drunk! ;)"

The ambiance is fantastic and is worth the visit to just get a bottle and enjoy the panoramic views.   Pro tip: they do not allow children, so know that before you go. I believe most of the poor reviews are about this fact, but if you are prepared beforehand it will help with the planning."

Bring a few friends and drink a bottle outside under the tree shade. They have a nice bistro menu to pair with your wine.   Prices are really reasonable $25-50 a bottle. Nice selection of whites, reds, sweets. Enjoy."

Prior to this place, everything I tasted was a mixture of sour fermented grapes. Not knocking Texas wines but they are just not my style. Maybe it needs an ice cube. Every wine here, ones that I tasted, is 100% Texan and done the way I think it is suppose to taste. Also, the view from the estate is beautiful. Very worth a stop for tasting and buying."

They wipe down tables in between people and staff are all wearing mask. Plenty of space outside for proper social distancing and enjoying some wine. We grabbed a bottle and ate at the small restaurant they have there. Would recommend you make reservations if you want a view. Service was great and food was amazing. My favorite was the pizza, don't remember the name of it but it had honey on it and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Never thought I would like a pizza with honey on it, now I can't wait to go back."

They have an outdoor sitting area where you can admire the views and the bottle that you order is brought to you by a server who wears a face shield and gloves.    My group ordered a bottle of the 2017 Newsom Cabernet Sauvignon and we were pleased with our choice. It was not dry like a Merlot but just right. This winery does not allow you to bring outside food only the food offered in their bistro outdoor facility. This was not an issue for us.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience."

We went an 75 minutes out of our way to stop in for a tasting to see what peaked our interest in their current offerings. We loved that they have so much beautiful outdoor space. That is something that was always a major draw for us at Driftwood.   We called ahead, let them know we had a pup with us, and wanted to do a tasting. They told us to come on in. (It was a Monday and the place was very slow)  Upon arrival they told us they will only to tastings inside? What? In the era of COVID? As for the dog, they said one of us could do a tasting.   Between the lack of customer service, unfriendly attitude, and most importantly lack of outdoor tastings we will never bother to come back. WAY too many options with just as beautiful of grounds, equally great wines, safe tasting environment, and more importantly good customer service."

                "description": "Good wine, good scenery, but the lady checking us in made it bad. First, I'm 21 and so is my best friend. We went with her parents, and her dad likes to joke around. We shared our ID's (after already confirming with someone else that we are at least 21 and allowed to enter), and he made a joke about us having fake ID's. Obviously we don't have fake ID's, this lady could've scanned them and checked. Anyways, she then proceeded to yell at all of us about how we can't allow anyone under 21 in the winery, she even yelled \"NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN HERE UNLESS THEY ARE TWENTY ONE, PERIOD,\" she really did say \"period\" which immediately made my friend and I annoyed. Just very mean and disrespectful. I understand that she was trying to enforce the rules but we are over 21 and she did not have to explain the rules in such a rude way. Even her coworkers seem to not like her that much, they gave her the side eye, like she's THAT lady at work.  Then we did the wine tasting and the lady who poured us our wine was absolutely lovely. So sweet, gentle, kind, and even in the wine tasting area we had a great view of the hills and nature around us. The wine was very good. we liked almost everything, and even bought a few bottles.  After this, we went to buy some bottles and a glass of wine, again meeting the lady from earlier. A hand washing towel that my friend bought wasn't scanning correctly snd she got VERY mad at my friend for it. She took out her frustration from the computer on my friend. She was basically yelling at her and telling her to get another hand towel of the same price, she was interrupting us, I was ready to snap at this lady. She was VERY rude the whole time. She got the entire room of customers quiet from her yelling at my friend. She was just clearly very frustrated but should not have taken it out on my friend, family and I. This winery is incredible, but her attitude, frustration, and behavior knocked my rating down from 5 to 3. I was gonna put a 2 because of her, but the winery was amazing, it deserved a 5, but this woman made a serene and calming experience a bad one. My friend and I are both 21 and it isn't our fault the computer messed up scanning a hand towel. There were a few more negative experiences we had with her but these were the worst ones. Even the other customers in the room who were complete strangers to us saw her being this rude, controlling, and mean and visibly for uncomfortable. This company would be a 5 star place without her ruining everyone's experiences.  EDIT: Her name is Aileen. I don't know how it's spelled but my friend that I mentioned remembered her name because we were planning to call the company and inform them about her rudeness to customers."

The woman on the phone said no reservations needed and the last tasting was at 5:30pm (winery closes at 6pm). We walked up to the check in host at 5:31pm for him to say in a smug tone, \"Oooh we just closed up\".  I told him what the lady on the phone said and he said, \"yeah sorry\". I was surprised at the lack of hospitality as we would have been out of their way by closing time and were looking forward to supporting a local winery during these difficult Covid times.  Better luck next time I suppose but left a less than wonderful taste in my mouth. I'll wash that taste down with wine from another winery!"

The views are breathtaking, and the main house is absolutely impressive, I was so impressed with the property I had to explore it further on my own.   They have been operating since 2004 and turned the former residence into a tasting, event and sales space. The sunroom and patio are perfect for enjoying a tasing or a bottle of wine among friends.   I actually sampled all of the wines on my visit to the vineyard, of course my preference is red, but I found many of the whites quite refreshing. Although the pool is no longer used for swimming, it makes an excellent backdrop, stop in and set a spell! Cheers!"

I'm not weeping with joy from any of the wines but they're easy enough to drink.  It's particularly lovely for violet crown sunsets, so save it for your last stop if you're making the rounds in this neck of the woods.  They don't have any ice, which I find supremely odd being that it's Texas and they serve white wine! If you want to keep your wine chilled while sitting outside (they've got plenty of gorgeous trees to provide shade but shade is not a wine bucket!) the only way to do so is to drink it real fast while thinking cold thoughts."

They have lovely picnic tables outside to bring your own snacks or enjoy their pizza or charcuterie boards alongside bought bottles. I just wish they had some music playing it was very quiet like pin drop quiet. I feel as though that might add a more comforting ambience. However we enjoy it very much and the restaurant near by looked spectacular"

                "description": "This is a must-stop on your wine tour and where we began ours! The architecture alone is a photographer's paradise and the wine is wonderful.   We were a little disappointed to hear that, as of our visit in May, they weren't doing tastings due to Covid because I do think it can be done safely and would've made for a better experience. Otherwise, you either have to buy a full bottle or multiple bottles if you'd like a well-rounded understanding of their wines. We opted for a blend that we absolutely loved, described on the bottle as a \"patchwork quilt of grapes.\" It was honestly worth every penny--so delicious!   We took our bottle and glasses outside onto the expansive lawn which is just perfect for picnics. They have lots of shaded tables under the old growth trees.   Perhaps for safer tastings they could serve them \"beer flight\" style with the informational flyer and direct you to sit outdoors so that you can still experience a handful of their wines without breaking the bank? That would make it a 5-star experience for me!"

I've done the tasting before and also just purchased wine by glass. Both are delightful. Tasting is nice for first timers to explore a variety of wines Duchman produces. Because of the tasting, I was able to find my favorite red and white wine of theirs. And for $10/tasting, it is such a steal!! (Price may have changed. This was based off of 2018). After my first visit, I just opt to get a bottle or glass of my favorite red and sip it on the patio taking in good wine, views, and company.   My friends and I always love to end our Hill Country winery trek at Duchman and drive over to Salt Lick after for good ol Texas BBQ."

                "description": "This was actually one of my favorite stops in our Driftwood wine tasting day. This particular winery has outdoor picnics for groups and benches for smaller groups for one to buy a bottle , bring some of your own food and enjoy their wines. During this pandemic time, this is the perfect scenario to drink wine while still practicing social distancing.   They do allow you to use the restroom with mask wearing enforced for you to go inside the building.   Their wine was light and refreshing. We chose  a white wine.   If you go near the end of the day you enjoy a nice sunset followed by lighted trees giving you a Christmas vibe. Up until that day , I never knew that Texas had a winery side like Driftwood but places like Duchman Family Winery proved to me that they do exist and they have really good wine too. Highly recommend you make a stop at this winery."

If it was a free tasting I wouldn't care as much . When I made reservation I was specific about food and was not given accurate info. You are not able to order food or eat during the tasting. Food only available to purchase after tasting was over. Servers poured wine on top of previous tasting . Missed poured twice . Server changed frequently and not consistent. They obviously are not organized to keep track of what wine we should be on . Huge red wine fan( live in Europe for 6 years ) was not a fan of  any of the reds . Surprisingly liked 2 of the whites, Beautiful atmosphere and building . A shame the tasting experience doesn't match . Could be so much better!!"

Dropped into this place for a quick wine tasting, consisting of 6 small pours of wine. The whites we tasted were all very smooth, not overly sweet but just the right amount of smooth and dry. Definitely recommend sampling all the whites if you have time, you won't be disappointed!  We didn't go check out Trattoria next door for food, but have been there in the past and pretty good Italian food, pairs well with the winery.  If you come here and the weather is looking good, you can expect a very scenic, picturesque spot to spend some time at!"

The only way I can imagine that someone would really enjoy it, is to bring your own picnic and use their outdoor seating area. This is of course conditioned on the weather and also whether or not there is gonna be any bachelorette party there during your visit. (We saw two when we visited and they were so loud and they had overtaken all the outdoor seatings)  We tried their tasting. It was only $15 which is relatively cheap. In Napa you pay 2-3x more than that in a good winery. They let you choose your own 5 wines out of their selection or go with their recommendation. The tasting overall was okay, nothing that I disliked and at the same time nothing wowed me. I'm not sure if I'm gonna go back there, but it was worth to try it once."

                "description": "Duchman is a great winery to visit near Austin that makes great wines.  I've recently been on a kick to learn more about and try Texas wines.  I've tried wine from several different Texas wineries in the past couple months (all purchased from wine stores) and Duchman is so far my favorite.  I prefer red wines and my favorite Duchman wines are the Aglianico and Sangiovese. Since the winery is so close to Austin, my husband and I decided to visit.  The grounds are beautiful - the perfect place for a picnic.  I appreciate the precautions they've taken due to COVID-19 too.  You can't go into the building (though they will let you in if you need to use the restroom), so they are set up outside selling wine by the bottle and require everyone to wear a mask.  There is plenty of space to picnic and social distance.  They sell some picnic meals on-site, but we brought pizza from Pieous, bought a bottle of wine, and had a lovely time relaxing at a picnic table in the shade.  I highly recommend visiting Duchman.  I'm happy there is a winery that makes great wines so close to Austin.  Even if you can't do a tasting during COVID-19, it is still worth the drive to drink wine in a pretty setting!"

                "description": "Really beautiful property. We wanted to go to Salt Lick and wanted to find some other activities in the area so came here for a tasting before lunch. They do $15 for 6, which is pretty good, and was offering 5% off your total bill for following them on Instagram.   There's some beautiful benches set up outside to go with your glass of wine. It unfortunately seemed to be drought season when we visited so the actual grape plants were pretty bare. Once you step inside, there's a small room where the tastings happen and the shop where they sell bottles and all kinds of souvenirs. There unfortunately wasn't any seating indoors so we had to stand the entire time. If you walk in more, you can see barrels and label making rooms. Wish they had given us more history during our tasting but it was fun nonetheless.   It was pretty easy to get an uber out here from the city but be warned getting an uber out here may take a little while."

The chicken Alfredo was excellent with lots of spices and flavors that you don't normally get with such a basic meal. The stake frites meal was incredible.  The sangria was good but the waitress said all they do is open the bottle and pour it in your cup so that just made it seem much more expensive than it should have been. It was nicely flavored.   The open seating to listen to live music was wonderful. Very comfortable with cornhole and Jenga games while you wait. There is a large pavilion and lots of open areas to hang out in. Great place to spend a lazy Saturday evening   Unfortunately, the spa is not open still which was disappointing.  The front desk said they're having a hard time finding employees for it.    We had room 1710 and it was very nice.  The only downside is that you have to walk down a rickety set of stairs and then through the mud to get to the room from the parking area.  The room itself was very nice and clean. The bed was comfortable and they did a great job of having the room stocked for us. Overall, a very nice place for the weekend"

Walked in at 2pm on a Saturday excited to order a glass of wine and enjoy a nice meal.  We were told they weren't seating.  Side note:  The place had a number of other tables with menus and staff taking orders.  They close at 2:30 for a mid-afternoon break(?).  Option provided by staff:  Go to the Smokehouse and sit on a bench and eat.  We were starving otherwise this option would not have been considered.    Ordered at Smokehouse and it was DISGUSTING.  If you are smoking beef in Texas it should be at minimum edible.  Ordered a brisket sandwich and bbq tacos.  Brisket sandwich was all fat and no meat with a disgustingly soggy bun.  Fat swimming in bbq sauce.  Absolutely revolting.  Tacos, same.  Fatty, drippy and translucent meat substance in a mini stale tortilla.    Definitely overpriced.  Fast food and gas stopover giant, Rudy's does such a better job!  Seriously, not worth the money for what was served: crap in a paper hotdog basket.    Onward to Hilmy Winery to pickup our quarterly wine allocation.  No need to let a dreadful lunch ruin our afternoon.  I really wished we had passed on this badly needed substance stop.  Hilmy flock allocations had a wonderful pairing!   So glad that we barely chocked down the Smokehouse offering.   The pairings were awesome.  We won't be back to Old 290.  Too many other great places in the Fredericksburg area.  Only good takeaway here was the bag of Miss Vickies potato chips."

For drinks, my husband had the pale ale, and I had the rose. Both excellent. For dinner, the kids had the pizza and chicken strips and my husband had the burger, while I had the Tri Tip Dip. The burger was cooked perfectly and the sandwich was a new twist on a classic that I order often when we dine out- this is the best I've ever had. To finish up, we ordered both the chocolate torte and pecan pie. The pie had orange zest in it...a surprising but delicious addition. The best part? The yard in the picture I'm attaching. The kids ran around while we enjoyed our beverages and enjoyed live music. The pricing was fair, service quick and luckily they were able to get us in because I made the reservation via open table for the wrong night (the hostess said it happens often so pay attention to the date when making yours!)"

                "description": "I had to give this place a single star, i am sorry but the five stars it has on yelp is very misleading, must have been artificially inflated by employees or family members or paid russian bots because the food was ok and the service was a complete catastrophe. I think it is unfair to others that trust and have confidence in yelp. I have had some amazing undeniably amazing meals in San Francisco, Chicago, Phoenix and Miami with the help of Yelp, i felt bamboozled sitting in the dining room of the Old 290 Brewery. I understand covid has taken its toll on the industry, take out tables reduce capacity if you dont have the kitchen staff to properly serve all the guests. Our server Josh was triple sat with our table being the fourth he did a great job of explaining his game plan and he waited on his section as it was one large table, i applaud his effort. All of his tables had issues and he was never going to catch up and there was no evidence of teamwork whatsoever. A vast amount of tables received their appetizers and entrees together and and salads and entrees at the same time. I assume the restaurant has a manager i think it was the woman dressed like she was going to the Kentucky Derby she spoke to a table and brought the table water but you could tell she didnt care she just wanted to talk to the regulars, she really enjoyed the sound of her voice we called her Julie from the love boat through out or meal. I understand restaurants like this only care about the regulars that like to name drop and ask if chef/owner/president  is in... that is why i made this review so not another traveler, vacationer, honeymooners, birthday revelers (us) dont fall for the inaccurately described and awarded restaurant. The food was decent the steak tasted great and was perfectly cooked Pittsburgh Rare but there is no way to absolve all the inequities the front of the house presented. Take this review with a grain of salt"

We didn't even know it existed until google directions told us as we were heading to a winery in Fredericksburg.  Staff was very friendly and efficient. Place is clean, esp the restroom. Food was good. We had iceberg wedge salad, flatbread, Cesar ssalad, tuna salad. Everything was great except tuna slices were from a bag.  Aside from the restaurant, there is a brewery and housing- resort type set up and venue for weddings. Will try again."

We tried several things but our favorite was the Angry birds (boneless wings) great flavor and amazing crunch on the breading. The ribs are also good and the tropical mimosa on the brunch menu. We also had the chicken sandwich and a pizza they were both good too. If you are staying at the resort make sure to grab dinner here at least once. The staff is very friendly and attentive."

Me and my husband each did a wine  flight and picked our favorite sips and ordered a glass each which we enjoyed on the fabulous patio.  I love that with every flight purchase included is a souvenir wine  glass. Flights and by the glass were very reasonable given the type of wine  served.  We ended up enjoying our time so much that we came back an additional day.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to sip on some delicious wine ."

However, do not fret if you didn't, because the grounds are stunning. You can order a glass or a bottle, no judgment ;), from their double decker bus, that gave me some serious harry potter vibes. Then take it and enjoy the view. There is ample sitting. I would love to come back with reservations of course, and try a flight in their beautiful tasting room."

Plenty of outdoor space to social distance along with animals to interact with: donkies, goats and miniature horses! A decent selection of wines with one standing out in particular to our taste-buds, can't remember the name specifically but it was red wine cherry blend, maybe seasonal?   The staff is friendly, place was very easy to find, there is a bit of construction going on in and around the place but it's not too big of an annoyance to take away from the overall great experience."

The tasting reservation process was pretty easy. The tasting price is very fair (5 glasses for $18) and the pours were generous. The wines were very good. I left with a couple of bottles. I definitely recommend the Christmas Cuveé and the Sangria wine. Once you finish your tasting, there is plenty of space outside on the patio or other areas to just sip more wine and just be.  A lovely experience."

I did like the outdoor patio and the arrangement of all the things. I enjoyed the red wines that they had. I really liked the season fruit wines--tasted like juice with how fruity they were (I mean that in a good way).   The food truck also served some pretty solid food. Really enjoyed the chili and cheese tator tots. The pizza was good too! The burger was a little disappointing though.   All in all, nice place to visit! Come check it out!"

We made a reservation for a tasting. Well worth it to learn about the types of wine. The staff is knowledgeable and nice. It is a comfortable environment and you can ask many questions.

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this winery. I loved it the first time and it left an impression on me to go back. Because of Covid, they are doing tastings by reservations only so that they can control number of people and properly space out in their tasting room. I'm sure you'll love a bottle to buy and you'll have ample time and space to enjoy it on their deck or yard after your tasting. Our tasting guide, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the different wines and a joy to converse with! They do have a good truck on their premises that bakes wood fire pizzas. I didn't try any this time because we already had brunch before coming. The port was my favorite wine. You've got to try it for yourself!"

While we were there we had a tasting.  They now have a full line up of \"fruit\" wines like Blackberry, Cherry and cinnamon, honey crisp apple, and others. They are on the sweeter side but for me were seriously tasty! I loved the cherry and the blackberry.  However at this time of year it is the mulled wine that truly wins the day for me! If you haven't had mulled wine I suggest you get off your butt, drive the distance, and sample some right now! It is so worth it!  A hearty and loud Ooooh my Goddie toooo Hottie to this wonderful glass of spiced wine that is served hot! It brings flashes of warm fire places, deep snow, thick sweaters and holiday cheer with every sip. It is my absolute favorite!  They are adding more structures to the location, the outside area is a divine place to grab a bottle and just sit and soak up the outdoors while enjoying a good sip with friends, and the inside is a great lush environment of comfy lodge like decor.  It is a great location with good people and a great selection of wines... not only theirs but a plethora of other wines as well. We always enjoy our time here!   One last note.... try the mulled wine! It is the holiday season in a bottle!"

They don't even use Texas grapes so these are all from out of state and only a handful are barrel aged. They were basic and not anything special. We came for a tasting so we tried a total of 5 different wines each (10 between the two of us.) They even serve store bought wines here!!! I've NEVER been to a winery that serves what I can buy myself at HEB. They didn't tell you anything about the wines other than \"this is dry and fruit forward,\" no explanation of the grapes used, how long its aged, etc that we've become used to at other wineries. Also the alcohol content must be very low in thier wines, we went on empty stomachs and neither of us felt a thing which is not the case at other wineries we've been to. I'd give it a try if you're in the area, but don't expect much. The grounds are nice and they have a cute double decker bus they converted but for us one visit was plenty."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in the experience of this place. We saw the reviews of this winery and thought it would be a fun part of our weekend trip, so my three friends and I came in for a wine tasting inside their bar and we were surprised about the snooty service and multiple issues we had. First off, when we were pointed to which bar we'd be tasting at, there was a dirty tissue on the ground that was at our station (which I had kicked away, not wanting to make a fuss out of it). It apparently wasn't cleaned yet before we arrived, so our sommelier wiped it down before placing the menus down. In addition, we were placed right by the exit/entrance door to their storage room where we constantly shuffled away to not block the staff coming in and out.   When she quickly put down some menus and expo markers and asked us to pick 5 wines to try and walked away, she didn't really care to pause and help us with decisions, so I stepped in to help my friends who were less knowledgeable about wines. Throughout our wine tasting process, our sommelier also made really strange comments to us, saying multiple times: \"This particular wine is really expensive, so that's why you only get a splash.\" Not sure why that was necessary to repeatedly state that? It wasn't encouraging us to purchase anything, especially when we weren't enjoying the particular tastes of our wine and she didn't bother helping us give recommendations, other than asking if we had any questions after we already picked our choices. When one of my friends asked about the bathrooms not working, she just curtly answered it was because the pressure gauge was off for the whole place due to the Wells. I understand that's not entirely in their control, but she did not have to respond in a rude way, and unfortunately my friends had to hold their bladders until we got back to our cabin bathroom.  Overall, I recommend people skip the wine tasting indoors and just go straight to the outdoor patios to check out the cute red bus that has the express wine bar service. The person in there seemed a lot nicer, and there were places we could've sat down and enjoyed the nice weather, instead of standing the whole time interacting with our rude sommelier indoors."

My niece and nephew love taking carrots for the horses and donkeys and kicking the soccer ball around. The venue is just beautiful and even when their are tons of people there it just doesn't feel crowded, the layout is perfect.    The wine is top notch. I  like sweeter wines so most on the menu suits me but they have some dry wine as well for folks who love a dry red or white.  Slushes in the summer, warm spiced wine in the winter, fruit wines in the fall ... this place has it figured out!  Grab a Cheese tray and hang out for an hour or stay all day!"

My parents were staying at the cabins at onion creek right behind this place and when we stopped I saw a dog inside so I called my parents and said meet us up here and told my husband whoa we gotta pet that dog!  I enjoyed the bead as I had never had it before and loved the inside decor and how the place is set up.  Cozy if you want it, outside on the patio ( not for us since it was raining) up at the bar or in large tables.  If you're in the area its definitely a must."

Beer, wine and mead only in a warm industrial space. The service was very accommodating, however not as knowledgeable as I had hoped, given the selection and the many questions several of us had as we tried mead for the first time. Prices seem to be a bit high considering we aren't in downtown, but it's a place we'll visit again."

                "description": "Hill Country Tasting Room is a wonderful find - I strongly recommend it! We rented out the entire venue for our rehearsal dinner, and it was absolutely perfect. We had ~50 people with an outside catered buffet dinner, and the venue was the perfect size - it still felt intimate during the speeches, but there was enough room for everyone to sit, eat, and mingle. The layout worked really well for us - for dinner, people could sit and eat on both the ground floor and mezzanine, and for speeches people mingled on the ground floor while the speeches were held on the landing. We love the atmosphere there - a combination of industrial, rustic, and chic that totally matched the vibe we were going for!  Planning was a breeze too - first Lindsey and then Deepa were both so accommodating and answered all our questions. Especially compared to some of the other venues I was talking to, Hill Country Tasting Room responded so quickly, kindly, and didn't mind when I asked a bunch of questions! I would definitely recommend them for hosting an event.  The drinks themselves were also amazing. We loved that it was all Texas beverages, and there were so many options! We were so glad to find a place that offered such a wide variety.  On the actual night of the rehearsal dinner, the bartenders were so helpful - I even got comments back from a couple of guests stating how nice they were! I can't wait until our next visit to the Dripping Springs area - we are definitely going back!"

The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the selections they were carrying and they were able to make great recommendations based on our tastes. They have reasonable prices, they were in line with the other tasting rooms we had visited during the day. Their concept was awesome! Their selection is from local craft breweries and wineries and rotates between different companies. They also had the beverages available to take home if you found one, or more, you enjoyed."

                "description": "Two friends and I went to Driftwood Tasting Room and asked to do a wine tasting. The only employee there, Antonio, said the tasting would be $8 for four tastings. The menu had a long list of beer, mead, and cider as well as wine. We asked if we could mix and match the tastings between these drinks, and the employee said yes. We then asked, several times, if this would still be $8 for the tasting. He again said yes. When we went to pay, we discovered that our bill came out to more than twice that amount. Apparently, the tasting was not $8. He told my friends that we received full pours, and that's why it was more. Here's the thing, WE DIDNT ASK FOR FULL POURS; we asked for a tasting. The employee took it upon himself to give us the full pours, which we did not ask for and shouldn't have had to pay for. We left upset and confused as to what happened. One of my friends went back into the establishment to discuss a refund. We didn't want to all three go in and cause a scene, since the man was kind to us, we just wanted to remedy the situation. Apparently, he reexplained the full pours THAT WE DIDNT ASK FOR and then offered my friend $10 out of his pocket. She felt guilty about this and didn't ask for compensation for the other two of us that did a tasting. I repeat, tasting and not full pour. I'm not sure why he would offer us his own money instead of trying to correct the problem initially. Maybe he knew he was wrong? Or maybe he just wanted us to go away and not complain? I really don't know why he would do that. We discussed it more and felt upset about the whole situation and how it was awkwardly handled. It was a damper on what was supposed to be a nice day out. I decided to contact management through the Driftwood Tasting Room's Facebook page the next day to see if we could be fully refunded for the employee's mistake. I explained everything to the manager, Lindsey Pierce, who, of course defended the employee. I understand this, and I have nothing against the employee, but a mistake was made and I wanted it corrected. I didn't mention the $10, since it went to my friend who spoke to the employee. Apparently, this gave the manager reason to believe that I was lying. She said that my friends could contact her for a refund and I could get one after I returned the $10 cash, which I didn't even get, but ok. I mentioned how she was treating me like I was lying and like I was a criminal for complaining about what happened. Lindsey Pierce then THREATENED to take me to SMALL CLAIMS COURT for SLANDER for writing this negative review. All I tried to do was express my dissatisfaction and try to get a refund, and the manager treated me so impolitely and with such disrespect. I would never want to go to a place where the management treats a customer so rudely. There are better places down the road where the servers charge you what you expect to be charged and the managers are polite and genuinely care about your experience at the winery. I'd avoid this place at all costs simply because of how the management treated me when I tried to explain what happened."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem and definitely a much needed place for the growing area. It has huge potential and I hope they get enough business to stay in business! I live nearby and it's a nice place to grab a drink. Beautiful interior! The glasses of wine were a little pricey compared to the nearby vineyards but everything else seemed reasonable. The guy serving my friend and I was super friendly and helpful I hope they continue to have great service. The only things I would recommend would be to maybe add a couple TVs without sound on to keep some of the guys happy should there be UT games or golf on. The bar is a beautiful spot to hang out. I'd also recommend having some nice big glass jars with some pub mix or nuts in that folks could purchase by the scoop and maybe even a cheese/meat plate or some olives. It's a great hidden gem for us who live nearby to be able to have an upscale bar with great local beer and wines. And sometimes someone in a group doesn't want wine so it's nice to have the options! Something for everyone. Hopefully eventually a food truck or some dinner pairing event would be fun. I have seen some really cool events advertised on fb but haven't had a Chance to make it in to one yet. I will add as I have two kids I wouldn't recommend this a place for kids as there isn't really an outdoor space. A great date spot or place to meet friends for a small birthday. Bonus would be to add a happy hour or special pricing for driftwood locals!!"

                "description": "I had a lovely few nights stay at Lucky Arrow. We traveled with friends - 3 other couples and their kids - and stayed in a cluster of four cabins. It was the perfect pandemic vacation: we were able to socialize with our friends and still have our own spaces, without being indoors together. I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much with strangers staying in the cabin cluster with me, especially since each pair of cabins shares a hot tub (which was delightful to relax in!) and all four cabins share a fire pit.  The rooms were clean and modern looking, the beds comfortable, and the air conditioning great. They have basic toiletries and good towels. There's very weak and unreliable wifi at the cabins; I recommend you come here to disconnect. I had good cell phone service with Verizon. The cabins have mini fridges but no kitchens; if you want to cook, you'll have to grill outside. Bring your own charcoal and lighter fluid!  For shared amenities, there's a lovely outdoor pool, and a big space with a large fire pit, grills, and picnic area with tables and swings (and some covered seating if you need shade). The pool has a 1-foot area with lounge seats, and lots of nice floats. We visited during the week, and it wasn't very busy; our group spent a lot of time at the pool and were often there by ourselves. There's a small walking trail, too.  It is quite pricey; I don't normally spend this much on a hotel. I'm not sure if I'd stay again if I weren't going on a group trip (with pandemic friendly housing.) If you're going with a group, call and see if they'll give you group pricing.  Warning for those who are planning to spend most of their time in Dripping Springs drinking: if you visit on a Monday - Tuesday, as I did, most of the wineries and breweries (including Bell Springs, which is attached to the resort) are closed."

Wife was and is still pretty traumatized.  Took us forever to find management to let them know we are out and they told us they would pay for our room at the holiday inn. They did not.  Recommendation to LAR:  If you are going to run a wedding at your retreat, maybe consider additional help managing the facility. Only having 1 worker who is trying to run a wedding at your grounds isn't going to cut it.  * to managements response:  You want me to call you again? I'm sorry, but your response to my review makes it sound like this is the first you have heard about this incident. Is this correct? If so, this is disappointing because that tells me you have not taken steps forward to improve."

                "description": "Came here for a mid-week staycation. We had the place almost all to ourselves since it was mid-week in September. The weather was amazing! We rented one of the breezeway cabins with views+hot tub+fire pit. There was firewood at the cabin when we checked in. We had a fire and hung out in the hot tub to look at the night sky both nights. It was so quiet and relaxing, exactly what we were looking for. The breezeway cabins are beautiful and fun! The pillows, sheets, and bedding were comfy. The breezeway two-seater swing was cute to sit in while sipping coffee. It would be nice if the room with the couch and wet bar also had soap and a couple dish towels by the sink."

                "description": "Lovely glamping space close to the Hill Country and within an hour of Austin, but ludicrous pricing policies will prevent a repeat visit. This spartan campsite with tiny houses and yurts (with a bathroom space shared with pool guests) offers a close to the city getaway with minimal amenities. But with a per pet fee of $150 PER ANIMAL plus a nightly fee, they don't seem to understand how out of touch they are with pricing policies of similar establishments. With two dogs under 20lbs, you're looking at $350 just in pet fees prior to any rental rates for just two nights, and therefore Lucky Arrow won't be getting any repeat visits from us."

                "description": "I just stayed for an incredible weekend at Lucky Arrow.  Not only was the resort gorgeous, it was super clean and the staff was incredibly friendly.  This was the perfect place to unwind and still feel safe during all this Covid madness.  The check in process was all online, so we didn't have to worry about social distancing.    The rooms were so adorable and you could tell they really put time into every single detail to make sure you have an amazing experience.  We were able to sit around the fire pit, have smores and enjoy the quiet starry night with no city noise or much light pollution.    The location was beyond perfect.  It's just far enough away from town that you feel like you are truly on vacation, but there was still an HEB and tons of food options within a few minutes drive.  The gated access to the winery next door was a wonderful perk.  Highly highly recommend staying here!"

                "description": "There are few things more excellent than Texas Spring, and we were delighted to spend a weekend of the best time of year out in the hill country at Lucky Arrow during their opening weekend.  There is a central event space and bar / pool area at the top of the hill with yurts as well as more conventional accommodation tucked into the trees below. We stayed in a 'courtyard cabin' one of four arranged around a fire pit with a hot tub. Which was bright and airy with the squishiest mattress, soft sheets and plenty of space to set up our travel crib for our three month old son (they also have them there if you're coming from further afield and need to borrow one)  We spent the weekend listening to live music and sipping cocktails by the pool, wandering the shady trails, admiring the view and toasting s'mores on the fire pit.   Close enough to Dripping Springs if you want supper /HEB - but far enough out that the stars are super bright and the night is gloriously quiet. They're well-behaved dog friendly, so we'll be back with our (only moderately well behaved) hound. And for a yurt, I only peeked my head inside one but I'm desperate to stay in one soon!"

There are no TVs which is perfect for a weekend getaway from the world.   The check in and out process is nice, you're provided with a code to a lockbox so there is no need to wait for someone!   There is a communal area with darts, Jenga, connect four, and more by the pool and firepit area. The staff left out snacks, drinks and smore's fixings for us!

Only complaints were that there was no map provided, nor customer service available, so we had to drive around and try to find outlet yurt at 10pm. Which was fine - we found it fairly quickly. Other complaint is that it looks like the person cleaning might of got distracted and left the room, without putting the ac back together or bringing her cleaning towel. Also not a huge issue. Will definitely be back!"

As for the staff, a big thanks to Mike, Michelle and Zach! They were all amazingly friendly, kind, funny, and helpful. Your hospitality was greatly appreciated.

We were able to have our team join us here (from Austin) to prepare for fall + 2020 goals.  It was the perfect mixture of pleasure and work-- we were close to wonderful Dripping Springs restaurants, wineries and distilleries.  We stayed at the Ranch House were we could spread out and work on our planning during the day and hit up the pool for a quick break. And,  you will definitely want to hit up the s'mores/fire pits because-- yum!  In the morning, we had wonderful walks on the property and even did a mediation session out on the outlook during sunrise.  Incredible.  It would be the perfect place for a wedding ceremony!  I highly recommend a trip out here- I definitely want to come back for a weekend getaway in the yurts or cabins... they are so cute!  Oh and take a dip in the hot tubs!  All in all a definite 5 out of 5-- we will definitely be back!  A huge thank you to Michele, Eva and team for their wonderful service!"

                "description": "As good as it gets!! I have always loved their farmhouse ales (Ona is probably my favorite dark saison in existence but I'm also so happy about their lager program starting up.   It's great to have refreshing approachable pilsners for people that aren't quite ready to walk on the (beer) wild side. If you're ready to go a little wild I definitely suggest their cave aged beer (the premiere has a little funkyness but it's not too crazy, like overripefruit and sourdough bread) we loved it and it feels really fun to pop a cork out in the texas sunshine.   You can always count on Roughhouse to make something creative and unique and if you come to the taps with an open mind you definitely won't be disappointed. They have beers to go in bottles and cans too which is lucky bc some of the high abv ones are really the best (but I can't have them before driving, ha!!)   Great food for snacking, we got a bbq sandwich and really liked the bbq sauce, we ended up getting extra so we could dip our chips in it lol  The setting is hard to beat, plenty of shade outside with abundant picnic tables, plus there is an air conditioned loft if you just can't handle the heat!"

I love the shaded outdoor picnic tables, and there is even a fire pit for s'mores ($3 to buy the kit)! The beer is delicious and fresh and they have a menu of farm to table foods. My husband and I tried the salsa (made from the goodies in their on-site garden) and it is the best I've had with the right amount of heat. We were able to buy a quart of it to take home- yummy!  This is definitely a great place to hangout with the pups and to get some fresh, countryside air while enjoying an acoustic band and some fresh beer served by the friendliest people."

Admittedly, my hop-soaked beer taste buds may not be par with a more astute beer connoisseur, but bad beer is bad beer. Tis a shame: this place is a true retreat. The Austin-indie-jazz duo provided an eclectic sound which paired perfectly with this serene outdoor haven.   Their flight card/cart is cool...it's dog friendly....there's a cactus.  The point is, what can you do when the beer's bad but move on and find another place.   I'm also slightly irked when businesses refuse legal tender."

                "description": "A group of us drove in to get some beers on a hot early evening/late afternoon after shopping at San Marcos Outlets. And if you're debating whether or not to make that drive--do it. You're welcome.  Roughhouse has THE space, service-oriented people backing it up AND...(the most important part for all of us beer nerds) a delicious lineup of their own beers. We drove in and were surprised to find that it was tucked in at the end of this residential street. There is plenty of space here though--it gave us Jester King and TX Keeper Cider vibes with the \"outback\" far out drive that make you feel like you've escaped the busy city/town life. Parking is abundant in the gravel area, and from the moment you arrive you know it's going to be a wholesome good time.  We could hear the live band out there that day, and we saw people with their dogs and kids. So awesome when breweries allow all people and furry friends! There's a kitsch pickup truck out front and a huge wooden cottage-like space that is the microbrewery. The interior feels much more quaint and modern, so get out your hipster glasses and handkerchiefs, millenials! I enjoyed my flight of beers for $12. My favorite beers were Treeform IPA and Floral Print. I ended up taking a Treeform home, and the label is so tastefully done with an earthy and spritely flavor.   We also ordered burgers (that come with mac and cheese! SO ooey gooey), and I gotta say their black bean veggie burger was not bad. I'm critical of veggie burgers because most people just slap it on the grill and that's it...or they just give you a thick piece of Portobello between two slices of bread. Not at Roughhouse! We also enjoyed a game of cornhole and can confirm they also have large Jenga. They have clean restrooms and serve-yourself water. Wifi is strong and it's a guaranteed a good time. Will definitely be back. Can't wait to see them grow and expand in the community."

                "description": "Roughhouse Brewing is the cutest husband and wife brewing company in Texas!   If you're in the San Marcos area, this is a great place to spend the day drinking some delicious farm-style beer, wine and ciders in an absolutely gorgeous wooden barn.   The building alone is worth the drive, but the Treeform IPA is what kept me smiling ear to ear! One of the best IPAs I've ever had.   Our Saturday trip included some really nice tunes by a local acoustic guitar player on the stage in the backyard. We had a very large group in town for a funeral, and there was plenty of seating outside for us all and the staff was incredibly accommodating, offering everyone samples since we were all first timers.   We don't make it out to San Marcos often, but this will definitely be a place we visit every chance we can. Great job! We wish you nothing but the best!!"

                "description": "We had rented a little house at the Lighthouse Hill Ranch which is part of the property so decided to check out the Arc near sunset.   The building itself IMHO is an odd shape but the views are amazing. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. We took the elevator to the roof and we're not disappointed. The views on both sides were spectacular.   We went back down and grabbed a glass of wine and found a nice quiet spot on the bottom floor overlooking the ranch property and the pool area. (See pics)  My friend loved her wine so much she grabbed a bottle on the way out. I can't remember the name but I do know it was a white wine and it was from Slovakia. Who knew right?    Next time you are on 281 and you see the oddly shaped building on the hill, go grab a glass or a bottle and enjoy the view!"

Even though this is out near the Texas Wine Country, they carry non-Texas wine, beer and bubbles.   Their are two patio areas- one on the first level and one a few floors up on the roof. In between the first and top floors are small rooms you can rent. The pool access is a perk for staying there."

Most of the time, spontaneous stops are the best, and this was no exception. The views really are fabulous and there is plenty of lovely seating outside to see all around in every direction. They have a great selection of different wines as well as cute cheese/meat platters to snack on. It's a fun and different stop to make while you're on a wine trip."

                "description": "I'm definitely not a wine guy, but this is still an awesome place to visit. The views of the Texas hill country are amazing!  The place is perched on top of a hill, so even the terrace on the ground floor has amazing views.  After you order your wine, head on up to the fourth-floor terrace for even more astounding views of this beautiful ranch.  As someone else pointed out, it's a wine bar; they do not make their own wine here.  But don't let that stop you from paying them a visit. I counted 29 varieties of wine on their list.  Choices from Argentina, Spain, California, Sicily, France, South Africa, Oregon, and of course, good ol' Texas wine (and many more states and countries that I haven't listed).  You can order a glass of wine, a full bottle of wine, or do what I did. You can go for the \"Wine Tasting\" for $14.95.  You get your choice of five different wines (one-ounce pours).  I'm new to the wine scene, so I was expecting to pick all five choices up front and have them served like a beer flight. Evidently, that's not the case with wine tastings.  You make your first choice and the one-ounce pour is served in a regular sized wine glass.  Then, you return to the bar for each choice after that. The only thing I didn't dig, is that they didn't rinse the glass when you returned for your next choice.  So, if you had a red wine, and then returned for a white wine, a little of it was mixed in with the other. Again, I don't profess to be a wine dude, but this doesn't seem right to me, if you are trying to get the true flavor of each wine.  I didn't stay here overnight; I just did a day trip.  But they have several suites you can stay in, and five or six houses on the sprawling ranch that you can vacation in.  I spoke to one of the guests who was staying in one of the suites, and he said it was \"absolutely awesome\"!"

The winery piqued my interest but I was really hoping to see more flowers as we went up the way.  Seeing the sign for chocolate made me stop in to see what was waiting for me. There were multiple flavors with pecan in the name. Each truffle is $2.95 and individually packaged. I chose 2 of each - Pecan Rum, Pecan Toffee, and Peach Bourbon. The truffle tasted great but not with a hint of pecan taste or crunch though. I could taste the bourbon but not the peach.   Maybe the next time we could enjoy some of the wine on the rooftop terrace for sunset."

This suite is the penthouse and while the rooftop is available to all guests during the day, from 10pm-8am it's for penthouse guests only. Needless to say it was so much fun.   During the day we hung out and explored the property and the gorgeous surrounding areas and we made use of the hot tub one night and the fire pit for s'mores. It was really just an excellent and amazing weekend. Johnson city is super close and we had dinner in town one night which was delightful.   The views were BREATHTAKING and if you want to see stars, the rooftop is THE place to see them!"

                "description": "This is a very pretty location and the woman working was super friendly. There were plenty of places to sit and enjoy some wine. The view from the roof is very pretty and definitely worth a visit just for that. The wine prices seemed reasonable to me, with a lot of options in the $40 range.  Due to COVID they will only do bottles, not just a glass which is no problem at all, except that's where my negative part starts. I asked for a chilled red (don't judge me, it's 105F right now) which they didn't have. I rarely drink white so my partner and I finally agreed on a dry rose. There are two on the menu, one sparkling and one non. I wanted the non-sparkling but before I could say anything the lady said \"oh, we're out of the sparkling rose, have the cava instead\" and popped it open. So, we wound up with cava. OK, I kind like that but it was two levels away from what we asked for.  I realize that sounds slightly petty so the other issue is that we asked for a tempranillo to go. When we got home we realized it was a rioja, and not very good. We didn't get either of the wines we wanted.  I'd be a lot more willing to give a better review if the place had not been literally deserted when we arrived. There was no one there but us so I don't see much reason why the wines got that messed up. I wish we had been asked about the cava before she opened the bottle."

                "description": "We have driven past it many times and always said we should stop.  We finally did.  I was pleasantly surprised.  What I thought would be a road side tourist trap was an exceptionally good road side tourist trap.  We met a couple at the wine tasting room who had the same story - they finally decided to stop.  The bartender / sommelier was a very pleasant fellow.  He offered good advice on the wines as well as things to do in the surrounding area.  Although we arrived too late for the tasting (630pm on a Monday), we were able to indulge in a glass of vino.  The wine tasting room screamed of fine Tuscan influence.  The wood was solid.  There was a majestic painting in the room to give it an elegant and distinguished feel.  The commode was fit for a king or queen (unisex bathroom).   After we obtained our glass of wine, we went to the observation deck.  We had 360 degree views of well, I am not exactly sure.   Just rolling hills.  It is hill country after all.  I am sure it would be a great place to watch the sunset, but it was quite cloudy on our visit.   I give this roadside attraction two thumbs up.  It is well done and great place to stop for a glass of wine."

                "description": "My first and only visit.  I would have left a ZERO rating if that was an option.  1. We walked up to the bar and the lady behind the bar (late 40's to early 50's with glasses) was not friendly at all.  She did not greet us nor did she ask if this was our first time nor did she let us know if  she would be the one to serve us. Very poor demeanor.  However we let that pass and still decided to give the place a try.  2. While sitting at the bar area we noticed a stale cigarettes and ashtray odor, coming from behind the bar.  Just nasty , not sure if it was the bar area, bartender or trash.  3. We asked for the choice of five wines taster and how that was served The lady behind the bar answered the question by saying we can't use 5 glasses because we don't have enough to serve you all 5 tasting glasses at once.  Never really answered the question we asked. However we did note that the wine glass area had a huge selection of clean glasses. I guess she has an aversion to washing wine glasses [ see #4] .   4. We ordered our 5 tasters. They give you 1 glass of wine  and 4 'poker' chips.  When you order the next sample they take your dirty glass and 1 poker chip and then pour your next sample into the dirty glass. One would think to RINSE OUT THE WINE GLASS  so as to have a fresh CLEAN glass for the next sample.  The lady NEVER  cleaned the glasses after we tried each wine, even after we pointed this out.  5. The worst part about this visit was that the lady [older lady, a younger one showed up to help ]  was eating cheese and crackers while she was working behind the bar , and talking with her mouth full and food was falling out of her mouth while serving people. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.  6. The area behind the bar was filthy , boxes on top of the counter close to the bar top where customers sit,  the bar top was sticky, not once did we see the bartender wash her hands between serving customers or between eating her food and serving customers.  YOU SHOULD LEARN PROPER HYGEINE TECHNIQUES.   We had a our taster and left.   We wont be back and we will make sure to tell everyone we know to avoid this business and find a place further down the road.  There are MANY other wine tasting rooms, wineries and more that have clean facilities , better hygiene and friendly staff."

Arc de Texas does not make their own wines if that's what you're looking for, they sell different wines from all over the world. What makes this place stand out from being a glorified bar, you ask? The service is GREAT. The tasting room staff are knowledgeable in what they think you like - their usually right. I love that you can do a tasting of 5 different wines. What wine bar do you know that allows you to relax on a roof top patio and really just ENJOY the best parts of Texas? This place also doubles as a vacation spot with rooms and houses to rent. This place was perfect to end my anniversary with my husband. Can't wait to come again."

In case you have missed it, RER now has food...and DAMN! I got the pulled pork Cubano and my wife got the Hawaiian Pulled Pork. Her sandwich was really, really good.  She even said once it was gone, \"I miss it already.\" My Cubano was a brilliant twist on a traditional Cuban, with the traditional ingredients, including pickle, ham, and mustard.  The addition of their house smoke pulled pork sent it into the next level. The beer here has been excellent from day one, but with the addition of a killer menu, this is now a one-stop shop that really needs to be on your list.  Summing up, phenomenal beers, next level sammys, and really great people.  Why more does one need?"

Idk if that's normal but it's not very appealing. We ordered everything but pinto beans. The food came out and the bbq was room temp. Everything tasted great but I wasn't sure how the food for the only customers in the place as well as the first customer of the day since we showed up at 11:15 wasn't hot. Not bad bbq, just bad execution of the details."

Tim, the owner and brewmaster, is happy to tell you about his craft beers, including the Norwegian yeasts he selected for their compatibility with brewing in hot Texas weather.  To keep startup costs down, he did almost all of the construction himself - check out my picture of the beer flight holders he made from lumber.  Speaking of flights, I decided to try all 7 of the beers on tap. My favorites were the hazy IPA and both of the stouts.  All of the selections were solid.  I didn't see any food on the menu.  The interior space features an L-shaped bar good for socializing, a comfy love seat, a mini pool table, and whimsical touches such as a guitar sitting in a stand, ready for someone to pick up and play.  If hanging out indoors isn't your thing, there are a few outdoor tables under a ginormous oak branch.  While I also love the brewery around the corner, I plan on working Reck 'Em Right into my rotation!"

And the great ciders they serve up certainly do not hurt the wallet or the ambience.  It's so relaxing sitting at the picnic tables out among the oaks listening to your favorite band. Strategically placed fans hidden among the trees aid in making the glade that doubles as a stage tolerable even on 90º days.  In these seemingly never-ending days of the pandemic, it's also refreshing to see the servers masking up indoors and out. I tend not to venture out too much for exactly that reason, but felt totally safe here even when ordering inside the tap room.  Maybe I should keep it a secret, but it's also one of those places you want to share exactly because it is so very special."

The only issue we ran into was that we ordered hummus, and the person taking our order didn't let us know that it didn't come with bread or anything else to eat it with. Considering we had just had a conversation with her about it being our first time there, we're about to present she didn't let us know that important bit of info. Not a big deal, and the person who brought us our food outside asked if we had ordered anything to eat it with and quickly brought us an order of a baguette.  Aside from the establishment itself, the vendors selling goods were all friendly and talented, and the other patrons of the establishment were friendly as well. We struck up several conversations with passers-by.  I would definitely go back!"

They often have wonderful live music and their drinks are absolutely perfect for a Texas summer. They are so refreshing. We got one of the picnic baskets and it was full of yummy cheese, sliced meats and bread. Highly recommend!  It is worth noting, they do not have a full lunch/dinner menu. They basically have an assortment of DIY charcuterie boards, which we really enjoyed. However, if you go expecting a full dinner you may be disappointed."

                "description": "I have been a long time fan of Texas Keeper Cider. I love the Tap Room, the grounds, the staff and especially the cider. The cider is dry and they make a wide variety of ciders to appeal to many palates.  They have successfully reopened the Tap Room and I decided to have my belated retirement party there. I was able to reserve a space for my large group and the staff was very attentive. If I had one criticism, it would be their food choices.  It's now a make your own picnic, and you choose cheeses, meats, and sides. It's not really a charcuterie tray, as they don't prep the plate.  The cheeses,  meats and bread all need to be sliced.  This made eating difficult with a large group. Most of my guests had to leave early so they could go eat somewhere else.  I know this new menu makes it easier for the staff, and they are a cidery, not a restaurant, but I miss their old menu.  I will still go to Texas Keeper Cider, but may not hang out as long.  (Or make sure I eat beforehand!) Overall, it's a beautiful South Austin gem."

Came on a rainy day with some girlfriends after dinner, and we LOVED it. It reminded me of Jester King Brewery because of the fact that it felt very off-road and secluded. If you're driving at night and a little too fast you might miss the entrance, so slow down as your GPS tells you you're near. The stone cobble walkway is so organic and lovely, that it felt like we were entering into a storytale cottage. Upon entering, everything screams wood and warm pinterest vibes. The three of us sat down at their tall barstool table, and started on our flight! What prices! Normally they do 5 for $9, but they tapped out of one of the selections so we did 4 for $7! Such a great price for the variety of ciders. I loved their hefeweizen + cider combo, and the first cider on their flight list (a name I forgot). Everything was so juicy and tasty, would highly recommend coming back.   The staff is very knowledgeable, and the lady doing the taptending that night was so sweet and helpful. She trusted that we knew which selection we were on during our flight. She also told us that there are five cideries in all of Austin! So for my cider lovers--let's hit all of them up."

If you're a fan of Argus Cidery, you'll like this place. I do think Texas Cider Keeper is making cleaner ciders than Argus (nothing was infected or had off-flavors).   It's easy to miss the entrance, but it's right next to the cemetery! The outdoor space is very quaint but all Texas and has tons of picnic tables. The tasting room is beautiful with butcher block tables and plenty of seating.   We opted for the tasting flight menu which is five 2 oz. pours for $9. Their mainstay Texas Keeper Cider No.1 is dry, refreshing and well balanced. I'm not a fan of sweet ciders, so this was perfect.  I also really liked their Grafter Rose -- which is made with Rome apples and some grapes, which gives it the beautiful rose hue. It's also on the drier side, which is nice.   Our least fave of the five had to be the Cider Weizen, which had a bit too much coriander (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES coriander and hefeweizen beers).   The bartenders were all knowledgeable and really try to give you an explanation of each cider they're pouring (a la a wine tasting).   They also have a tempranillo wine on tap because in Texas it all falls under a \"fruit fermentation\" permit. Apples, wines, it's all the same permit.   I'll be making it a point to come here more often, and I would if traffic getting through downtown and south Austin traffic weren't so bad."

                "description": "My new favorite place in Austin. Love everything about it.  It's basically the only Place I ever want to be. If you haven't been yet- get on the ball!  The cider is so delicious - nothing is overly sweet and they have a good assortment of dry and well-balanced choices. Their sampler is 9$ for 5 generous pours and is a great way to find the cider you like most. For us it's the rose, but the original is a close second. Your best bet is to purchase a bottle and drink affordably. You even get a discount when you purchase bottles to go (although I'm not sure if that's just at the end of the night - we've closed this place down a few times).   We are also big fans of the food. The carrots in a blanket are so yummy and very unique! A must-have. The curried egg salad is a go-to as well. It's made with eggs from their own chickens! They also add pickled veggies on the side which is always a win for me.   The location is so spacious and beautiful. Plenary of tables inside and out. Even a great view from one side where you can watch the sunset over the trees. I've enjoyed live music there and loved the tunes they were playing inside."

It's a beautiful place at night to sit out on the lawn under the string up lights with your dogs and enjoy some cider.  The bartender was awesome and more than glad to educate us on all the stuff that goes into making cider.  Our friends got this HUGE cheese board that was really well priced too."

                "description": "One year later I returned for their 1st Anniversary Party and release of The Grafter Blanc.  For $9.50 (w/fees) your ticket included your admission and 10 oz tulip glass (not the standard 12 oz tulip most breweries sell for $5-6). There were no drink tickets included; all cider and other offerings were for purchase only.  Certainly not the best deal in town....a town full of breweries with taproom festivities.  The Grafter Blanc is definitely my favorite of their ciders, with the perfect balance of acidity, tartness and dryness."

                "description": "Wow! So before coming here I always assumed ciders as overly sweet and flavored froo-froo drinks for those who don't like beer. I have never felt so mislead before! Cider is made from apples (no matter what the flavor), and real, legit cider is found here! It isn't overly sweet and there are many different kinds! Some reminded me of wine and a not-so-Sweet cider mixed together.  At Texas Keep there is room to bring a large group, or even the dogs or kids to run around. There is a small indoor area with games and a huge outdoor area with room to move about and enjoy the Texas sun (or stars).  The people here really enjoy and are PROUD of what they do. They are excited to tell you the story behind the names of the ciders and what they entail. They have seasonals and guest bottles and taps. Normally I would feel gross trying something out of a bottle opposed to tap, but the whole experience was so eye-opening, I didn't care. They told me their 1 bottle of (maybe a 750ml cider) has about 10mg of sugar in it as opposed to he \"cider\" I knew such as Angry Orchard that has upwards of 50mg PER BOTTLE! Yowza- no wonder they were too sweet!  I was definitely iffy about coming here since they didn't serve \"regular beer\", but I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone- and you should, too!  Only reason it's not 5 stars- the food \"truck\" setup (not a truck just a station) was out of food by 6:30p on a Saturday night. We had ordered 1 of the 4 items on the menu for our group to try. When we went back to order our favorites, they claimed they were out of everything and turned around and took 1 more order. Annoying. So we ordered a pizza and left early to meet the delivery man at home. Maybe have more food or more options and we would've stayed until the 9p close."

We've been here during all seasons of the year and the property is always gorgeous and inviting. Staff is so knowledgeable and helpful. The kitchen is Now built in to the main tasting room. The fresh house made popcorn is absolutely awesome. This is a family friendly establishment as well and very nice of them to accommodate young children in a pretty adult setting! We are very thankful and grateful and it certainly keeps us as loyal customers."

We brought our dog too but he could not go inside which was challenging even for ordering. Our favorite cider is the No. 1! There was an event going on that sounded fun so we will definitely check out those options. We did not order food, just did a shared tasting. No one came outside to check on us or offer to pour and tell us about the cider which is common when visiting wineries with our dog and friends. It's a cute little spot for a weekend drive."

They had live music on Saturday when we ran into this cute spot.  We ordered a flight of cider and had some garlic kettle corn, but regretted not getting the cheese plate because it would have been perfect with the acidity of the cider.  Zach, who served us, made our experience more memorable.  Definitely a spot to visit when in Austin."

You can hang out and play bird games or sit outside on picnic tables. The food is not quite  awesome yet, but decent if you want tot munch along with your cider. The ciders are dry dry dry and not gross apple soda tasting like Eastciders (barf). \"Stillage\" is amazing."

                "description": "I've been here four times and will keep coming back. The location itself is beautiful - plenty of outdoor space surrounded by forest and a valley. The ciders are so much better than what you find in the beer aisle at the grocery store, and they have a surprisingly large selection. During the week, this is a great place for a quiet, relaxing evening. During the weekends, especially when they are hosting a festival or band, it's a different atmosphere (but still great) - lively and fun, a good place for friends to hang out if they're tired of the usual bar scene.  The only negative preventing Texas Keeper from five stars is the new food menu. While the ciders are fairly priced, the food is anything but. We ordered a cheese and meat tray for $20 and got a platter with barely enough for one person. When we asked for more crackers, they charged us $2 more. Hopefully, this new menu is still a work in progress and they will make adjustments until it is reasonable."

Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

                "description": "I feel conflicted giving a fairly low rating given I consistently think of ABW as one of the top handful of breweries in Austin, but I'm giving this as a rating of the taproom experience moreso than a rating of their beers. I've also only gone during Covid, so I'm looking forward to giving them a try in the future when I can comfortably get the full experience.   Compared to other patios in the area I find theirs to be pretty lacking. There were no fans in the summer and no heat lamps in the winter. Their space isn't particularly large so there are fewer tables than other locations. This leads it to be uncomfortably packed on weekends, both in terms of how close tables are and the lack of distancing enforced in lines.   One weird thing working against them is just how available their beer is around town. Every HEB and bar will have at least a couple of ABW's beers available, so they lose out on the necessity of going to the taproom to try their beers. Even their seasonals get around town pretty well both in stores and on tap elsewhere.   On that note, and to not make this review totally negative, their beer is absolutely phenomenal. All their flagships are good to great examples of the style, my personal favorites are the Sun Shovel (think blue moon but with some hop prescence) and Fire Eagle (leans more towards West Coast IPA, but has enough juiciness to be really refreshing in the summer time).   Their seasonals also absolutely knock it out of the park. Sputnik (Coffee Oatmeal Stout) is an absolute must if you're in Austin in December and is probably the best beer I've had since moving here. The Heisenberg (a combination of a Pilsner and Hef) and Black Thunder (Black Lager) are two other stand outs to me.  The food truck is good enough that if you need something to snack on while you're there you won't be totally dissatisfied, but I've usually felt compelled to go elsewhere for food.  Overall, can't recommend their beer enough, but you don't need to visit the taproom to get the full experience."

                "description": "After three months of sheltering at home, Austin Beer Works was a first outing.  They did an excellent job with social distancing, wiping down each table after guests left, and mask enforcement (when not seated at table) in a firm but polite way.    No inside seating right now and the outdoor tables are shaded and a good distance apart. It is reservations only. depending on the time you make the reservation for, you will either get an hour to enjoy your table or two hours.  They go over all the rules with you when you arrive.  They have some great beers, both on tap and in cans. You can purchase some to take home with you as well!  I ordered a sour raspberry-lemon Einhorn.  So summery and refreshing!  I ended up drinking two.  My husband had an Essential IPA and the Small Spoon session IPA.   We didn't care for the Heisenberg Heff-lager (a bit too banana-ish).  The only thing that would have made the difference from 4 stars to 5 would have been some kind of food! Even a bag of chips or pretzels to go with the beer would have been awesome! We saw a food truck parked there but unfortunately it was not open."

The staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgable, but I think the best part of the experience (other than the drinks) is the atmosphere. The interior is very spacious which makes it a perfect space for a casual happy hour with coworkers while the exterior has an abundance of seating. I'll definitely be returning if I am ever up that direction!"

We waited in line with a mask on and ordered. The man was helpful and recommend the cherry sour to me since they don't have ciders. My boyfriend got two different lagers, one was dark and one was light(I think it was called like the best ever or the most awesome) he liked both a lot but preferred the lighter one, and I really liked my cherry sour. It would be nice to see breweries trying to use class beer cups instead of plastic but with covid most places are doing single use plastic sadly. We took our dog and everyone was friendly. They even give you chips and salsa with your drinks. The ambiance was great, there was a food truck, and a cool courtyard with tables and a kids area. All around a cool place!"

We were so worried about our local hang-outs surviving the pandemic and couldn't be happier that Middleton not only survived but is coming back stronger than ever."

I was impressed with the table cards that help guest determine if tables are clean or in need of cleaning. Overall very clean space.   As it relates to the atmosphere, like mentioned kept very clean, and customer service is great. Service was great inside was helped decide what drinks to get and given samples of a few to help make decisions. Service was also great outside with the food truck.   For the quality and experience the price for everything was great! The beers taste amazing and the kombucha was fantastic. The burgers were very tasty. Best burgers I've had in a long time.   A sight you just see for yourself!"

                "description": "I'm going to get this out of the way real quick.  There was a cat walking around on the bar.  Yes, you heard me.  ON THE BAR.  I knew it was a dog friendly place, but come on - a cat ON the bar?  It even walked over to my side of the bar, sat down, put its leg behind its head like cats do, and then proceeded to lick its butt in front of me.  Hey cat, I'm really impressed that you can do that, but you're not getting a tip from me.  The staff member that it belonged to shooed it away, but it stayed on the bar.  Subtract one star for this show.  Next up:  As I said, it's dog friendly.  VERY dog friendly.  There were two dogs belonging to customers roaming around freely inside the place.  A third dog was on a leash, but it kept barking at the other dogs.  This wasn't outside on the patio, this was all inside.  When I go somewhere to hang out and relax, I don't want to deal with barking dogs (in my book, it's akin to bringing screaming kids into a bar).  Subtract one star for letting the dogs inside.  Keep the cats and dogs *outside* and this would be a five star brewery to chillax at.    Beer:  They have a decent selection of brews and like most breweries, they have some permanent ones and some seasonals that rotate in and out.  They have five or six store bought wines available.  Staff:  VERY knowledgeable about their beer and can suggest something for you once you describe your taste palette to them.  Food:  The food truck out front is permanently hitched up here, the one in the back changes occasionally.    Plenty of seating inside and outside, there's even a spacious deck on the second floor.  Growler refills are $14 and crowlers are $9.40 (buy three crowlers and get 10 percent off).  If your selection is over 8 percent ABV, additional charges may apply.   One more note about the dogs and I'll put this puppy to bed.  There's a fenced off area downstairs to let your dogs run rampant in - put them in there instead of bringing them inside - or better yet, leave them at home.  This whole thing with people bringing their dogs everywhere is getting out of hand.    I was going to give them two solid stars, but now that I think about it, if they let cats run back and forth across their bars, how clean is their brewing process?  It's a cool place with good brews, and I want to like it, but when I think about the animals everywhere, I think twice about what might be in the beer."

The table next to us also had multiple issues with their orders that they were loudly complaining about. I asked for the loaded tots with no beef and he said he couldn't ring them up that way. We weren't asking for a discount, just remove the beef???? So then he said to get regular tots and add cheese and onions/jalapeños. What did we get? Plain tots. He was also so fricking unfriendly. The table next to us retired a burger that had the bun top black/burned, and apparently he complained about redoing it. Brewery needs to rethink this employee."

                "description": "Middleton is a must if you're stopping by or even in the general area.  We were driving from Wimberley (a fun day at Jacob's Well) towards the San Marcos outlets, and had to double back even to come to Middleton! We were so glad we did. My bf even walked out with their peach crowler...just a warning though, bring a cooler of some sort so it doesn't explode in your car with the heat! Totally speaking from personal experience, sadly.  We shared two rounds of tasters, which come with 5 different selections. So come with friends and try them all! You'll be surprised at how delicious they all are. Middleton is also HEAVEN for Belgian lovers. Good thing we love Belgians. Little did I know that a microbrew outside of Austin would be a great place for craft Belgians. I'm an all-around beer lover--everything except saisons, NE pale ales, and lagers, whereas the bf is a Belgian enthusiast. He always goes for Belgians. So you can imagine why we decided to get a taste of everything Belgian. I also enjoyed their Easy Ride PA, but was not a fan of the chile IPA (to each their own). It was almost impossible for me to compare and contrast the beer quality to the all-around atmosphere of the place. It oozes joy and love--they have brew dogs (and customers can bring doges too) who basically just lie around and nap, PLUS they have popcorn that is self-serve from those tiny machines that you see in Disneyland and other carnival events.  Will definitely be back to Middleton. Clean restrooms, and large space indoors for bigger groups (WITH TV's!) and cool fun outdoors games like human jenga outside. There is plenty of parking in their private loose, gravel parking area, and they had a food truck parked right outside. Awesome spot, great beer, fantastic space!"

I will confess I am not a huge beer lover but my friends are and were raving about this place so we  stopped by to watch the Euro Cup game between Germany and Italy.  The brewery is well design with great bar space and patio area. Dogs are welcome so bring your pup, children not so much ;-).   Step up to the bar and build your own beer flight you get five picks of 2-3 ounces each for $12. There wasn't a beer I didn't like! From the Porter to the American Red there were all good!   Live band was great and the two flat screens more than met our soccer watching needs.  So if your looking for a place to get your hops fix in the Texas Hill Country this is it!"

Wonderful atmosphere.   2 world famous brewery mascots; Pinky the dog (as white and large as Gandalf's horse). Dunkel the cat (omnipresent and all-knowing)  Dunkel is the sweetest cat and deserves to be in the brewery hall of fame. Some heartless punk in the reviews below complained about Dunkel. This same guy has a Lonestar beer as his profile pic, so at least we know he has ZERO brewery review credibility.   As a result Dunkel's been banned from the taproom. So, Thank you, Lonestar bro, for driving out from your big city to a enchanting, rural, authentic hill country brewery and complaining about an animal for no good reason.   Knowing the type of compassionate, animal-loving people who frequent this place, I'm sure we can rally together to #FREEDUNKEL."

My wife and I are avid animal lovers and thus it's hard to describe our feelings about this place. On entering, there were numerous dogs wandering around and a cat walking across the bar, and after we sat down there were animal feces and urine on the floor. Needless to say, this was offputting to our group. Unfortunately, we did not notice the animal waste until we had already ordered. The service was average and somewhat lackluster. Nobody checked on us after we ordered our beer. As for the beer, it was good quality craft beer but nothing stood out at us. Take him away the issues with the animal waste, we still would not have found this an impressive venue and probably would not return. This is truly a shame, given the place's 4.5-star reviews on Yelp."

They have the floor marked off for social distancing while waiting in line to get your beer.  There was a plexiglass in front of the bartender and the card reader was placed so you put it in the reader to pay and the bartender does not have to touch it.  All the tables inside and outside were at least 6 feet apart and the walkway was set up so you did not have to walk by any tables.  The brewery was very clean and I felt very safe there with this pandemic we have going on."

It is located in the middle of a business park, but once you get on the grounds you feel like you are truly transported. Not only do they have their brewery and taproom on site, they also have 4 food trucks! You can pair your beer with tacos, pizza, bbq, or amazing ice cream!  My personal favorite beers here are their sours. They keep their menu fresh and change it up frequently, so if you see something you might enjoy, go quickly! The best part about their location is the open space and seating area. There are so many tables and benches throughout the back and they even have a stage with live music on certain days. The environment is so fun and you will see lots of dogs and children around too. I appreciate that they have a playground for kids.   If you are not a beer drinker, they also serve cocktails made with seltzers and amazing coffee drinks! I love their vanilla latte and will opt to get that most of the times I go there!  Overall, there is something for everyone here! Between the drink selections, food options, seating area, and live music, everyone in your group will have fun! I will always recommend Meanwhile!"

No hard alcohol, but I feel they make up for it with their creative cocktails and house-made seltzers.   The food trucks give enough variety that there is something for everyone -- pizza, BBQ, Mexican, and the BEST ice cream! But the best part for me is sitting back in the Adirondack, cold drink in hand, watching my little one playing on the playground with a live band in the background.   I hope we continue to get more places like this in Austin!"

You can get everything from world class tacos, great pizza to Texas Monthly Top 50 ranked BBQ.   The beer is absolutely amazing. The collabs with local breweries and bars such as Cosmic and St. Elmo are all cool and tasty -AF.   The to go beer options are always great. You can have a few pints and come home with some amazing beer to finish the night at home watching a movie with.   I've seen a few shows here. Saw Eternal Champion here and had a blast. The venue is great for live music, anytime they have a live show its worth the cover to hang out and see some live tunes and have some amazing beer.   The best thing about Meanwhile for me happens to be that its extremely family friendly. They have a playground a soccer court and large open field that is perfect for flying kites. They are all fenced in so its the perfect spot for me to bring my daughter to play. My family comes here regularly and we really enjoy the family friendly aspect Meanwhile offers.   I could go on and on about how much I love the beer and just this space in general. Its really do not miss Austin location now.   Thanks for offering so much good stuff Meanwhile you rock!  edit: I almost forgot to mention how awesome the coffee and breakfast tacos by Pueblo Viejo are here."

We had an IPA and a cider, they were good, not life-changing, but decent. I have yet to sample the entire beer selection but I will. And you know why? Because of everything else the place offers ensures I'll be back.  The tacos from the taco truck were really impressive, exceeded expectations actually. The pizza was equally excellent.   The set up for the grounds was spot on. The trees, the playground, the environment with families, dog owners, young people, it all meshed well because everyone had a section that fit their methods of socializing.  You can't tell me this isn't a science because significant thought (and money, I'm sure) went into developing this experience. Bravo!  Now I need to drink some more of their beers."

                "description": "This is probably one of the best breweries that opened in ATX in 2020 - during a pandemic at that! Since their opening, they've been doing gangbusters business with no signs of slowing.  Obviously, when you visit, you'll notice they have a huge space and $$ was spent to fully build it out. It's not a small brewery that grew up, it was built to be big. There is plenty of seating inside and even more seating outside on the turf + mulch area. But, be forewarned this place is busy. Saturday afternoons are packed with people with pets and families. There is a playscape so parents like this place.   Now, to their beer. Meanwhile brews consistent and good beer. They have a variety of beers from regular German Pils to New England IPAs. Nothing infected and nothing with off flavors. They always seem to have a good rotation of beers.   Don't like beer? They also have wine, cocktails and coffee! Something for everyone.   While they don't serve food, there are numerous food trucks to order from.   Even though the lines can get long, they do move pretty quickly (especially the line that is at the main entrance).   We would come here more often if it were closer to us, but getting across the river is the hardest part. :)"

I'm always mystified by ANY questionable servers ... don't they know that if they'd give better service, they'd get better tips?!?!!   3 stars to the beer"

                "description": "Since my last review about Meanwhile's extraordinary support for the community, we decided to return that support and have hung out in their beer garden a few times, enjoying different brews and chatting while people-watching. There are so many trees to shade the area and a playground in the middle for kids to stay entertained and out of their parent's hair. The inside area is clean and modern and very hip with good air conditioning (so important during the summer, well, really 9 months of the year).  We would have been seated there but are still cautious about the Rona. So, good beer, good vibes, good venue. And food trucks though we haven't tried any yet. Cheers!"

There was a kid's bday party there and we didn't notice (yay for our dog). There was plenty of water to help yourself to as well as a nice list of beers. They were all incredible (even the German ones)! They also have some cocktails, frozés and coffee available. We got an iced dirty chai on our way out, since their coffee looked and smelled good. WOW! Nice and strong! I am very picky about coffee being too weak and having to add extra shots of espresso, but this was on point!  We will definitely be back! Great, friendly staff, and we especially loved that we could order beer starting at 10a on Sunday! In early and out early!"

Its nice to have some variety of food choices with the pizza, bbq, and Mexican food offerings.  It seems no matter the day of week or time of day, one or two of the trucks are not serving food even on weekends.  Speaking of weekends... unless you are into family oriented madness, with kids running amok everywhere, because of the playground equipment and soccer pitch avoid this place. We enjoy dining out or having a couple of beers at breweries to kind of get away from life's madness, not to have to deal with this kind of madness."

                "description": "I chose this place for my birthday gathering of around 15 of us on a Friday afternoon and so glad I did!  I wanted to find a Dripping Springs like brewery without making my friends drive out there and this fit the bill.  Some tips below!  Parking - As Austin gets more and more crowded it's hard to find spots for large groups that are quasi central and have ample parking - this place seems to have enough street parking since it is out in the middle of a warehouse district that is empty on weekends.  We were all able to find parking with no issues.  Kids - this place is super family friendly.  My friends with kids felt very COVID safe due to the size of the venue and there is a spaced out area with a playscape.  Drinks and food - I had a few of the seltzer cocktails and they were good enough.  Obvs this is a brewery so I wasn't expecting too much in that dept.  You can order drinks at a window outside which also made us feel safe.  There are a handful of food trucks where our friends ordered.  Also we got there at 2:00 pm on a Saturday and were able to snag a couple large picnic tables.  I think that bc it is new it is not getting too crowded yet.  There was plenty of shade for us once we moved one of the tables around.  There was a ticketed show starting at 7:00 pm that Saturday that required a $10 cover charge so def check their website before arriving if you don't want to pay a cover.  Overall a great addition to the breweries popping up in the southeast Austin area."

Their beer is so good, especially their hazy IPAs. The vibe is so relaxing and cool, with picnic benches under the trees. I hope they open their indoor seating soon, and extend their parking and outdoor seating area. I always bring my friends and family who visit from out of town and I recommend it to everyone whose looking for a must-try local Austin brewery!"

We're usually the only ones on the playscape, and there's always at least one food truck open, plus the cafe.  There is plenty of outdoor seating (inside too, actually), and it's dog and family friendly. Easy parking in their lot, I've never had a problem finding a spot (again day time during the week).   I can't wait to go here for date night!   Highly recommend."

                "description": "The space was vibin'. Plenty of tables and chairs. Also a big playscape crawling with tons of kiddos. But off to the side, so they weren't annoying for the hungover heavy drinkers. On-site soccer field with goal, some dudes were playing a fairly serious game while i was waiting in line for the most delightful chicken tacos with guac and fresh spinach from the Pueblo Viejo food truck.  Reason for 3 stars - worst Paloma ever. Like ever. I was suspicious when i realized the Paloma was listed under 'Seltzers' (after i had ordered :/ ). Then grew more wary when the 'bartender' added WAY too many dashes of bitters ((( when a real Paloma is plenty bitter from fresh Texas grapefruit ))) and it was TERRIBLE. Straight gross.  Also one beer was ok, the Tender Robot- Hazy Ipa. Not anywhere near as caustic as Pinthouse Pizza's Electric Jellyfish, fairly enjoyable. But the only other beer we sampled (the Kolsh) was incorrect, no bitter finish, weak and thin.    So, come for the vibe! Come for the food!  Avoid their weird Seltzer Cocktails Choose carefully (or ask for a sample) of their beer before you commit to a full pint."

The beer is good, staff is so friendly, it's so cute inside, the PLANTS on the shelf are adorable, the food trucks are great...I can't find fault in it at all. Besame is a must-try for ice cream and Dough Boys for pizza. Distant Relative has amazing BBQ chicken!"

The brewery has plenty of outdoor seating, plenty of parking, clean, new facilities and interior as well as nice views of their brewing equipment. To put it concisely, they check just about every box you could ask for!  They have an interesting selection of beer including a few blends I had never seen elsewhere, the most notable of which was their \"Moot Point\", a coffee-infused amber. Glad to say I can recommend this brewery, the great atmosphere as well as the impressive selection!"

                "description": "Meanwhile Brewing is a great space in South Austin to hang out with family and friends.  I kept hearing that Meanwhile Brewing was one of the best breweries in Austin to bring your kids, and now I see why!  There is so much open space for kids to run around and even two little playscapes.  I brought my 7 and 2 year old and they both had a blast.  My husband and I were able to enjoy some good drinks and food while the kids played.  I should mention - the brewery isn't just for families.  Parents with kids were in the minority when we visited on a Thursday night.  The brewery is great for anyone.  In terms of food and drinks, I'm kinda embarrassed to say that I actually didn't try any of the beer (I know, I know, I'm just not much of a beer drinker).  I did try the frosé (yes, I'm basic), which I enjoyed.  It had a floral note to it, which I really liked.  For food, there are four food trucks on site and our family managed to try them all.  My husband and son raved about the brisket from Distant Relatives, while my favorite was the Bob-a-rita (margherita) pizza from Dough Boys.  I also had pretzel and strawberry jam ice cream from Bésame.  I know, it sounds weird, but it was awesome.  I loved the balance of salty and sweet.  I highly recommend it!  Overall, Meanwhile Brewing is great and our family definitely plans to go back; there is something for everyone to enjoy!"

I seriously had no idea this place existed - I spotted it when driving by and had to do a U-turn to check it out.  It's been open about a year, has a clean bar and seating area inside, has a covered outdoor patio, and a food truck.    The brew is good and cold, they have 12 of their own brews on tap, including two meades.  64 ounce growler refills range between $16 and $25 depending on the brew you choose.  A six flight sampler is available for $9. You can even purchase six packs of some of their beer to take home with you.  Plenty of room for the kids to run around outside and stay out of your hair.  They have a corn hole washer game, the \"ring-on-a-string-on-a-hook\" game, a giant chess board (you know who you are), tether ball, horseshoes, and a swing.  Try the Buff Hefeweizen and the Sunset Lager - both are sehr gut!  They have sodas and water for $1."

A little landscaping to eradicate the poison ivy around the oaks would be nice.   Tried a couple beers and settled on the Tang IPA. Refreshing on a hot day, with a hint of citrus, but not terribly awe inspiring. Bring your own munchies. As they're a few miles from anywhere, they could use a food truck.   Really like the setting and we'll definitely try to make it back next time we're in the neighborhood to give it another try."

Bought a six pack of Sunset Lager as a compromise to the better half and really enjoyed it. They are certainly off the beaten path but are worth the effort.

They have some interesting flavors, but nothing too crazy like some of the Austin Breweries. Every beer was good, but I'm going to say the Kimber Lyte was my favorite. An easy drinking beer with more than 5% alcohol. Tang IPA was finally a great tasting IPA, which I normally don't drink... don't worry they have other IPAs for IPA lovers.  The Stout was pepper flavored but good.  But they also Change things up and now they have a coffee stout.  Plenty of other beers to taste.  They have growlers and some of their stuff is bottled.  Hard to find in grocery stores.  Try HEB in San Antonio. And total kudos to the Bartender, great knowledgeable guy."

The location is just off of 173 (I think) right near 281 and 46. The location is quaint with beautiful trees. As we drove in, the first things that I noticed were the games set up around the yard. They have a large chess set, corn hole, a swing, and a game were one has to swing a ring and catch it on a hook. The second thing that I noticed was a barbecue food truck. We had gotten subway sandwiches to have with our beer but ended up getting a little barbecue also. We headed inside and were promptly greeted by the bartender. The building is really clean and the tap set up is modern. I ended up doing a flight which has 6 samples from the list of 12 beers on tap. All in all, a really great experience and will definitely plan on visiting again!"

We visited this place with friends and their 4 year old daughter was attacked by a massive dog who was situated next to the kid swing. Based off how the facility handled the attack it was clear this dog had been there with his owner multiple times and the bartender actually defended the owner and his dog, saying it was a \"good dog\" and the owners are \"good people\", even after the owner made threats to my husband for stating that the dog should be put down. Given how everything was handled, I would not be surprised if that dog is back on the premises next week. Please do not risk your children's safety by taking them here it's not worth it."

Again, no trouble recommending this brewery to others...and we'll definitely be back many more times."

                "description": "Beer was mediocre... I generally don't have high expectations for microbreweries in Texas and I would lump the beer here with the rest of them. Tangerine IPA was one-dimensional, drinkable but that's about it. Facilities were clean and spacious. We chose to stop by here because I had heard good things about it and Yelp claimed they're \"Kid-friendly\"... This was FAR from accurate for us. I came here with my pregnant wife, my 3-year-old son, my good friend from work, his pregnant wife and his 4-year-old daughter. In the time it took for us to find a table to sit at outside, my friend's daughter was attacked by a large mastiff-labrador mix. In a matter of a few seconds, this dog managed to escape its owners and clamp onto my friend's daughter's torso, leaving several puncture wounds, scratches an bruises in the process. Once everything was all said and done, the bartender on duty defended the dog and its owners. There was little in the way of apologies or effort to rectify the situation. I had to call 911 to ensure authorities were made aware of the attack and dog's vicious nature. I would have expected folks working the establishment to at least handle this; they did not. After EMS and Sheriff personnel handled the situation and left, I witnessed the bar server on duty taking a smoke break with one of the members of the dog owner's party... clearly small-town, take-care-of-your-kin mentality going on here. I do not recommend coming to this place unless you're part of this inner circle."

They had a good crowd  sampling their wares. They have beer on tap, in bottles and growlers.  They also offer flights so you can taste the different beers that they brew.  I got a sample of their IPA and really liked it. Took home a six pack.  Bartender was super friendly. Will definitely stop in again."

I had multiple beers from here, but my absolute favorite was the Dye It Black.   It had such great flavor and was very easy drinking.  The other ones I sampled were also really great and it was very difficult to choose.  This brewery is kind of out in the middle of nowhere.  It's got a rustic outdoors-ish feel to it.  There were benches throughout the brewery to sit at and nothing was done up too fancy, and almost felt like you were hanging out in someone's garage (which isn't a bad thing).  Patty was our bartender and she was absolutely fantastic!  She offered wonderful hospitality and when she found out it was my birthday, she bought me a birthday beer!  Tip - If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free pint glass to take home.  It was a great souvenir to have to remember this great brewery!"

Technically they don't own where the tables are so another company is sponsoring it and letting us sit at the tables and enjoy your beer to go. You can't enter the brewery at all so there is a porta potty, you pick up your beer at the window to go and can sit down outside and enjoy. Their growlers are also awesome!"

Located after Hudson Dam, nestled in a small retail/manufacturing area, you can drink inside a small area with full view to the tanks used to make the product or sit outside on wooden benches/tables.  On weekends, they have great 2-3 person music sets, sitting on top of an antique delivery truck, or inside, depending on the weather.  Personal favorites are the Peanut Stout (think Guinness but with more flavor), the Czech dark lager and my wife loves the Sex Appeal!  The bartenders are all fun, with stories and a bit an attitude, feels like old Downtown Austin.  If you are a local or guest of Austin, Infamous is a must place visit!"

It is a very no nonsense place. They serve beer, 1 cider (decent since not super sweet) , and wine. This place is all about the beer and you can buy a flight to try the different types. Some of them are interesting to include a coconut stout.   You can sit inside or outside on the picnic tables. On Saturday night they had a live band playing who was decent. You can bring your dogs as it is dog friendly. It had a similar feel of Moontower without the additional activities to do. It's all about drinking beer and relaxing here.   FYI, they apparently they have pizza and pretzels. Not sure since I didn't see anyone eating it, I would suggest bringing your own food or having it delivered as you have that option."

                "description": "In this town, if feels like there's a brewery popping in every corner. I'm not complaining, simply making an observation. But what this means though is that you have to do something to stand out. You can't just brew your own beer and sell it in the warehouse, those days are gone.  Hold Out has a unique and very advantageous situation. They're next to Better Half (I think they're the same owner or partners?) and make great use of the property together as well as the opportunity to collaborate.  Additionally, Hold Out has their own food. While their menu isn't as complete as Better Half's, it's pretty decent for a \"happy hour at the brewery\" trip.  But you can't asses them without considering the Better Half contribution, which I've reviewed separately and loved.  The beer is good, although it lacked range in variety as there wasn't much darker beer. A lot of IPA selections, which I'm sure the market loves...but I don't.   I stuck to the lager and a couple other beers, all with weird names but I guess that's the game these days.   I had the vegan frito pie which was way more delicious than expected and had an interesting mix of flavors.   Of course, it all tied in well because we had dinner from Better Half and I don't need to tell you how good that was. You gotta try the grilled halloumi, trust me.  All in all, good vibe, great property."

They have a spacious outdoor patio that's great for dogs, and a convenient parking lot right across.   I ordered the fish sandwich and a strawberry sangria, and both were a hit! The sandwich came with delicious fried fish and various sauces (with a bit of spice) in between amazing thick toasted slices of bread. The sangria was refreshing and sweet, great for those who like fruity beverages!"

The food arrived an hour and a half later. I am confused how it could've taken so long for food to arrive. To make matters worse, the waiter said \"sorry for the hold out\" and laughed when he gave us our food. I held out on my laughter for that one. It should not take that long for pancakes or burgers to be prepared. No clue what was going on behind in the kitchen but the chef definitely holding out on cooking or something. Hopefully this was a one off experience, but I'm not holding out faith for this place."

                "description": "Wow, I would say this was our favorite place on our recent trip to Austin, tucked away on a side street off of West 6th it is a true hidden gem although no hidden handshake was needed to enter the converted spacious quonset hut.  Out side under cover were rows of picnic tables, beer was served inside and the food was brought out.  While the beers were outstanding, the food was unexpected, beyond the burgers which we did not try, they had a few interesting dishes such as a Crispy Artichoke  and Pimento and a Indian chickpea inspired take on the chili Frito pie, both were excellent and we are not vegetarians, we just wanted to try something new.  The smoky Rauchbier styled Marzen (?) was unusual and worth a taste but a pint was a little over the top.  Note for those who commented on slow service we were there on a Wednesday and there were no issues, I am sure a nice weekend might be another experience."

Only place in Austin over a 5 day weekend that refused to serve unmasked people. Apparently covid only spreads when you're in the main building ordering. SCIENCE.  What a joke. Food and beer was OK, but there are PLENTY of awesome open and free restaurants in Austin that don't have arbitrary and ineffective covid rules.  I wouldn't advise walking here with a hungry family in the cold if you're opposed to conforming to mask mandates.  We escaped from Seattle to have a non locked down weekend, super bummed to have caved and supported this place.  They'd probably be checking vax cards like back home if they could.  Disappointing."

Good drink prices and a good selection of beers, but I didn't find the two beers I tried to be anything special. They have a great food menu and the burger is really good, but it took quite a while for my food to come out. The ordering process was also a little chaotic -- long, long lines and loud music at the counter so it's hard to communicate with staff. Parking can be a nightmare if the lot in the back is full, and the roads are very narrow and uneven when you arrive at the brewery. Ultimately I think this is a good place for those looking to get the Austin experience, but I don't think I'll add this place to my usual rotation."

Vegetables are fresh and crunchy, the beets are chilled, the nuts crunchy, the small pear shaped tomatoes are excellent and the dressing is outstanding.  1/2 for $6 is incredible value. The burgers are great and the crispy chicken sandwich (during the week ar lunch) is one of the best in Austin and for the price is perhaps best value too. Have had some ciders that seemed very vinegary and perhaps not right but food is always great."

Hold out has a covered patio with a good amount of seating and seating inside. Our favorite part by far was the bartender that helped us. We didn't get his name but he has red hair and a mustache to match. He gave us some awesome recommendations to check out in Austin. Go for the beer stay for the hospitality!"

Love any place that offers beer flights, as it's the best way to really know what you like and what your taste buds are in the mood for. I typically go for lagers or Belgian-style beers and personally loved the Lingering Sunshine and Wit-Tington.  The atmosphere is chill, laid-back, and the plants everywhere are totally my vibe. You can tell it's frequented by drinking tours as there was constantly small buses/vans waiting outside for parties drinking inside. Music also made for a nice ambiance and the girls who took care of our order upon arrival were very sweet and informative."

A no nonsense brewery where I genuinely enjoyed every beer I tried-- A gem!   We sat at one of the handful of the tables they have sprinkled in the sidewalk outside. The street was pretty low key for being to close to 6th, so it was enjoyable on the sidewalk! You still order at the bar which was no problem, and the service was quick and efficient!   Rhythm is a Dancer stole the show for me! It's a sour, but it is muted enough that I could drink multiple without my mouth being pursed from tartness! The Kolsch was great, as well. We also tried the soft pretzel which was SO airy which I loved. It also came with a garlic sauce so not your typical pub pretzel, but a very tasty take on one!  Employee's wore masks and maintained distancing, as well, which is great. We found this brewery on a list of spots still enforcing safety restrictions, and can confirm they were!"

                "description": "The 30+ times I've been to breweries I've discovered that they truly are the happiest places on Earth. Customer service and courtesy are typically top-notch because...well...it's a brewery.   First let me point out this rating is based more heavily on service than the wonderful beer they served( I'd give a solid \"B\" on that spectrum).  Walk in, bartender says \"hi\" and starts cleaning mugs. We look around trying to figure out when he'll actually approach us. Ok...oh look menus, guess I'll grab one. Standing there waiting for the \"what can I get ya?\" Or \"first time? Here's our menu, let me know if you have any questions.\" Bartender jargon. Nothing. My wife says \"yeah it's our first time here.\" \"Oh, ok\" responds bartender. Finally we decide on our own we'll do a flight and order a pretzel. I'm assuming they specialize in IPAs since they have 4! He takes the order.   I return a beer because a random fly fell in one. I tell the bartender I hate to waste good beer but can I get a new one, a fly fell in mine.\" No reaction, he just asks which beer and refills it.   Good craft beer, subpar service."

My sister and I were visiting Austin, TX awhile ago and wanted to do an Escape Room -- There is one right next to this little brewery, so after we finished the Escape Room (we escaped, by the way!), we decided to enjoy some beer and celebrate.  This spot is in a less busy part of the city and there were not a lot of people inside, but I was in love with the interior decor and the ambience. Very calm, chill and relaxing. We enjoyed our beers too! Overall, I loved it and wish there was one near my house."

The ambiance is nice and quite very retro with a \"we work here\" feel which is a good feeling. The bartender was very helpful and attentive. Overall loved the experience and worth the stop if your in the area."

                "description": "Being from San Diego we were excited to try some of the local breweries, but literally from the moment we walked in it was severely disappointing. Not only was the staff rude, unhelpful and basically wanted us to leave at 2pm but the beer was ok at best. The bartender was so rude asking loudly why are there people here right now (during normal business hours) but anytime we asked about the beer he would say it's on the list. I get it might be busier than normal but there was no line other than our group, and all they did was pour beer no food running or drink running. Now to the beer, out of the two flights of 8 different beers 4 were tolerable and this is from people that don't leave alcohol behind. The sour was decent but heavy, the wheats were way to heavy and honest can't even describe them lol. Anywho long story but won't be back; if I want to be treated like crap i at least want a decent drink"

However, I liked that it was fairly empty. We could talk and hear each other, no line for more beer, the guy working was very nice, and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. I'd go back here in a minute, either earlier in the night before the rest of the evening plans or for a break inbetween places. The beer was good, and the place is very clean and pretty inside."

                "description": "Came by with good company for some brews on a hot Sunday afternoon. The women-lead space and brewski selections are rockin', but they're missing a key component--wifi.  I know, I hate sounding like your typical phone-using human being, but every time I'm downtown wifi is super handy. It helps us decide where we want to go afterwards! Anyways, Central is set up like your typical clean and succulent-friendly microbrewery these days. They have board games and serve yourself water (sparkling OR still. THAT's a first!!). They don't have outdoor seating, but plenty of seats indoors. They also sell small bites and other drinks like wines and ciders. Their guest list is pretty solid with brews from Zilker and Independence to name a few other Austin loves. I got a taster of Central's own beers. We really did not enjoy the milkshake IPA that had a strong vanilla aftertaste. It was way too sweet, but to each their own.  Their restrooms are clean and they allow outside food too. SCORE! Now if only the owners would install some wifi...our taptender told us that the owners are still getting that set up. So that's a great sign! They also don't validate parking, so if you need to drive to get here...come on a Sunday when parking is free downtown. Pro. Tip."

                "description": "Their beer is so good, light and refreshing. If you like sours, they got you covered, ipas? Sure they have that too. You can of course get a flight of beer to taste multiple flavors and I'd recommend doing that...then going back and buying a pint of what you loved the most.   The service was A-1. The woman at the front was very friendly and was open to answering my 500 questions about when they opened, if I can taste different beers, what're those people in the corner with the purple drink drink drinking? In addition to that I'm pretty sure the owners were also just hanging out in there and they were chatting with different guests which made it feel very homey and inviting  Price- on par with other breweries  Great location! Especially if you're just moseying around town ( like I was) and happen to stumble upon it.   The aesthetics are on point. Beautiful Edison bulbs and plan fixtures. Both benches and tables so you can come with a large group or chill on a date."

                "description": "I really wanted to like this place - as I need a local cigar shop- but you cannot overlook their blatant disregard for local COVID requirements.   First, the shop is quaint and located in a very cool shopping area off of HWY 12. They also have a decent selection of classic and unique cigars. That is the positive.   However, they are selfishly thumbing their nose at COVID regulations. The staff does not wear masks or require patrons to wear them when they are up and about. There is absolutely no social distancing and it is usually packed to overflowing on weekends.   When a business refuses to abide by local and state guidelines in something as serious and life-threatening as COVID, it makes you question where else they ignore health and safety protocols. I do not trust that they keep their shop or the tobacco products safe and sanitary if they are unwilling to adhere to these basic guidelines. This should be a MASSIVE red flag for anyone thinking of shopping here.   I do not trust an establishment with this mindset, nor the local authorities that refuse to enforce these rules. It is shameful."

We quarantined with each other for months. We stayed 6 feet away from one another. I know; I was there nearly every day. It's difficult for any business who had to navigate the tricky waters of early 2020's pandemic onslaught. It was new territory for everyone and significantly different messages coming from authorities in the \"know\".  And with all that being said, you have a fairly recently opened small business trying to survive.  IMHO, anyone hating on this establishment is welcome to stay away.    Great cigars, great beverages, great community support. Don't change a thing.  Levi"

When by pure coincidence I met a couple who I have not seen in years. We mentioned that we had cigars but it was too windy to smoke em. They said there was a chill cigar bar right up the street. We watched Tiger make a par on 18 and off we went.  We were greeted immediately by Allison, the manager, and given a quick tour of the venue. There are comfy seats and a small bar area that serves beer, wine, and water. The humidor is laid out very well and their cigars are stored perfectly. Allison patiently explained that there are two sections in the humidor the usual favorites and \"her\" boutique cigars. I selected a beautiful light Nicaraguan rolled cigar. This baby smoked smooth right down to the label.   The lounge itself is ventilated nicely so you are not smoking in a haze or smoking your cigar and other guys cigar as well. There was also a good beer selection. We had a blonde ale from Two Wheel Brewery in Buda. Good choice.   Smokey's is a chill venue, friendly patrons, and professional knowledgeable staff equal 5 stars all day!"

She gives you the low down of every cigar and helps you find the perfect one for you. She's really nice and very helpful in her descriptions.

We thought their airstream would be a fun \"man cave\" addition to an otherwise very feminine wedding...boy were we misguided! Half the bridal party and many of our female guests ended up checking out the cigar bar and loved it! As a woman, I feel like creating a space where women feel welcome in what is traditionally considered a masculine space is a clear indicator of the quality and professionalism of their business.  Not only was Chris helpful, very communicative and and priced well - he and his wife were so much fun to be around! They both made our day special and unique and I highly recommend them for events. They definitely went above and beyond to ensure the day was special and went smoothly.   The airstream itself is luxuriously appointed and classy. Their cigar storage and bar amenities were top notch and I'm sure their huge tv would be great for sports games and such. Definitely a fantastic addition to my big day and I'd highly recommend them!"

Orders their burger with truffle fries. Pretty tasty and those fries were crispyyyy! Would go back just for the views.  The beer was okay but that's not the reason you come here."

                "description": "Made our way to The Oasis during a recent trip to Austin with some friends. It was definitely a bit away from the main city, but a beautiful scenic area. The Oasis is right on Lake Travis, and features a bunch of small stores and outdoor areas in the land surrounding it. We were there on a Friday afternoon, and surprisingly not a lot of stores were open, which was a bummer. Of course though, we were there for the brewery, which we were able to make it to. They offer plentiful indoor and outdoor seating; it was a nice sunny day so we opted for the outdoor seating. It was lovely outside but it was SO windy, even after we tried to switch locations outside. It was hard to keep our food from blowing away! The view was super nice though, so despite the wind, we appreciated the scenery surrounding us.  For food / drink - of course, I focused on beers. I was a bit disappointed to learn that they didn't offer flights - they had a good number of offerings, it would make sense to do flights! Oh well, at least they offered half pours, so I was able to try 2; I went for the gose (kiwi dragonfruit) and the Oktoberfest. Both were OK, not the best ever beer but refreshing; I definitely favored the gose! My friends enjoyed their pours as well. For food, we all split some apps, going for the OTXBC trio, the bretzel, and the truffle fries. The trio was a bit disappointing - it was underwhelming and a little piecemeal (we had thought everything would be mixed together but it was just a pretzel on top of the chips with the dips on the side). The bretzel itself was tasty, but the sauce was interesting; we thought it came with queso, but the dip we received looked nothing like queso and was thick with chunks of something in it (pepper maybe?). It was tasty, but unidentifiable. Lastly, the truffle fries were the best option - they were nicely seasoned and crispy with a large volume. We all enjoyed those! The prices were relatively reasonable for what we got in terms of quantity and quality.   Overall, we enjoyed our afternoon at Oasis Texas Brewing Company. The space is lovely with a great view, but the food and drink is just OK; you're definitely more there for the experience. I would definitely make it back to OTXBC during a next visit to Austin to try more beers and take in the nice view!"

We got to experience and enjoy the best of both in a way.   Amazing fresh made as well as barrel aged cocktails, a nice range of food options, and of course, breathtaking views.   The Barrel Room is rustic chic with fancy couches and a pool table. The tap room is plain rustic with a live music stage. The tap room had burgers and sandwiches to accompany the beers brewed on site. The barrel room offered pizza and wings to eat in between cocktail sips.   Oh, don't miss observing the really cool stairs in between the two floors."

                "description": "Have some family in town and wanted to take them somewhere to watch a good ol Texas sunset. OTBC has some of the absolute best views in all of Austin. Even on this cloudy day the sunset still peaked through and gave us a show.   Drinks are good but food isn't really anything to write home about. Its more about the experience you get here for sure.  They have a large parking garage and parking lot on site with plenty of free parking even on a busy night. There's also a golf cart shuttle to get you from the lot to the entrance if you need it, but it's also a walkable distance.   Really great spot to visit if you want a nice spot to watch the sunset and definitely has that wow-factor for visitors!"

The space is large and everyone seemed to be following the safety rules while indoors. We were a party of 8 and we had plenty of space.  I ordered the basic burger and they usually prepare it Medium rare. I asked for medium well and wanted only mayonnaise and cheese. It was cooked the way I requested but was very dry since they did not give me Mayo. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos (3) and said they were great. She ended only being able to eat 2 and another guest finished her last one. She said she would order again next time.   All in all is was good just not great."

The whole experience overall is just underwhelming? If thats the right word. There is always the steps  1. get in line to get on to the wait list 2. once in front be told the wait is 1-2 hours 3. get in line again for the bar  4. finally get seated and wait again for slow service.   One question is Why? Why would you even go here? The wait is 2+ Hours sometimes. The food is cafeteria quality at best. They are SEVERELY understaff. Oasis Brewery has better food and literally the same exact food. The quality of the experience over all does not justify the amount of time, money and effort for this place."

The Texas skies are truly breathtaking during this time and Oasis is perfectly positioned for patrons to see all that the sun has to offer. Come 1 hour early to snag a table next to the railings in order to get the best (unblocked) view.   Food: 3/5. My date and I only ordered the Pico Verde. It was a refreshing snack but nothing special. We would've ordered more but there wasn't a huge selection and nothing that caught our eye.   Drinks: 3/5. Very limited selection of beers. It's almost weird that this place is called a brewery because there are literally like 8 to pick out of. Most people just come here for the view though so it's not a huge problem.   Overall, definitely a gem in Austin. It's a great place for dates or just to hang out with family or friends. It's so pretty here that it doesn't even matter what I'm eating or drinking!"

We were at the brewery on third floor, ordered some beer and food, kitchen was bit slower than normal (they were busy! So that's fine), we ordered 3 items and they only gave us one and the guy took my call alarm and about to walk away, so I asked him where are my other two items, and he looked confused then asked me, else you ordered? So I told him what they were, and took him a minute to look around, and it was sitting right next to the first item, but he just simply looked confused!  I wouldn't suggest to come during busy weekend, unless you don't mind of waiting longer time, and getting mixed up on what you've ordered.  Overall still a great place to take visitors."

Oasis Texas Brewing Company has a wide variety of beer selections and delicious food. The views are breathtaking and really romantic especially when the sun sets. With the relentless Texas heat, nothing beats a tall glass of cold brew and a plate of parmesan truffle fries while enjoying an amazing view of Lake Travis with good company. If you're not a fan of beer, they do offer wines, ciders, cocktails, and margaritas. Speaking of margaritas, a true Texan can always tell if a place is good if their margaritas are on point!"

For the beers we had Grand Cru Dark Ale and Samurai Lager.   The Grand Cru Dark Ale comes in a small cup. The server assured me that was a good amount unless I was really found of dark ale. He was right that was a good amount because that beer is strong.   I pretty sure I wasn't going to finish the beer if I had asked for a double sized cup.   Really nice experience over all.   I would recommend this place a million times."

Texas weather is just right this time of year, the views make you want to make the drive from Cali to the lone star state just to get that perfect pic over the lake with a drink your hand in the free state of Texas....but don't be disappointed when you are greeted by a not so friendly mask police manager that wants to wear his mask under his nose ....   the guacamole had zero taste the salsa was watery and had zero flavor... the chips were the bottom of the barrel... all of the guests seated around us were unhappy and didn't receive good service either but were happy with the views. The fellow guests/visitors we met were super cool and that was the best part... the drinks food and service were way below average... what is it with these places? get it together! the views bring us there but you need to pick it up from there... managers are clueless... bartenders were so rude....embarrassing for Austin...  so many visitors and this is their first impression of Austin unfortunately... we can do better.  We ordered 2 pizzas and left 80% of them on the table....Tasted frozen with ragu sauce.... I can't even begin to explain the regrets I have going here... The guy that gave us a ride on the golf cart up was very nice and now I feel he may have been trying to warn us about going there..  Bathrooms were gross and tables were nasty... nobody was cleaning up after people.... trash and masks everywhere and near the water... I follow not unfollowed their social media page and the pictures are very enticing but it's the exact opposite of what you actually get... from the drinks to the food.. Fire pit was a nice touch.. we stopped to talk to other guests there on our way out... Its a one hitter quitter for all..  won't be back... what a waste of location."

I was really impressed with the scenery and view of Lake Travis, the fact that parking is free and that this location is really affordable.  This brewery offers an immense and spacious interior and exterior to enjoy your adult beverage and your company with a vining atmosphere and beautiful view. Honestly, this place is the place to be to hang out with friends and family or a date. :)  The affordable local brewed beer is amazing. Fortunately, as I am not an avid beer drinker, this place had a Wisconsin sourced stout and I am grateful they had a seasonal stout to offer to those with a stout palate. That just made me so happy because I wanted to drink with my family. They do have a full bar on the 2nd level but we didn't want liquor.  The bartendar, black guy with nice eyes and hair, was so patient and helpful. He even let us taste one of the crafted beer. Reason for this was because the website (menu via qsr code) was not updated to reflect what they had and we had to select what we wanted again lol. So he was just great and patient.  My brother in law ordered some food which I think is not really worth it BUT if you didn't have the chance to eat and didn't want to drink on an empty stomach, then go for it. Otherwise, if you're hungry and you wanted a meal, yeah, no, eat before you come here.  I can't wait to go back just to enjoy the ambience and energy with great, affordable beer!"

The only trouble is it's on the 3rd floor and the elevator has been out of service for 3yrs so whatever you have you're carrying. We got amazing pics and they actually have a nice selection of vegan options! We were pleasantly surprised and stayed here a while. Drinks were just OK. My husband has IPA's and I have Rosé and whatever I drank gave me the worst headache. They're not carrying top selections but since people come for the view I don't think they care. Nonetheless - we'll be back for sure! We just can't bring visitors unable to walk 3 flights of stairs. There are wheelchair accessible views on floor one though so still worth the visit."

I completely love visiting here and I try to keep suggesting everyone to go here at every chance I get. Hahahah!   Parking can be little tricky on a weekend evening/rush hours. But we eventually always find it (maybe 5-10 mins of struggling later). They have enough space for free parking.   There is \"Spicy boys fried chicken\" food truck here at all times, which is just absolute best. Again, I can go and on about the delicious food they carry, but this is about the brewery itself. The food truck is a beautiful perfect cherry on top.   The brewery carries wide range of selection, and I thoroughly enjoy them. The service people are also wonderful. If you sign up for the rewards program, you can save some money down the road. So I suggest to sign up online for it.   Dogs are welcomed and Thursday evenings they have live music performance going on. Enough seating indoors and outdoors.  Definitely visit here and you can thank me later ;)"

                "description": "As we drove to the brewery it seemed like a bit of a strange area at first. The brewery is located in an industrial park that has some other stuff going on. We were surprised by how full the parking lot was.  We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and decided to sit outside and it was very hot. There were fans but it didn't seem to help much. I will note that there was indoor seating available.    The food truck that was outside was really cool. We got the cauliflower wings with the Korean Buffalo sauce. You can order on your phone or at the window which is nice.   You can order beer inside, they have a variety of different options. I tried out the hop water (no alcohol) which was really interesting. Sparkling with some whatnot a tartness from the hops. We tried the hazy IPA which was pretty hoppy, probably not the best on a hot day. The staff was all very nice."

They don't sell flights, but they can sell you a half pint if you just want to taste a few different beers.   When we arrived, it wasn't too busy and you could just sit wherever even though all the tables had a reserved sign. Later on we returned for beer to go and noticed that you had to wait to be seated.   They have a food truck on site that also sells vegan items."

I was treated like royalty here -- the bartenders handed me a binder with tasting notes (that was theirs for reference) and they checked on me as I was working there for about an hour. Great beer, good vibes...I just wish the food options were better. I hope they will eventually cycle new trucks there."

The coffe cream ale was delicious, and I don't do beer and after the tasting I got a glass!! Hubs got the hazy IPA-said not the best he's ever had but he likes it. He also got the double IPA and gave it a 7/10. They had 2 flavors of frozen cocktails too: strawberry limeade (tart) and frose.   Cute outside area. Inside smelled a bit like sushi...but they weren't selling any on the premises. ‍"

Lots of great flavors going into the beer here. They have Inside seating and outside seating, with a food truck on location for some grub as well. Overall great beer and a really cool vibe outside."

There is also a food truck that stops here and pairing fried chicken with beer is a winner in my book anytime."

I moved to South Austin this past October and my friends recommended this spot as one of their favorites and it's the biggest reason I'm so happy to be in South Austin. The staff and overall vibe have been so warm and welcoming, and it's a great place to chill, chat, drink and eat.  I'm definitely biased because of my name, but I love the Carl. It's a perfectly crisp and thirst quenching beer, and super affordable and easy to drink - especially on Fridays when they're $2. The beautiful Carl merchandise (glass and hat) also makes me cry as a kid who could never find tourist trap memorabilia with my name noticeably missing on the license plates around Carla and Carlos.  The taps change regularly with the updated menu easily available from their site or instagram. I always enjoy the fruity sours they have.  Post-Covid19, I've wanted to keep supporting this spot and the seamless transition to grab and go crowlers and growlers with online ordering makes it easy. I did my first one today and it scheduled a pick up about 30 minutes after I placed the order. Went right in, gave my name, and they brought it out for me."

St. Elmo has consistently awesome beers (focusing largely on traditional stlyes, like their flagship kolsch Carl) and is suuuuuuper dog-friendly.  There's no better way to spend a few hours, in my book, than filling my face with stout and passing out pets to allllll the floof.   Fantastic food truck, soursop, on-site.  Tap list is regularly updated on insta.  Killer coffee shop further down in the strip, Spokesman."

I ordered the beers and asked her for recommendations, and she said \"The Carl\" and nothing else with no smile or anything. My husband then approached her to ask where the dog water bowls were and she said \"they're out there,\" again, with no further help or comment. He tried asking her again saying we didn't see them, and she said \"they're out there\" again. Not coming here again!"

Beer is alright.  One of the lagers is so-so but the raspberry sour is pretty good."

Beers:  I have been enjoying the melon + grapefruit notes in their Simcoe Pale Ale as well as their summer seasonal ale Vaquero Ranchers lager that is just easy and smooth to drink down on a summer day.  Unsure what to get - check out their crowlers to-go and canned beers! I grabbed a sixer to take home with me the last time we were here just so I can try the variety of other options they have here.  OH! Also I noticed they have a frozen drink machine too!  check it out for me, eh?!  Food:  We came here on a weekend and there was a crawfish broil happening to our surprise!  Easy to order online, at your table, and/or at the counter. I really love the option to order directly from your table and be able to pay without having to get up and go to the counter especially if you are nailing that ping pong game against your friends!  We really enjoy ordering and eating pizza here as Southside Flying Pizza nails it every time and there is enough to enjoy with everyone.   Outside / Inside:  all COVID safety measures are practiced here and taken seriously both inside and outside.  There is PLENTY of seating outside and ample amount of space to move around without it feeling crowded at all.  Snovid: When we experienced about 5 days without water we noticed that Last Stand Brewing were offering water fill ups. We grabbed our containers and made the quick drive down South Congress to get our fill.  I am SUPER appreciative of the kindness, ease, and availability to be able to get some water for our needs during the snowpocalypse that all of Texas experienced.  I will forever be in debt to Last Stand as the showed their genuine willingness to help their community out in a time of extreme need.  THANK YOU, Last Stand! You are truly a life saver.  I appreciate your kindness and help always!"

It's by far my favorite brewery in Austin, they always serve great beer, good service, live music and delicious pizza.  I celebrated my birthday there with close friends and everyone was impressed."

We were stopped when walking in the door by a rude ass employee (dark curly hair with glasses) literally yelling at us about a mask from across the room full of people. We are fully aware some spots still require masks and as we tried to ask if we can sit outdoors she rudely interrupted us and continued to tell us she won't serve us unless we have a mask. Shit lady haven't you ever heard of customer service or even normal communication. She could have approached us and explained their policy it was not necessary to demean us for making a mistake.      We walked outside my sister was livid and embarrassed. I talked her into staying and me walking in with my mask since she has forgot hers and her sitting outside on the bench area. I saw the employee again and asked if we could sit outside at a table which was our original plan (if she listened and didn't scold us like children) she said I can order since I have a mask but my sister can't leave the table with a complete attitude. I ordered got the beers, drank them and we left.      The beers are good but not worth the rude inappropriate staff. There are plenty of local breweries with good vibes and good beer! Don't waste your time."

                "description": "My friends and I enjoy the atmosphere, but we frequently don't get good service here. The bartenders don't seem to be on the same page as far as pour amounts go, either. Depending on the bartender, you may get a tap beer in a small plastic cup or a pint glass. I asked a female bartender why that was, and she said they do either \"double\" or \"single\" pours. I went back the following week and asked for a double pour of the same beer from the week before - this time with a different male bartender - and he said they only do beers in pint glasses. I guess there is a lack of communication on that front but it's resulting in customers asking for double pours and being charged more for what should be the normal amount of beer and frankly that doesn't sit right with me.  The value of the food from Southside Flying Pizza is also overpriced. The quality of the food is not equal to what they're charging, and they're frequently out of menu items and condiments by the evening. I've never been for lunch but their \"special\" is a slice of pizza for $4, which hardly seems like a special to me considering the quality of the pizza.  They make tasty beer, though!"

I tried the Craftsman Light and Texas Forever. Both were great tasting brews. They were both light with very distinct flavor notes from each other. I loved them both! They also went well with food as they are crisp light beers with a smooth finish. Glad that this place is nearby, I plan on grabbing some beer from here on a regular basis."

First off, I really liked the atmosphere. there is a bunch of outdoor seating, which is always a plus.  For drinks I got a flight, so I got a variety of beers. Overall, they were pretty good, however, they don't have a lot of variety in the styles available. I also got a slice of pizza, which was much better than I expected for brewery food. All said and done, it's definitely a spot worth visiting, but isn't the best that Austin has to offer."

Food/drinks - i have yet to have a bad food item from these guys. Everything is delicious and surprisingly thought out. It will take you by surprise. And the drinks. There are plenty of options to taste and enjoy based on your preferences.   $$$ - it is a little pricier then you might expect. But truthfully, for what you get, I will continue to come back here and spend the money.    Give it a shot. I do not think you will regret it. I would recommend this place over Pint House pizza or even Dominoes ;)."

                "description": "10-24-21  As you can probably figure out, I like beer.  This is my drink of choice. And visiting breweries just takes the experience to the next level.  Quality/Quantity - Beer was mediocre. My family did not like the menu here, so I was pressured to quickly finish my beer and sadly leave.  It should be illegal to only drink one beer...  We hit Trader Joes on the way back and realized they carried the whole line of their beer, so as you can guess, I got two more six packs:)  Now, I am happier.  Atmosphere - You need a much bigger parking lot, especially since almost everyone drives a huge truck. We got lucky with a space, but had to share some of the space with the huge truck to the right and the huge truck to the left, LOL. Teri Joyce and the Tagalongs were playing tonight. They did a good job, the place was hoping. Both the inside and outside spaces are large; however, again too large for their parking lot. Can some people carpool? They also had a small outdoor stand to order beer and food. Additionally, there were plenty of seats at the bar. The team seems to be working pretty hard.  Service - The bartender was just okay. Not much to write about, I ordered, he gave me the beer, and I left; still left a tip though :)  Price - $6.50 + $1 tip  Owner Suggestion - Did I say you need a bigger parking lot? Wish I had more time to enjoy your place, but no fault of yours. Hopefully next time. Keep up the good work."

Food is hard to decide if you are lactose intolerant.  We found a Pulled Pork and it came with a pint of beer. We also got two pizzas for the rest to share.  We had the wagyu and 2 choice of the specialty pizza cauliflower. That was a good choice.  I don't care for beer so I had a cider.   They were out of watermelon So I had cranberry.  Very tart but refreshing.  The bar tenders were all so friendly and nice.  I didn't see anywhere to get beer flights and my son had his bday.  Nothing special like a drink or come out to table.

Every time I've been here has been memorable.  Showed up on a Saturday afternoon with a party of 25+ and we immediately found a group of picnic tables and spent the next several hours just enjoying each other's company.   Everyone enjoyed their food and drink but what we'll remember and what I'm most grateful for is the ambiance and hospitality at ABGB.   There's plenty of places to go eat, but when you have a large party and want to make memories with an Austin feel, look no further."

The food alone is worth coming for, it's upscale apps that are absolutely delicious and they also have pizza.  The con (and why I'm only giving 4 stars) is that this is a beer garden that has ONLY SIX beers available - all brewed in house. I wish they at least had some local options that made the beer list a bit longer, after all it is a beer garden. They also have a small list of ciders and wine available. The \"Industry\" Pilsner was great and a nice light beer but"

Seating is self-served both indoors and outdoors, and there is free WiFi! Masks aren't required here, and most people don't wear them inside or outside. The menu is on a QR code, which is posted on each table. The water station is in the back.   I got the beer flight $15 as it was my first visit. The pilsner is definitely my favorite; it's a popular one! It's odd that there's only 6 choices, but it helps especially for those who are indecisive. If you order one beer, it's about $6. When I visited on a Sunday afternoon, they had live music and many couples were dancing along. I totally missed the memo to bring my boots and hat.   I tried the Calabrese and homemade sausage pizza ($3.50 per slice). Both were delicious.   Obviously with the live music, it's loud inside, but it's a fun place to hang out with larger groups."

The staff are super nice and helpful.  The taste of the pizza is ON POINT!  We always have a great time here.  When you first walk in, the smell of the pizza is out of this world.  it's a great place to take friends from out of town."

It's nice because I can keep a running list of spots to check out when I find myself nearby and I don't need t hop on a zoom meeting with a client. ABGB is one of those spots. I stopped in here for a quick beer during covid and it was pretty solid, this is my first time back.   The wifi is good, clearly. I'm writing this review and it hasn't faltered at all. The beer selection is small, but what I've tasted has all been solid. Both in flavor and body, they are true to what they are brewing. Quiet and mellow atmosphere is lovely is for getting some work done and maintaining a medium focus. The garlic fries smell delicious.   The only downside is that I'm getting a little bug action. But I'm also sitting under a tree, in Texas, in June.     I'll be back and probably to eat."

I had initially come to this village for the sake of disgracing a rival with an extremely low offer. The coward was forced to accept, so my conquerors and I were in the mood to celebrate with ale and song. Our time here was a delight, and I wish them luck for the coming winter."

We have always been happily greeted and shown directly to our reserved table. Servers immediately appear and explain how to order. We write our drink and app order on a slip of paper and they scoop it up and bring it back just as we've decided on our main course. They leave you alone unless you need them but are right there if you place the paper on the stand for more beer or water or a box for leftovers. The website is very clear a reservation is required and it is a 2 hour limit. Once the time escaped us and an employee came by with \"a gentle reminder that your 2 hour limit is up\" Nothing rude there.   Covid deets out of the way the chef is awesome.  Food is amazing. We used to come only for white clam pizza and beer which is still an excellent choice but there's so much more to be explored on the menu. I had a peach and turkey with brie and avacado that was simply the best sandwich I've had in my life. Specialty pizzas are so so good. And the calamari and stuffed portobello were very tasty. This is better than elevated bar food.    5 stars ABGB. Keep it going! We appreciate you"

There's more than enough room for everyone both inside and outside; literally nothing to complain about when it comes to ABGB, The staff work quickly and make everything' as easy as possible. When we went, there were vendors there with Austin Flea and Hail Marley(Bob Marley cover band) playing outside. Can't wait to go back and try the pizza!"

Since they don't sell food, your pup is welcome and we had fun lovin' on some sweet dawgs! Uh, the four legged ones.  They are great at working the crowd and selling their beer glasses. Katherine was there at the door on the one day (Saturday) that we stopped by to explain how it works. Lots of t-shirts and ball caps to pick through and new fun people to meet. Everyone's happy with a beer.  I also love that Thirsty Planet supports Divine Canines, a therapy dog group that sponsors training for dogs to service hospital patients. Just wish they were open for more than 4 hours a week. Rumor has it this outstanding brewery will soon move to a new much larger space on South Congress."

Now, the \"free\" tasting is 3 tastes of anything they have on the board in the little taster glasses. There is an option to purchase full pours which includes a glass.  I have always been a fan of Thirsty Planet's beer offerings as I have had them at several brewpubs around Austin. Their Buckethead and Double Buckethead are my handsdown favorites! When I was out and about and headed to some other breweries, I stopped in here and was happy I did.  The staff was very nice and there is ample communal seating inside and out. They also offer tours, but I did not take one as I was a bit tight on time.   For a glorious afternoon in a chill atmosphere with great beer offerings and a little roadtrip out of Austin, this is a great place to spend it!"

It's cheap to get a few pours and most everything there is close to some ambrosia of sorts. I've definitely had the goat everywhere so I was glad to try the only-found in-house bevs.   I do not like IPAs so what did I try first, the double bucket head IPA of course. Awesome taste. Not so bitter but leaves you feeling good. Pretty strong so it was a great way to start the morning. I can't recall the other beers I tried but I do remember leaving happy."

I don't have any of the ABV info but it had a nice lemon taste to it. Very refreshing for the hot weather.  Thirsty Goat - American-style Amber Ale, 6.5% ABV. Had a nice spicy finish with the beer.  Yellow Armadillo - Light American-style Wheat, 4.0% ABV. Very refreshing. Had some citrus flavors in there.   There is a nice outside area with picnic tables and plenty of seating inside and out.   The guys there were so nice. Very engaging and informative when it comes to the beer info.   When I make it back to Austin, I'll definitely be stopping by again."

The outdoor \"patio\" area is lacking but the indoor tasting area makes up for it. From what I understanding they are opening another place soon.

We stopped by this place and had a swell time. The owner/brewmaster was super nice and friendly, in fact, everyone who worked there was awesome. If you don't want to drink three beers, you get a tasting glass and three free tasters. But then you don't get an awesome pint glass...   Only gripe? No AC (in August, yuck) and it is SUPER LOUD inside. And it seemed that the more people drink, the louder they got and it was just incredibly noisy.   If you like Thirsty Planet beers, or beer in general, definitely worth checking out."

                "description": "Checked out their brewery tasting and tour this past Saturday.  Warning: there are times it will be quite crowded like when bus loads of people stop by.  However, even despite the crowds, the bartenders did a great job of serving everyone.  $10 gets you a souvenir pint glass and three full pints (plus you can taste a few oz of the other beers they have for no additional charge, so really you can taste 7-8 taps for $10).  Their yellow armadillo and thirsty goat are both solid crowd and palate pleasers.  I liked their merch as well, bought a ladies tee for $18.  The tour was about 25 minutes long, but it was the hottest part of July and it was not a/c, so I think they mercifully made it quick for us.  We brought kiddos and the outside area was kid friendly, although not completely fenced in by the side of the road, which was a bit nerve wracking.  I wish I had brought some more small bills as tips collected in the tasting room go to a local charity, which rotates monthly or seasonally.  A fun way to spend a Saturday, would be even better in the cooler months of the year."

They'll also give you a small tasting glass for free, but why bother with that?   I've been a fan of Thirsty Goat amber for awhile, and this visit turned me on to the Hoppy Blonde and Buckethead IPA. I'll be looking for all of them at local bars.  The \"tour\" is one room, but hey they're a small business, which is cool. Very informative, maybe more than the average beer fan will want, but beer nerds will love it and it's not hard to step out and back to the bar if you get bored.   One downside, it was super stuffy in the tasting room. Not sure if their AC was acting up or just couldn't handle the crowd and the July heat. However, that didn't stop my group for staying and drinking until closing time. I'd recommend Thirsty Planet to any beer lover visiting or living in Austin."

We signed up for the tour online (which is free) but there was no list and it seemed like they weren't going to do the tour at all. You might have to remind them. Once we mentioned our interest, they announced it and a bunch of people joined in. I'm not sure reservations are really needed at all for this. The tour was fine, nothing to write home about. If you've done a tour before you've probably seen everything they have.  I liked a lot of the beer we had, especially the thirsty goat ale. They were out of the wheat but had a rhubarb beer which was interesting.  Staff were friendly and when not totally overwhelmed with people, happy to engage in conversation about the beers.   It did get quite crowded and I understand why. The outdoor patio is lovely when the weather is nice and they have tons of games. For me it was a bit too crowded and noisy, but that's the small price you pay for free - $10 beer. (You can either get 3 tickets for a small glass for free or 3 pint tickets + a keepsake glass for $10.)"

They were professional, yet easy to work with, responsive and surprisingly affordable. Jason did a great job behind the bar causally handling the beer orders while educating those who wanted about their beers.  PRO TIP: They use Sonos wireless music system, but do not have an external headphones jack. Download Sonos on your phone and the then manage/update your playlists and you can listin to an iTunes playlist by going to \"This iPhone\" (I assume the same for Android phones) and then Playlists. If you do not want an iTunes playlist, you can create a playlist in Sonos app ahead of time or play Pandora, Spotify, XM/Sirius, etc)."

I first tried their Buckethead IPA at Second Restaurant and enjoyed it enough to look for Thirsty Planet's website, where I discovered they offer tours most Saturdays.  No information about the tours is provided on the website, but here's the deal: sign up online, when you go there's an optional tour, plus four 4 oz. samples for free, or you can purchase the \"souvenir glass\" for $7 and use it to get up to 4 pints free...a nice deal (although, I don't know about you, but I couldn't consume 4 full pints in 2 hours).  They have a nice large indoor tasting room with communal bench tables and an outdoor patio as well (but it offers no shade).  On to the beer:  * Buckethead IPA - one of my new favorite local IPAs; it is well balanced with the bitter and hint of sweet, with a pleasing Amber color and a mildly citrusy nose.  * Thirsty Goat Amber - a lighter amber, malty but with a slight hoppy finish.  * Double Buckethead IPA - an even stronger bitter taste than the Buckethead...save this one for last. * Yellow Armadillo Habanero - I could definitely taste the habanero flavor, but the spiciness was tempered by a pilsner-like base.  It's surprising how easily this beer can be consumed."

Oh my... *smiles coyly\" This stuff was liquid sex.... and I knew it was going to get me in trouble.  So next up, I explained my fondness of the dark, but felt the need to expand outward, what would they suggest. The man behind the counter said without hesitation - \"Thirsty Goat Amber\"!  Boyo was he right! After two pints of that, I had an expression similar to the one on the label, so I took some time in my truck to eat a sandwich before driving away.  Yup, I'm going back!"

I also felt kind of weird about asking for a flight but then being told uhhh we're not doing those right now- seemingly bc the line was long. It was odd.  Small indoor space, kind of lacking something aesthetically - compared to other Austin breweries.   Good truck onsite but it wasn't that good :/  Overall just meh! But they host geeks who drink if you're into trivia!"

I went for the Beer My Valentine's event and the Garrison Brothers bourbon-aged Convict Hill and Indy's coconut-flavored Midnight Paradise were my faves.  Tonight there was an open area for dancing and the food truck Killa Wasi was there. Really enjoyed our time there though the great event turnout made the beer line pretty long. Will definitely return to sample other beers and see experience it during a \"regular\" day. Staff was very friendly and I enjoyed the stouts!"

                "description": "Love me some authentic microbreweries.  I haven't been to a solid microbrew spot since moving to Austin, so this was such a breath of fresh air. It seems like there are plenty of breweries that also double as restaurants and music venues--which is cool, I'm all for that, but deep down I'm a plain microbrew kinda gal.  Getting here got me so excited as our GPS took us to industrial surroundings AKA the location of every great microbrewery. There is plenty of parking, and they had a yummy-smelling food truck parked outside, but we already ate so skipped that. My friend and I walked in and immediately felt the warm, relaxed energy that Independence had. I couldn't decide on what pint to get, so I settled on a taster set of four for $10. Not too pricey. The selections were not really in my favor, as I tend to go for wheats, belgians, juicy or hazy IPA's, or oatmeal stouts. However, I knew I would find something I'd like. One can never be too picky about beer.  They also have board games and free stickers! I love that!! Their logo is the lone star on black fire--super cool. Our taptender was a wonderful and friendly man. I just wish he would have been a little more wordy with his explanations of the beer profiles. I'd assume that microbreweries attract devout beer drinkers and self-proclaimed snobs (like myself), so I would love it if he was able to elaborate more. Anyhow, I will be back even with a larger group (yay picnic tables!), but I hope that they have more varieties of beer, or that they rotate their taps often."

Freak power is going for $2/pint right now! Honestly, you would be hard-pressed to find a deal this good anywhere in Austin TX. It's a hefe and goes down easily, very easy to drink.  My personal fav is the convict hill oatmeal stout, coming in at 8% and tastes like coffee. Also very easy to drink and is a nice addition in \"wintertime.\"  Good place, fair prices, decent selection!"

I don't know how hidden it is, but the first time I came, I was skeptical because it is tucked behind some businesses and inside a warehouse. However, once we discovered this great, laid-back brewery, we visit it at least monthly.  Our favorite activity is Thursday night trivia with Geeks who Drink there. We've been a few times and it's always fun! They allow outside food, so it's always fun to pick up some bites and enjoy their awesome beer as we Geek it to random trivia.  I highly recommend, especially on a Thursday night! Hope to compete against you soon!"

Beers listed on the wall, not that many options here but still good beers.  One of the beers I wanted to try ran out so they recommended another based on that selection. Good job, I liked it.  It was a bit sour, so it hit the mark.  But the one I liked the most was the End Credit Chocolate Hazelnut Porter. The hazelnut makes it smooth, and the chocolate flavor comes through as well.    The staff was cordial, not overly friendly, but it's patrons sure are. They made room for us to walk up an order, they asked what I had ordered, and made recommendations based on what they had already tried.  They had live music that day too.  Very entertaining, good set, he even dedicated a song to one of my friends.  Very cool!  They have games like chutes and ladders, Rock Trivia, Oversized Jenga, and more.  Beer and entertainment, can't go wrong with that!"

With awesome craft beer, great hipster service and entertainment usually on the weekends you will have an awesome time. Try the beers on special, but also try the ones that are mixtures between two beers they are special and only unique to this establishment. The bathrooms are clean and there are snacks by the register, but be sure to eat before you get here since some beers are heavy and you might get full which really isn't a bad thing, but good to know!"

This is a great place for an afternoon drink or three.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Ask as many questions as you like regarding the beer choices.

I had to pick up my brother at the airport after, so I was looking for a place that was southeast, so Independence fit the bill. When I lived in Austin, I used to drink Independence beers all the time, but I never made it out to the brewery. I was impressed! It's really large! Tables inside and tables outside. They have several beers to choose from. The line for the bathroom was REALLY long, but we happened to choose a day that had an event (puppy adoptions I think) and it was PACKED. All in all, good beers, they were playing good music, and I had a great time with my friend! Great afternoon, and I'd go again!"

There seems to be good social distancing. There's hand sanitizer on the counter. Growlers are a possibility as are CDB sodas. The people are friendly and seem to know about the beer. I only discovered this place after the pandemic it started so I've never really spent time inside. But I've been sitting on my own porch enjoying it quite a bit and when things get back to normal I hope to spend a few hours at Adelbert's."

The neat thing is that they have artwork that's for sale on the walls. The art adds character and is a large variety of different themes all from local artists.   No good is served inside the brewery but there is a really good food truck on the outside.   The beers are amazing and you can sample before you buy.  Liked this brewery and beers are very creative."

They have a food truck outside with I think chicken I usually just get the fresh popped popcorn it's delicious and great to snack on while drinking beer. They have a Nintendo Wii with Mario kart and two old-school arcade games they also have a Foos ball table and darts. There's also boardgames that you can check out with giving them your ID, an awesome place to hang out with friends, kids and dogs!"

They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.  Definitely will return soon and bring my beer drinking friends."

Get the wristband if you're a first timer- only $15 for six \"half pours\" which are definitely more like 3/4 pours haha  The mango wit, naked nun, and hibiscus saison are AMAZINGGG.   Cool art, live music, food truck (although they left early, which sucked).  The only real disappointment? The brewery closes at 10- we coulda stayed all night!"

They've got a bunch of cool artwork from local artists, giant Jenga, a foosball table, and live music to keep you entertained.  They also have great food truck options during Taproom hours.    $14 for 6 half pours and a free pint glass is a pretty amazing deal, especially due to the quality and content of the beer.  If you're into light, crisper beers, try the Naked Nun or the Philosophizer.  If you like the darker stuff, the Black Rhino is your friend.  They also have some great sours!"

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

Also, what kind of brewery would this be if they did not have board games to play as you drink?  The Mango Wit is good and refreshing. Mango flavor is not as present as I like, but the hint of it is good enough."

                "description": "Hell yeah. A great local watering hole with a story, great ownership and service, and a more than fine beer selection. Local flavor at its finest.  Mike and Leslie used to run a construction equipment rental business out of this location. 2008 hit and they closed their doors in 2010. Years later after the family got into home brewing and good beer in general, they started over with a new business model: a local bar with an excellent beer selection - And wine, too. Local brews, too.  The building is awesome. Repurposed buildings like this make for some of the best bars and restaurants. It's gritty and has character. The decorations are cool. They have a smoking and non-smoking side. Cinder blocks and corrugated metal. The bar itself actually has some great wood and is well done. The patio is covered and was perfect for the family, including a play area for kiddos. (Mike and Leslie have a 3-year old grandson who needed a spot!) Nice breeze out back, too.  Good local hangout. Fun talking to Ron, a 20-year local and supporter of the bar. Funny - most of the locals were enjoying Bud and Whatever Light instead of the excellent draft selection. Hope they have enough demand to keep those great beers on draft! They've been open 2 years, so they're off to a great start. Mike and Leslie themselves work the bar, so you know you'll get great service.  Cheers, y'all!"

A rustic but clean establishment, it is definitely worth a stop in if you find yourself in the area. The staff is super friendly as well, bonus! Check out my pix for nice selection of drinking options.  Harley riders and bikers of all types should be adding this to their riding route."

Whether its your regular Bud Light, Lone Star or unique imported craft beers, the list of choices is impressive. The owner Mike is also the bartender, super laid back guy who knows his craft beers and wines (which he has 6 or 7 of on tap alongside 25 local craft brews.) The atmosphere of the bar is cozy, a little rustic with amazing artwork on the walls. By the way most of the art you will see there were done by Mike. If you haven't been to TAPZ you are missing out on a one of a kind place."

A little burst of crisp vinegar to cut the richness of the cheese is a bite of what I hope clouds would taste like.   We drive from San Antonio to eat here and you should too.

Sometimes when there's a new location, there's a drop in quality, but not here.   Its actually 2x bigger, nice and bright, just missing the Hip Hop Feel of the original location.   If you like BBQ or BBQ sandwiches, then this is the spot for you.   They gots a variety of meats for your meat eaters, sorry, I'm not a vegetarian so I don't know what they got for folks here.   The Nachos are awesome, prob best to share than eat alone.  If you don't know what you like, give the Trio Sampler a try, its a very nice place to start.   All the other sandwiches are massive (and good), and will prob put me in the hospital if I eats them again, so my goto sandwich is the McDowell, oh man, puts the McRib or any Pork Rib to shame, its executed so well.  Always tender fall off the bone rib mean between your choice of bun, bbq sauce, and pickles, so good.   The Sides are ok, but the Desert is the best, the OG cookie is so drip!   Give this place a try, its great!"

                "description": "We were looking for a BBQ lunch spot and SLAB delivers! The meats are smoked to perfection and because we couldn't decide on what to try we got two of the best sampler options on the menu - the slider trio (chicken, pork, brisket) and the epic DONK sammich (all the meats - chicken, pork, brisket, sausage and all the sauces). We also tried two of their sides because YOLO - Gouda Mac and the twice baked potato casserole. Legit, UNBELIEVABLY good. My favorite out of the slider trio was the chicken - sauces were on point, chicken was tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was EPIC - it's a wet Mac which I love. Super creamy, smoked Gouda is just divine. Twice baked tots were also good (but my heart belongs to the Mac). If you're here for epic then go with the DONK. Single portion was HUGE but it delivers on flavor! Stacked high with meats it's also smothered in delicious sauces, crunchy onions and jalapeños. Honestly, will come back for that! Beer selection is fantastic. Get you some SLAB!"

                "description": "This was among the worst barbecue we've tried in the region. Two sandwich combos plus tip was $50. We had a brisket+sausage sandwich and a pulled pork+mustard slaw sandwich, mac and cheese, and potato casserole.  Every dish was cold to lukewarm. Brisket and pork were both cold (some lukewarm bits), extremely dry, without flavor of their own, and severely under sauced. It helped when we asked for more sauce, but the meats were so dry that they soaked up moisture, and there was little flavor imparted. The smoked gouda mac and cheese was lukewarm, pure mush, and tasted like artificial smoke more than cheese. The twice baked potato casserole was just dry, grainy mashed potatoes. The mustard slaw had spice-heat but no flavor.  I couldn't finish my cold meal so I boxed it up and took it home, while my friend forced herself enough to be full and toss the rest. Once home I reheated it in a skillet and added more of the red sauce I'd requested, and then everything just tasted like sugar.   Disappointing."

Family friendly spot (a kids play area with kitchen and all!!),good music playlist and eventually some live music. They just have snacks right now but eventually said they'll have a menu. Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

Their guacamole and tacos were good and so was their beer selection. I honestly don't remember which one we got, but just had whatever the servers recommended and they were all good.  The outdoor seating area was nice at night with the hanging lights and is dog friendly (always a bonus for us!).   Street parking is close to impossible to find in the area, but there's paid garage parking. It is pricey, but the only spot we were able to find that wasn't too far from Lazarus."

                "description": "Thursday late afternoon - stopped by here to check out yet another brewery on the street. Mostly packed with people working on laptops, but the open air setup doesn't make it feel too crowded.  Was able to quickly get a seat at the bar and order from the scannable menus. Decided on the Prodigal Pills ($6) to go along with a Breakfast Taco ($3.50). Pilsener is light and crushable, though not much flavor. Breakfast taco comes out fast - packed with eggs, cheese, pico de gallo, and bacon. Thankfully not a stale tortilla and even balance of ingredients. Finished the day off with the Double Predestination IPA ($7)- definitely more of a kick, possible some overkill on the hops.   Service is a bit hectic as the bartenders work off the many tables. Fine spot to relax, especially outside where there are tables available."

I got a Disco Prophet, a strawberry lemonade sour, and a Big Sky IPA - delicious and refreshing.  But the real star was the appetizers. We got chips and fresh guacamole, which paired excellently with the beer. But the real winner was the fried chickpeas, which were like seasoned corn nuts! I've never had anything like that, and it's enough for 3-4 people to share, despite only being $3.  The place was clean, staff was friendly, and there was plenty of seating. Definitely a must-see brewery if you're in the area."

Showed up on a Thursday evening for dinner and was impressed with the amount of people who were here. There is picnic table seating out back with tents in the front for additional seating. There is also plenty of seating inside. There is plenty of seating but the like to order may take some time to get through, so plan accordingly.   I went with the torta as my meal. The bread was authentic and the fillings inside were great. If I had to change one thing I would have asked to get the torta with chorizo although it isn't listed as a protein for the sandwich.   This is a great local spot to check out and a place I will most likely be a regular at."

                "description": "This place has plenty of outdoor seating with fans that keep the flies at bay mostly. The inside was nice and they have everything you'd need to hit the spot. Tacos and beer.   The beer was pretty good. The only sour beer they had at the time was a Rosé flavored one that unfortunately tasted a little too much like wine, but was still digestible. My hazy IPA was not hazy at all, but was still fine. I wish the beers were served a bit colder.   The fried chickpeas were a good deal for $3 we thought they could serve like 10 people. The 2 of us only made a dent in like 1/5 of the bowl. But hey, they're snacky so maybe someone could down the whole thing if they really wanted to!  The carnitas taco was really good. I highly recommend it. The al pastor was alright but didn't pack the flavor punch of the carnitas. I doused my tacos in the free salsa that was in a mini fridge nearby. The red salsa was so good and added a layer of light smokiness to my tacos. But then after a while I thought I sensed some heat? I assumed it was the green salsa so I continued to douse my tacos in the red. Idk it must have been the red salsa that was hot, because by the end of my meal I was feeling sick to my stomach. Never felt that way from spice but needless to say the beer didn't taste too good after that either. Luckily I recuperated by sipping 2 glasses of their Yeti water until I didn't want to vomit anymore.   I can't place my distaste after this meal on the restaurant since it was mostly my own doing . I assume they label their salsas and I just didn't see it."

I went with my favorite kind which is a stout on nitro.  I hate wasting beer but I drank just half.  Not only were the beers not flavorful but they were not cold.    I will say their tacos were really good, and the place is super huge.  For a Monday it was pretty packed at lunch, but still spacious enough to stay 6-feet away if desired.  It's not hard to find a seat bc the place is sooo big.    Wouldn't come back for the beer, but for the tacos?  Yaaassss!"

                "description": "Hands down the best brewery experience we encountered in Austin. It's a little bit if everything and that's not at all a bad thing as without exception they are all done well. We saw they were open early so we went in on a weekday thinking we could knock this off our list of a full day planned. We weren't real clear on their hours entailed so there was a not so unwelcome idea of a little day / morning drinking to get the day started. We realized this was going to leave us with the opportunity to have a few small samples or perhaps one nice pour. Upon our arrival we were impressed at how the location spanned the corner of the street and had many \"compartments\" of seating areas. I'm no way were Amy of them on the smaller side. Street parking was easy enough and we headed on in.   Very impressed to be greeted with smiling faces along with plenty of good morning exchanges. We were very pleasantly surprised to see they offered an array of espresso drinks. What a welcome pivot to our plan. We ordered up and came to realize they had food as well. Pretty happy about that. There were the assorted pastry items and breakfast TACOS! I noticed there was also queso fondido on the menu and that was screaming please try me. I went to order and was told this item is generally served later in the day. I suspect my sadness to hear this news showed as there was a quick offer to fire up the required kitchen equipment to make this happen (the salamander for those curious).   The lattes were delicious. So much so we ordered up a second round. Near completion of those the awesome cheesy chorizo goodness arrived. Bubbly hot and looking superb. It was all I could do to keep myself from grabbing a chip and putting a scoop of this bubbling sub nuclear cheese in my mouth at the price of completely burning my entire mouth. With a little patience I snuck a few small bites being mindful to blow as to not scorch my mouth. OMG was this delicious in every aspect.   Right away we knew this was just fine with a latte but was screaming for a beer to accompany this perfect breakfast fast. Such an awesome selection of beers. The bartender was beyond sweet and gave us many short pull samples of the tappers. I landed on the one that worked for me. My wife found one that worked well for her. By the time the beers arrived it was clear this was not going to be a short stop. Instead it was clear this was our impromptu plan for the morning. Completely five star experience from the word go. So much so we took the liberty of an evening stop later that week. The vibe of this place was so cool with any hint of pretentiousness. I'm no expert on all the brew options in Austin but this was clearly number one for us based on all it included and the absolute outstanding hospitality from the coffee bar to the bartender to the cook who brought us the miraculously amazing queso. No matter you plans I would highly suggest  in fact nearly insist this is a stop not to be missed. This reviews has been locked in draft land fir a while but there is no doubt this place is still thriving and for all the right reasons."

Instead of leading us to a new table or area, once we sat the staff told us we had to leave or we could stand outside in the 40* weather. We got our beers and were standing off to the side and the cashier told us move out of the way so people can order- we weren't in the way, people were not ordering. While I'm writing this we are witnessing more customers treated poorly in the line. Seems like a lot of non-Texans are working here and it shows. Never will I ever come back to this establishment.

This has quickly become one of my favorite spots in Austin- whether you're there for coffee and tacos in the morning or high quality brews at night, you really can't go wrong at Lazarus.   I showed up on a Saturday afternoon and ended up staying until after dinner! The ambiance is fantastic- with ample seating both indoors and outdoors and picnic tables for groups of all sizes, Lazarus attracts all kinds, from people working from home to big parties.   The tacos were really great! We ordered the pollo verde and al pastor tacos and they were fantastic. They were a great portion to pair with drinks and while the line seemed long the service was really quick.   Overall, this is a great spot for regulars and I've found myself returning for a reliably good time."

                "description": "This place is awesome and maybe a little too family friendly.   So 5 soul owns all the property that the brewery is also on. When we went there, they had 2 food trucks. One did pizza and salads and the other hamburgers and other food.   Inside of 5 souls is wicked cool.  We tried many of the red wine and they were alright.    The staff is super friendly and patient.  They also have non alcoholic  daiquiri  for the kids. Just a few flavors, but the kids enjoyed them. Of course they did they are just like smaller but more expensive Slushies.   The wine itself is pretty good and a tad on the pricey side IMO. $12/glass or $36 per bottle. But the atmosphere is so darn cool. It's probably one our favorite places to go to right now. Unfortunately or maybe fortunately they are an hour away."

                "description": "5 Soul is easily one of the coolest wine bars and tasting rooms I have ever been to. Co-located at the same address on Bob Wire Road as Frontyard Brewing, this facility is an impressive one. Their tasting room had lots of space - both indoors and out.   The indoor space was open and airy with tons of natural light from floor to ceiling windows and a modern interior. The service here is also a highlight as we noticed that everyone = the servers, bar managers and the owners were ALL making sure that everyone's experience was top notch. We found them to all be very friendly and personable - like those cool neighbors that you REALLY want to hang out with. One thing I liked is that this tasting room also had great energy to it - something that is missing from a LOT of tasting rooms and even some breweries.   Outside, the covered patio is large with plenty of seating for friends, families. The yard is extensive - an amazing space to bring your kiddos and just let them play and have fun.  This really is the kind of place that you wish was only 5 minutes (and not 45) from your house - so check them out."

The founder of the winery, Madelyn, visited our table and we chatted for quite a while. Great plans for the future! Our meal was incredible. One person in our party said it was the best meal  she has ever had. That is quite a statement! We asked to see the chef.  Executive Chef Shawn graciously accepted our kudos and applause. We walked the property and will always remember the great experience and fabulous property views. Well done!"

                "description": "My daughter gave me the gift of her time, along with a 3-course meal and wine tasting, to honor a special occasion. We decided to make this a weekday outing, to minimize traffic and the possibility of large groups being at the winery.  We were promptly greeted and seated upon arrival. The dining room was largely empty, and we had superb service. This was our second visit to the winery, and we plan to return.   We tasted 7 wines in all, 3 of which were paired with the November menu of panzanella (a bread salad), fennel-crusted pork tenderloin, and cannoli. The wine pairings were excellent.   We were not big fans of the panzanella. It seemed to need additional ingredients to make it more interesting and less dry. The main course, however, was fabulous. The pork medallions were crusty and flavorful. The linguine accompaniment was wonderfully garlicky, making it almost possible to ignore that the pasta was overcooked. And the cannoli was excellent. I think of cannoli as a finger food; these mini cannoli were made pretty with their presentation but more messy to eat because of the chocolate sauce. The cannoli were served with a very good port wine.   All in all, we had a very nice meal and enjoyed the wines... which we drank. No spitting for us! We are not connoisseurs, but certainly enjoy good quality wine. Some of Flat Creek's are very good indeed.   This was not a cheap excursion, but the 2 hours we spent there were worth it. This would be a great place for a romantic date, and also worked well as a mother-daughter excursion. Flat Creek has other dining options that include pizza, and there's a disc golf course on the premises. Do make advance reservations for your visit, as this isn't a large establishment and can be a long (but pretty) drive from the Austin area."

In addition your apology seems very condescending and not genuine at all.  How do you know that what we were envisioning? We just wanted to have a nice time with our grands, and we were talked down to, and you're still talking down to us...."

My girlfriend and I made our first trip to Marble falls this past weekend and are very happy to say we started the weekend off here at Flat Creek Estate.   We enjoyed the \"Chef's 3 course experience\" which was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had! 6 glasses of wine and a 3 course meal that took us on a  flavorful journey. At one point we felt like Remy in that scene from Ratatouille, the one where he pairs the strawberry with some cheese and feels fireworks... yes, it was really that good!  Carmen was a priceless part of the already amazing experience, she was so friendly, enthusiastic and helpful! Ask for her to be your server if you can!  We can't wait to come back to marble falls and visit here again, looking forward to next seasons wines and Chef's 3-course! Thank you guys!"

                "description": "It hurts me to write this review. We truly want every small business to thrive. My family and I went to the Vineyard on a Friday afternoon for an intimate celebration of my husband's birthday with our mom, dad and children, it ended in my 5-year old little one being verbally attacked by a man in the pavilion, who identified himself as 'the owner'.   We decided to try the disc golf course, and we loved our experience with Casey, he is a gem! Very knowledgeable about disc golf, and very accommodating. We let him and Madelyn (the owner's wife) know we were celebrating a birthday. The course was fun, but ridden with fire ants, red ants, sticker burs and bull nettle. It was not the polished experience we were expecting. But still fun for our family.   We finished disc golf, and returned to the pavilion around 6:00pm.  We ordered a large dinner, but since we were not offered to sit in the main seating area, we sat under the outdoor pavilion. We were in the pavilion for less than 5 minutes, and the adults arranged tables so our family could sit together (there is no waiter in the pavilion so we had to move tables on our own). During those few minutes my two small children were playing under the pavilion, not causing any harm or damage, just laughing and trotting around like kids do outside (he is 5 and she is 7).   Out of no where a man started verbally attacking my 5-year old. This man who looked to be in his 70s, was sitting at a table drinking bottles of wine with 2 other people. He continued to yell at the top of his lungs scaring me and my babies. They came running to me asking me why the man was yelling and whistling at them. It broke my heart. A complete stranger was attacking them for no apparent reason.   After protecting them, my dad and husband approached the man who was yelling the obscenities. This is when he identified himself as 'the owner'. He told us our children were 'out of control' and we needed to get them under control. I asked them what they were doing to display out of control behavior, and he didn't say a thing, besides he had guests with him and they were disrupting his evening. My father let the man know if we were going to be patrons of his business, we would not tolerate his verbal abuse of our 5 and 7 year old children. My father also told him, \"We don't yell at our kids like that and if he had a problem with the way our children were behaving he could have stood up and walked over while we were arranging our own tables and told us in a normal tone of voice the problem he saw.\"  After the incident, the man sat at his table continuing to drink wine for 45 minutes, and sadly never came back to our table to apologize to our children for scaring them because of his obscene behavior. As we left, both of my children continued to asked why he was so angry.   We now understand this pavilion is in 'the owners' front yard. On this evening Rick (the owner) had been drinking with friends and our family was interrupting their evening. His behavior not only made us feel the most unwelcome as paying customers, but was abusive and completely out of control, especially as 'the owner'.  We should have been able to have this conversation with the business owner. Unfortunately, he left the pavilion to go back to his house, and did not return or offer an apology.  ***Update in Response to Owners Apology Below***  Your apology ends with 'resolve any confusion or fears the children had regarding why they were reprimanded'. The main point of why this experience was so horrifying: No one should ever reprimand a 5-year old child, except that child's guardians. If there was an issue with a child's safety, that concern should have been directed to the guardians who were standing between the children and the owner. Never should a stranger, much less a 70-year old man who is consuming alcohol ever 'reprimand' a child, ever! Of course of case the outcome was severe harm to the child, in this case, our 5-year old was not in severe danger.  Regarding the excuse that you 'witnessed dangerous behavior, and you had to immediately intervene': If there are components of your business that are dangerous to patrons, you should immediately remove these hazards, so that they don't become a safety issue. If you feel your deck boxes are not safe, you should store them in a storage facility where patrons do not have access.   Regarding your comment that 'you wish to leave discipling to parents but are forced to intervene when there is a safety concern': We were a party of 4 adults, and we were less than 10 feet away from our children. While we were bussing our own tables and arranging furniture, we were not aware my 5- year old sat on the 'deck box' and got down by jumping off. This type of 'danger' (i.e. sitting on a sitting area, and jumping off something that is no more than 2 feet off the ground) should not elicit the response of 'discipline' by a stranger, or 'immediate' intervention."

We started with wine tasting followed by a spectacular wine pairing with each course. We hadn't really considered Texas wine as equivalent to Calif wines but we were wrong. All of the wines we sampled were great and because of that we ended up heading home with 14 bottles! The owner even stopped by to ask us about our experience which we gladly shared. Definitely worth experiencing this adventure."

The inside seating was small and very loud so we chose to sit outside.  There was only one guy taking orders.  He was very nice and tried his best.  But, he needed help. My husband and I each chose wine tasting (we got 4 samples, but we didn't get to choose what we wanted to try), a glass of wine, and a pizza. We got our wine tasting and glass of wine immediately. We waited about 45 minutes before we got our pizza.  The pizza was delicious, but our wine was already gone.  Probably will not go back."

Beautiful location and building. Plenty of parking.   Inside tables by reservation only. Nicely separated, no issues being close to other guests. Not the same for reception or table service.  Server was pleasant, but had zero concept of social distancing, no mask and was right in our faces each time we had an interaction.   Menu/tasting a little confusing. Basically you prepay $40 each and get whatever you want from the menu, including wine to drink there or to go. Most wines were available for tasting pours, but not all. Some wines good, some not so much. Liked the primitivo the most of the many we tried.   Very nice for the setting and service. Great set up for limited capacity, but they really need to work on wait staff protection."

During a weekend getaway to the Marble Fallas area from Dallas, we planned a day of wineries in Hill Country and Flat Creek was at the top of our list based on recommendations from friends. We wanted to experience the 3-course lunch but due to social distancing rules, reservations were hard to come by. We figured we'd take our chances and arrive as soon as they opened, and we were in lunch! We were able to be seated indoors right away by Madeleine who was just a delight! There was just one other party enjoying lunch, so we felt very catered to. Our server, David was also wonderful.  Even after our lunch, Madeleine brought us over to the outdoor patio area and gave us a couple of complimentary tastings of her a few of her fave white wines.  Hands down, our best winery experience. We bought two bottles and will be back soon!"

                "description": "We have been members at Flat Creek Estate for several years now and have been very pleased with their many offerings. However this past Friday, the owner and staff went way over and above! Our son wanted to propose to his girlfriend and he wanted it to be a surprise! She loves pizza and wine so we \"planned\" that day to have a late lunch at the winery. It had been inclement out the previous few days and the day of the weather was looking iffy. The staff worked with us on a variety of scenarios just in case. The afternoon turned up sunny and warm! We were to \"meet up\" them a little later so they headed to the winery for lunch. The chef made a heart-shaped pizza (one of the surprises) and the staff came up with the idea of putting the ring into a small to-go box so he could bring it to the table without her knowing. I had also dropped off a bouquet of flowers for staff to bring out after he had proposed to her. The photographer found a great vantage point, the pizza was made, he picked it up along with the ring, he set the pizza down on the table and opened it, got on his knee and proposed to her! After she said yes and they hugged and cried a bit, the staff brought out the bouquet, we showed up and the photographer took more photos, onlookers awww'd and cheered! It was really an over and above day for everyone working at Flat Creek Estate! Thank you for helping to make my son's proposal so special!"

Flat Creek is a special place for us as we saw the sign for it during our Miata club drive back in 2007. I contacted them a few days later, set up a tasting for the club, a bunch of us drove out there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The vineyard itself and the architecture are fantastic, and it has grown a lot since they opened.   Everyone who works there is extremely friendly and helpful, the food was always tasty, they have a lot of fun events, and the wines are truly delicious.   We enjoyed it so much that we kept going back, became friends with the owners, and got married there in 2011. Flat Creek was very accommodating as we wanted it to be on a specific date that was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and they made it work.  Our wedding video showcases the vineyard extremely well so if you want to watch it, you can click here. https://vimeo.com/34645652 We are biased of course, but our friend did an amazing job on it and we love to revisit it."

No more running up too ATX, San Marcos, or SA to try great, local, craft beer.  By local, they really mean it. They are trying to get brews that are local to the Buda area. And while they may carry a tap or two from breweries in Austin/SA, they really want to spotlight breweries that are not Austin or SA based, really defining \"drink local.\"   We went during their soft opening and they had a steady, if not busy stream of customers, which all managed to get served timely and had their questions answered (some customers were new to the craft beer scene).  Really look forward to coming back here and setting their additions (outdoor seating).  No food as of yet but you can bring your own or call it in (pro tip: there's a Papa John's next door and a Thai restaurant a block away)  Looking forward to many more pints at this new hang out spot in the 78610."

Large space with both inside and outdoor seating as well as a food truck parked to the side.  Decided to try a couple beers: Marco IPA ($6) and Friends with Benefits ($7). The Marco is well balanced but still had plenty of hops. Friends with benefits is more on the hazy side that sticks with you. The latter paired just fine alongside one of the sandwiches from the food truck.  Service was quick as there weren't many people at the brewery yet. A couple hours later the spot was packed, so best to come early."

Their indoor taproom is closed and they are adhering to the social distancing guidelines. We had a large picnic table to ourselves and were very comfortable chilling out on a breezy Sat afternoon.   I really enjoyed their Lazy Daisy Hazy IPA. It's a wonderful IPA that has a hint of sweetness and a citrus finish. Plus 1 gave 5 stars to their LA Beer American Pilsner. This is a typical Pils that drinks lite and is a perfect brew for a warm day.   Hungry? Spicy Boys Chicken food truck is onsite and is producing wonderful spicy chicken (Duh). They offer a range of sauces from sweet to hot as hades. We went midrange spicy and felt the heat.   Not a beer drinker, they offer wine, water, soft drinks, and surprise a frose' .  Solid 5-stars!"

The bar staff is friendly and accommodating and there is plenty of seating from couches to regular tables. If you're going to be there for a while drinking be prepared for a hefty bill as nothing is inexpensive here. The awesome lake view helps to ease the $$ pain though. This place lends to awesome people watching as well since this area is a big tourist draw, so overall you can't really go wrong by stopping in here for a weekend libation."

I wasn't greeted by anyone because you have to go up to the bar to order, which is pleasant for my kind of personality. They have very loud music to fit the vibe of the room and plenty of places to sit! Most importantly was the food; I was absolutely amazed by it and it was so delicious! I ordered the sisig and it was the best thing I ever had. I also, ordered a side of Caesar salad, but this was no ordinary piece of salad. It was presented gracefully and tasted extraordinary. The staff is very kind and fast paced with receiving orders. I am very glad that I came to this restaurant and hope I can revisit this place in the future!"

The brewery does not have an actual taproom open regularly, but instead is open only Saturdays from 12-4 pm in their parking lot. I went during their anniversary event and it was $25 for a glass that you keep and 6 8 oz pours of your choice (you can do 12 4 oz pours instead). Majority of the pours turned out to be larger than 8 oz so you can really get trashed here. They had 44 beers on tap. Pretty insane. Unfortunately, none of the beers were that great. They had like 4 food trucks and a lot of porta potties (lines can get long).   Overall, this was a quantity over quality brewery. We had 4 people in our group and none of us were impressed, although, we are from California and are spoiled by all of the good breweries out here. If you just want to get the job done and get trashed on a Saturday afternoon, this is your spot. If your a real beer lover, you may be disappointed"

Maybe it's an exclusivity thing...it sure works. If you are visiting Austin and have a free Saturday early afternoon, be sure to hit up 512 for your beer desires. You can take your tasting cup home as a souvenir. They have outdoor seating, merch for purch, and are kid and dog-friendly. Double wow! My boyfriend and I made it to 512 at the tail end of their Saturday hours, but we were able to share a tasting for one. That was perfect because it was the safest way to drink, play some ladderball (it was my first time playing that!), and drive to dinner afterwards.  They have clean restrooms and an easy way to purchase your guitar picks as proof of beer-drinking capability. When you park (plenty of parking btw), walk first to the door on the tasting room's left. You can purchase your tasting power, then head over to the main room for the adventure. When we went, there was basically one taptender pouring while a barback was helping him out with the glasses and stuff. It seemed like a lot of regulars were there, mostly 30+ in age, but all having a great time socializing. There wasn't a food truck there, nor any food on site, so bring your own or head out to eat afterwards."

You get to taste 6 full glass beers or 12 half glass beers and can pick if you want them to pour half a glass or full glass. The beer list was extensive! There were probably 2 beers we really liked and tons of unique ones that were puzzling to us. They also served some complimentary cheeses. There's also a few food trucks for hungry people.

Had an IPA. Very tasty. I like. Me, happy camper. 512 Brewing Company taproom mostly outside. Ugh... You buy your beer and hang outside in beer garden. Very unique way to order beer. Buy tokens (12 for $24) at one location. Then walk to beer taps. Ugh... They give you two 8oz glasses. Yeah... Never a fresh clean glass to try delicious beer. This is a comfort I like in a taproom I feel it makes a big difference in flavor and service. My two cents. I have only had their IPA. I am an IPA guy. I like the classic flavors and full body beer. 512 Brewing Company IPA does a good job for me. I would like the tasting experience as an option. I really enjoy a 4oz sample to try all the beers. Not a fan of using my beer token on a maybe. Oh well. 512 Brewing Company I will be back just not that often..."

I grew to loathe the environment.  Every time I'd toss something in the blue bin at work I'd scowl.  It just wasn't worth it.  I wanted this beer in something other than a keg.  Low and behold on my last trip in I see a stack of 4-packs of Pecan Porter.  The most perfect stack since the pyramids.  Beer guy saw me and came over to share in my unbridled joy.  I cursed the owner one last time for making me wait so long.  And grabbed two."

                "description": "512 had the honors of providing me with my first brewery tour. It was great, but definitely a little different than I expected. I attended the first weekend where they changed their \"style\" of the tour. They have not updated their website to list the correct details. Admission is $12 per person. This gets you the tour (optional), a small 512 glass souvenir for tasting, and 6 tickets for beer tasting.   The tour is said to start Saturday's around noon. However once you arrive, they will let you know how long they are going to wait based on the amount of people waiting. (they like to fill up)  That being said, we had about an hour wait outside on the patio-ish area (no cover, bring a hat and shades) to enjoy some brews! The weather was great and they have giant Jenga and corn hole for you to enjoy. Dogs are also welcome outside. If you plan to skip out on the tour and just enjoy the beer, bring lawn chairs as the tables get crowded after a while.   IF you decide to attend their tour, keep in mind that it may not be exactly what you expect. The brewery is small and there are only about 3 sections to view in cramped spaces. Get up close to the tour guide so that you can hear because they do not use a microphone. They have some work do to on the tour, but overall I enjoyed it.  Stop by 512! Besides, you can't beat $12 for 6 beers!"

For $12 you get an 8oz 512 glass to keep and 6 guitar pics to trade for different brews. There beers were all great, we even got to try some limited edition that's not being distributed yet. The \"bartender\" was really cool, knowledgeable about the beers, and overall pleasant to talk to. The only thing missing would be some type of food truck or snack.   Definitely give this place a try if you are a beer lover!"

You purchase a very small glass for $12 but you also get 6 guitar piks that you trade in for refills on the beer so actually a great deal!

There was beer for the whole family and the outdoor seating area came complete with bags, jenga, and ladder toss. The cost is $12 for 6-8oz beer samples! Probably the best deal in town. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to hangout with friends. I'd recommend bringing food with you as there isn't much close by, but otherwise great place to just go and chill."

                "description": "It's pretty rare that I like MOST of the beers at a brewery. Usually there's one or two stand outs, and that in itself is unusual.   However, 512 takes the cake on my brewery tour of Austin this time around. We showed up around noon, definitely past their \"tour\" time and it wasn't even available on their eventbrite / website anymore. Regardless, the brewer (New-ish Guy, woo!) let us in the tour and filled our two glasses with delicious Pecan Porter that was on nitro at the time.  I definitely loved their IPAs (IPA and Seven), their Wit was also not bad at all. The only thing I was a little eh about was their Pils and that's ok with me. They were incredibly knowledgable, the tour was fun, and they're doing some really cool barrel aged stuff that you don't see at a lot of breweries. They're also very dedicated to self distribution, despite how difficult that seems, so I'm definitely looking forward to other 512 beers I can get my hands on in the future."

We were both disappointed and decided to find a place to eat to salvage the night. That's where AquaBrew came in. The environment of AB is warm and comfortable. The service is nice, attentive, and happy. And the food and beer...  My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork sandwich- the spicy slaw was delish. Both were really tasty and hot, fries were crispy and salty. The IPAs were delicious with the food.  Definitely looking forward to the next chance I have to go back."

When we walked in we were very disappointed in their craft selection. I had researched this prior to choosing to go there based on their craft choices showed online. Again, something else that needed to be updated. Also, they aren't serving food. There was a large dog walking around that would come right up to you or sneak up under the tables and lick your feet. I like dogs so it was ok but for someone that doesn't..... Would not go back here until they get fully moved or opened."

                "description": "They've thought about everything at this brewery.  Great food, live music, seating inside, outside, and UPSTAIRS on the deck!  When the weather is right, they have the big glass garage doors open.  Yeah, they brew their own beer here and they have a decent selection.  It's not your typical brewery where you can just stroll in and choose the table you want to sit at.  That's because they have full table service for food and drinks.  I prefer breweries that let you wander around from the bar, to an outside table, to an inside table, and then back again - you know, rinse, lather, and repeat (relaxed and unstructured - I need that once in a while).  If you just want to stop in for a quick beer, you can sit at the bar.  The bar is quite large but also very popular with the college crowd, so it's hard to get a seat at times.   Now to the serious stuff - the beer!  I've had their Kolsch (San Marcos Blonde) and their Vienna Lager.  The blonde was the run of the mill Kolsch, not bad by any means, but the Vienna Lager - wow!  It had a great malty taste to it.  I liked it so much that I purchased a crowler of it to take home.  I rarely do that, so that tells you it must be good.  Enough useless banter - here's everything else you need to know about this place:  Free parking lot right next door or free 2 hr street parking.   Patio areas in the front and the back with overhead infrared heaters and fans with misters (they have both Texas seasons covered).  This place is popular with the college kids - TOO popular.  Growler refills are $12 or $18 for 64 oz, and $24 or $36 for 128 oz, depending on the beer you select.    Crowlers to go:  $8 or $10 (depending on the beer).  You can get three for $20 or $25 (depending on the beer).  Plenty of food options.   And I almost forgot to tell you - they have a FULL bar, not just beer!"

                "description": "Aquabrew is definitely a gem in San Marcos. I learned about it through the purchase of the brewery tour on Groupon. The tour was quaint because it's not that big, but very interesting.  The gentleman who gave the tour seemed a bit rushed at the end, but he answered our questions and seemed very knowledgeable.   At the end of the tour we got to sample some beer. They also have a beer club where you buy a growler, we got the one for $100, and join their beer club. You get a punch card for 10 refills on the growler. My husband and I got one each for $200. I was thinking it an \"okay\" deal i guess. Truthfully I wasn't that thrilled cause of the price. But OMG!!!! IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY FOLKS!!!!.   Aquabrew has some of the best beers around. I am Army and have lived and traveled all over the world and this lil place holds its ground when it comes to beers! Purchasing the growler is the best deal too.   I have not had the food yet, but the place is always busy and people seem to love it. And they have some of the cutest guys behind the bar.  In all, I give this gem an A+"

This place really has a community feel with longer style tables and an incredible open patio with fans and lighting, ping pong and live music... and of course... beer.  The food was very flavorful. Thai chicken had good spice and the chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The Margarita flatbread was fresh tasting. The arugula salad was huge and bursting with fruits and flavor.  The beer was excellent and just what you'd expect from an onsite brewery.   Overall, if you're looking for a fun place for you and your peeps to chill, eat and drink in San Marcos... you'd do well to try this place. Plus it's right up the street from the Cheetham St warehouse."

Long tables instead of individual tables to encourage people to meet new people ! Which is a really awesome concept . Also there's a large bar since it's also a brewery.  Food- my food was about a 3.5/5 , but my friends was a solid 1. Her salmon Benedict had almost uncuttable biscuit since it was so hard , and the most burnt potatoes I've ever seen. My food which was the stuffed French toast was pretty yummy, but not a lot to it.  Noise level - 1/5 THE BAND WAS SOOO LOUD.

As a table, we ordered the: a) Brew House Pretzel - Amazingly soft and the beer queso is a great pairing  b) AB Bacon Jam Fries - HOLY! The bacon jam itself is something I've never had before and I must say this makes it a must return for me  c) Glass of Imperial Pilsner - Smooth and pretty standard for a Pilsner  d) Glass of Artificial Intelligence Tripel (9.72% ABV) - Yeah...the ABV tells the story itself  This spot has a great atmosphere, very rustic and cozy. Definitely a nice place, just wish you could order directly from the bar for faster access to beer."

The Yelp reviews of this place kind of remind me of that. It's not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.  The highlight of my meal was the Mosaic IPA. Balanced and drinkable, this beer was really enjoyable. I also tried the Swine Dive IPA. The taste of this was a little too clean for an IPA and just didn't have the hoppy depth to add to its character. Not bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall the food I ordered was really lackluster. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't a memorable meal. My chicken empanadas were oily, and had very little chicken in the filling. The whole thing struck me as more of acorn dog egg roll hybrid, and didn't really seem like an empanada at all. I was grateful for the spicy sauce it was served with, which was pretty tasty. I also ordered the brussel sprouts. There were some decent flavors here, but I would have really preferred them to have a little more char on them. They came across as slightly undercooked and worse yet, very wet. A little crispness would have gone a long way.  Service was fair, friendly enough but really on the slow side. It took me almost a half an hour to get my food and it wasn't crowded. The couple at the bar sitting next to me ordered hamburgers. I have to admit I was a little jealous because they looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe it was a bad night. Whatever the reason I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

Lacked flavor. Sticky rice instead of the delish potatoes and only green beans instead of a mix of seasonal veggies. Hubby had the tostadas and 'meh' reaction. Will give it one more try before relegating it to happy hour only place with 3 stars. So sad."

That portion of the night really sucked.  Howeverrrr, the street corn, queso, crispy tuna, edamame, and loaded fried were reallyyyy good. We especially loved the street corn. I wish we would've gotten the delicious food on time, instead of having to remind the staff multiple times butttt at least it tasted amazing??   I can't give them more stars even though the food was great because service is so so so important."

                "description": "Just left after lunch. Cute/hip spot with friendly staff.   We ordered the AB burger and I did an upgrade to their bacon jam fries ($4 upgrade). I was so excited to try these fries but they were very underwhelming to me. $4 is steep for an up charge but had I enjoyed them I wouldn't have minded. The burger was the best bite on the table. It was small in size but very juicy and tasty. Not one to split.   Next up was the fried chicken and eggs. It has so many things I typically like - fried chicken, cream gravy, bacon jam, eggs, but I didn't like this dish. It lacked dimension of flavor. It needed something. The herbed fries that came with it were good. I liked them better than the $4 bacon jam ones.   Our kids split the stuffed French toast. The only ate a little bit because it was too sweet. If a kid thinks something is too sweet you know it's toooooo sweet. Neither ate it. It was a waste of money.   Overall I'm glad we tried it but don't need to return on our own accord."

We saw a guy walk from the kitchen with a bottle of what looked like vodka and went outside to their outside area and was playing around.   The food was DELICIOUS!! My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork sandwich. He for regular fries for his side and i got a sweet potato. We weren't a fan of the regular fries, so I highly recommend the sweet potato.   We also ordered the mimosa flight and were kinda impressed. For $20 you get a whole bottle of champagne and 4 different flavor options. We chose chipotle pineapple, watermelon, passion fruit and lavender. All amazing.   This place is spacious. The food is amazing. I was just unimpressed with a few waitstaff/bar staff members. We went next door to Chances afterwards and they mentioned the management has gone down hill.   I hadn't mentioned we aren't from the area. We are from Austin. This place had stellar food and for a night shift it wasn't awful. Give them a shot!!"

My husband followed it up with the classic Good, Bad and Ugly, a pepperoni, sausage, and pepper pizza that was elevated by higher quality ingredients. I tried the mushroom pizza, which was tasty as long as you're looking for something different. An umami bomb with a mushroom purée sauce, speck ham, and rosemary.  Two pizzas + the cauliflower = 2.5 meals for us, so plan for generous portions/leftovers."

No one told us that market is only open on Sunday and it was Saturday. Ha!  So we tried this place out in their dog-friendly  backyard covered patio and we were not disappointed!  - Fresh craft quality cocktails on draft  - Super fresh ingredients in the salad and pizza  It was still pretty early so we had the breakfast brunch pie and a light fennel salad and it hit the spot perfectly. When you visit, you can order straight from the bar and Emilio will happily take care of you."

I don't care for the clam offering, but it's hard to choose a favorite among the others. I guess I'd have to give a slight nod to the 'Nduja Sausage though. Regardless of which pie you choose, the crust isn't just an obligatory substrate; it's got great flavor and texture.  The cocktails are outstanding, especially the prickly pear margarita. Sunday is Bloody Mary day, and you won't find a better one outside of the next one. The mix has got just the right amount of spice and it's filled with a skewer containing salami, pepperoni, an olive, a tomato, basil and mozzarella.  The owners and staff are great, and they recently remodeled an already great patio area to include a beer garden with 30 beers on tap."

I love the music they play there as well. It is very low-key so if you feel like just sitting down and having a couple beers in talking with the regulars it is perfect perfect"

Very interesting pieces. But enough about that.  This place is loaded with craft beer from Texas. Texas is apparently pretty big in that regard (and nearly every other regard). For a place as small and intimate as it is, there's a lot of seating packed in it and even some outdoor seating. There's games, lots of games. Card games, board games, darts, pool, and sometimes even a live DJ.  If you dig the craft brew scene this place is surely right up your alley. If you find yourself in San Marcos come check em out!"

The staff is friendly and can also help me decide what to order if I'm unsure. I've had fun trying to new beers and discovering what have become my go-to selections. (Bonus : All the beer they serve is from Texas!) Between the mix of good people and good beer - this has become my favorite bar."

They have all Texas craft beers, 28 on tap, fresh, and they even have a few selections in cans and some wine!      I was shocked when I saw they had The Infinite Monkey Theorem Rose' ....impressive.   The vibe is awesome. Super laid back, chill, artsy, and hipster. Loves it.       The owners are lovely people. So nice, great service, and very informative on every single beer. They make it their priority to get the perfect beer for you.   They have some savory oyster crackers for you to enjoy while you booze it up. Cards Against Humanity is also available to play for free!        The decor was my favorite. I was super into the refurbished wooden pallets, the art work, the baby succulents, and the colors!   Will definitely be returning many more evenings."

Great selection of Texas beers. Very helpful staff who encouraged us to sample several based on our likes including several blends we may not have thought of trying. 2 beers led to 3 and then 4. Sad to leave but had a game to catch. Until next time, keep up the great cheer and beer!"

                "description": "As far as growler places in San Marcos, The Growling is as good as it gets!  With that being said, I've been to growler places in the greater Austin area and IMHO, I think The Growling is better than most of them.  As previously mentioned, there are 28 beers on tap, all Texas-made stuff, but unlike other growler places I've been to they have a bar and you can drink a pint, invite friends, and just hang out. The owners are super friendly and work hard to set you up with the perfect craft beer experience! They even have a stage setup for live music and get live acts mostly on the weekend.  Also, as previously mentioned, there is no kitchen but they allow outside food and with Pie Society, Bobcat nation, Dos Gatos, Mocas/Javas, Rose Garden (Chinese), and Thai Thai in close proximity; you won't have to go far to fight off those hunger cravings! They haven't been open very long (less than 2 months) so they're off to a slow start but hopefully as word gets out they'll start getting busier and maybe even expand on what's an already great start! If you're in San Marcos for the River, the Square, the Hill Country, or in school looking to skip class, The Growling is every bit worth checking out!"

What a great spot - the staff is very welcoming and friendly and are very knowledgeable about the different brews on tap to help you find the right one to fit those taste buds. The beer flight the bartenders picked/poured for me were great and I look forward to coming back and tasting the other brews on tap. Looks like I found a great alternative to overcrowded beergardens in Austin so cheers to more trips I'll be making to San Marcos!"

They seemed to have attitudes of a bar that is not in a college town but a boujee downtown bar. The bartender who was close to my age charged me for regular priced drinks when we ordered 2/3 of our drinks in the happy hour range. When I came to close out and order our (3rd) last drink. The bartender said \"do you mind if I close you out?\" I thought this was very odd as it was a Wednesday evening and I was purchasing not only alcohol but food. I do believe they have an amazing food truck that supplies great food. I am sure this was a one time fluke as the rest of the experience was great. I do stand by my opinion that the staff maybe biased to certain crowds so be weary."

They offer many beer variations and tasty cocktails. Also, a bonus they offer HH/drink specials!"

Friendly staff, good environment, easily my favorite bar in the area. Also, the neon sign in the women's bathroom is great, I hear the men's bathroom neon sign is pretty funny too. You must visit this place!"

I always have a great time here. There's a variety of games throughout the place (corn hole, washers, big jenga) and there's a variety of spread out seating locations / areas. They frequently have a variety of seasonal things on draft as well as a good variety of beers in general. Definitely recommend going to check this place out if in the area and looking for a chill vibe."

That being said, we all got burgers so I feel like it could have been faster? The food hit the spot after a day on the river but just to get the waiters attention was hard work as they only had 4 people on duty. Then to pay the check again it was another long wait. I can't recommend this place if you're hungry, but if you have the time, sure you should go. Prices were reasonable."

Their menu is very over priced and boy do they love their micro-transactions or add-ons.  Fries are extra with their expensive and average burgers. BACON is like $2 extra.  They charge you for using a credit card and so much more.   Their queso is Velveeta and rotel and not even that good. Most of their chips they serve with the queso is tiny broken scraps and they get annoyed if you ask for more.   The staff is either uncaring or over-worked. I have had many incidences where I am eating solo and am ignored in getting service initially and after.  This is most likely because the server is more interested in dealing with the beer drinking frat guys. Almost every time I have been there I have been left without a basic refill of water. Many times i have also sat waiting for my food with no sight of my server.   The only saving grace of this place is the half price wings on Wednesday, but even then I would get them to go."

Place was not that crowded (in the front) and the tables were spaced out.  View was nice to enjoy those strolling by  the sidewalk.  The sign at the front said $3.50 bloody mary's, so I ordered one and it was the bomb (see pic).  Perfect drink that had all the fixin's.  The Chicken and Waffle Bites caught my attention, so I ordered that to hold us over.  These were really good and worth the appetizer! The reason for 2 stars knocked off were the service that was absent throughout our time here.  He disappeared all the time and couldn't find him once my sister and niece showed up.  This service made me decide to go somewhere else for lunch.  The other star was due to being charged full-price for the 2 bloody mary's.  I didn't say anything, as I wasn't sure when the waiter would come back and also felt small businesses need any extra cash during these times.  I still tipped the waiter, since they need money too but not sure how he was so busy with a light audience in the place."

They are my go to burger when I get a burger craving. However, I have heard that all their other specialty burgers are amazing as well.   My one complaint is the service. It's mainly a bar, it's going to be busy- I get it. I've worked the industry. But every time I've gone, something is wrong with my order, I'm double charged on something, or the waitress hardly ever comes to check on us.   I'll keep coming for the amazing burgers- and they deserve the stars, but the service needs some improvement."

They refused to serve me and I refused to stay quiet. I escalated to the owner after his employees all worked together to ensure that customer service is not important to them at all. I spend a lot of money eating out especially to try new things and I support local businesses. But I couldn't try their food because they don't accommodate properly to accept mastercard payment on a to go order (which they now claim they do allow). Hope you all decide to go somewhere else that values you as a customer. Support black owned businesses.  I hope the COVID hits them hard in the pockets."

Taphouse (pronounced Ounce) is my most favorite neighborhood place to go for a quick bite, a variety of drinks, a place for my kids to play, and the most friendly service. They have a shuffleboard and foosball table inside, a playground and outdoor games like corn hole and hook and ring toss outside, AND live music on Wednesday nights.  We have a big family, a complicated order and the people at Oz. TH make us feel like family. The food is excellent (burgers, tacos, salads, fish and chips, and more). We never have to wait too long. If there is ever an issue they are always quick to make it right.  The adult beverages are on a self-serve system and you pay by the ounce. You can get a flight of beer or wine, but I prefer the Fuzzy Navel Hard Seltzer. Yum! We have loved their commitment to the community and love supporting a local business we believe in. Thank you Oz. Taphouse for being a great place to take my family!!!"

                "description": "My husband and I were in town for the weekend and found this place a short walk from our hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Bourbon Berry Cocktail was my favorite! We also enjoyed sampling many different beers and wines on tap. Their crispy chicken sandwich was delicious! Very crispy on the outside and moist on in the inside.   They have crowlers and growlers for 25% off everyday. I really wish they had a smaller to go container as I would've loved to have taken some of the Berry cocktail home - I can't justify the cost of it to take home a crowler or growler. We would definitely go back if we were in the area again."

                "description": "We really enjoyed this place which was an accidental find on our way back from one of our activities in Austin. It is a self-serve concept, so basically you are given a card to scan anytime you want to order a wine, beer, or a cocktail from one of their many taps. You also place your food order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   The fried avocado tacos were amazing and my significant other really enjoyed whatever tacos he had, which I believe were the Carnitas. Why four stars then? Two reasons. One is I was really confused on how much I should tip. I usually don't struggle with this being a bartender, but since we had to pour our own drinks and order food at the counter , I wasn't comfortable leaving a full 20%. Second, when you are pouring your beer, the price adds up very quick. There was one point my boyfriend poured a pint glass and the beer ended up being $22. That was a bit of a letdown. Otherwise the staff is VERY friendly and welcoming -they run a very tight ship. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and the layout with a big outdoor patio is a bonus. Highly recommend, just watch the higher ABV beers because they add up fast!"

                "description": "Stopped by Oz. Tap House for the first time after a Vandegrift H.S. football game, recommended to us by a family member.  \"Go to Oz (pronounced Oz, like wizard of Oz) Tap House, is great.  First things first, we realized later it's not Oz it's Oz.  Notice the period after the z.  Oz. = ounce!  Makes perfect sense when you see the concept.  Dozens of self-serve taps, pouring cocktails, beer, wine, etc.  Way cool!  We couldn't tell how much vodka was actually in the Cosmos we had, but they were tasty!  The Community brand ice tea off the charts too.  Any place serving Community products knows their stuff ... oh yeah, the food.  Definitely \"gotta go back for more\" fare.  Fried cauliflower and jalapeños, nice ranch sauce.  Our server, unprompted, brought some buffalo wing sauce, \"dip a little in here, then the ranch.\"  Awesomeness!  House tacos and cod tacos were delicious, depths of sublime flavors layered into top shelf flour tortillas.  Our only observation was using the house taco slaw on the cod tacos may be a better pairing than the sautéed cabbage... at any rate, the tacos were outstanding.  We'll definitely be back, lots more on the menu to explore.  And a special shout out to James working the register.  Explained the concept, led us through the process, and answered quite a few \"newbie\" questions.  He was great, no need to hire more employees, clone James!"

                "description": "The uniqueness of this place really sets it apart. You are given a card to pour any of the beers on top yourself, which I had seen before and always love. What I hadn't seen was also you can pour wine or cocktails! This experience is perfect for all of those people crawling out of quarantine and not knowing what to do when they cant pour their own drinks. But now you can! And despite the setup involving many hands, Oz. keeps the place sparkling clean.  I can't speak much to the food menu. It's mostly a meat-forward fare. They have a vegan burger patty, but I was told neither of the buns are vegan. Since the patty was really soft, I am not sure it would work as a lettuce wrap. It seems weird to have a vegan patty when you can't have a full vegan burger, but at least there is a vegetarian option.  My mom liked her fish and chips.   I am really just here for the taps though!"

                "description": "How lucky are we to arrive in Texas and meet this amazing place! It was like stepping in paradise. Delicious food and a whole variety of beers.   We tried a few of the beers and had some Tex-Mex.   I tried the sangria beer. I believe it was number 32 on the panel. If you like sangria and bubbles go for it, It's like sangria with bubbles (GF)  Husband had a few other kinds of beers which I tried and oh Man, It was very good! Nothing like I ever had before.   I also had the house tacos (3) with chicken, steak and fried avocado. The fried avocado was definitely a hit for me. It was full of flavor, creamy and crunchy at the same time.   If you are visiting Austin like us and want to drive away from the city you won't regret going to Oz Tap House.   Also, one of the owners is supper friendly we had the pleasure to speak with Sean briefly. Staff is also very nice, patiently explained to us how tap works.   Thanks Oz Tap House for such a memorable welcome!   I recommend this place to everyone!!"

                "description": "I just ordered lunch from Oz tap house. We got fish and chips, fried pickles,  a baked pretzel, a Caesar salad and a cheesesteak.   The pro's: The ranch dressing that came with the fried pickles was pretty good, As was the coleslaw.   The cons:  The fish and chips portion was small and soggy. It was two pieces of greasy fish, that iterally had no flavor. Fish and Chips is one of my favorite foods and I've had it all over the world. Never had I gotten it without flavor. How do you make something taste like nothing? Granted. I asked that the fish and chips have no hot pepper on it. Unfortunately, Hot pepper is the only spice Oz uses.  The fries were cold inside - clearly not hand-cut. The Caesar salad, was spicy in a weird way. It was not good.  The Philly Cheesesteak was very very spicy and greasy.  The Baked Pretzel - Auntie Ann's does a better job, this was a VERY basic, previously frozen pretzel. Nothing special and not worth the price.  The fried pickles - under seasoned and instead of crisp, they were chewy. Again not good.    Everything was extremely spicy, from the fish and chips to the Caesar salad. Food items that traditionally aren't spicy, were all grossly over spiced with hot peppers. Oz Tap House needs to learn how to use spices without making things spicy. Go back to cooking school - Spiced and Spicy! There is a difference! One more thing,  Read dietary notes. There's a reason why people write them."

We were greeted when we walked in,had the process explained etc.  Beers, a couple of ciders,and wines on tap. Pretty cool. I did semi accidentally pour myself 9 oz of wine, so it was a $12 glass, not what I'd typically spend on a glass of wine, but I also typically wouldn't be served 9 oz.  Our food came out quickly and it was really good!  I don't know much it was (folks mentioned auomatic gratuity) bc my husband paid, but it was great and we will definitely come back. They had a playground in the back that we saw,which would be great to come to with our lil people."

Overall everything is a little over priced. Food was sub par. Even happy hour there was only 5 cents off the beer. Expect around $8-9 for a 14 oz beer, and $15+ for mediocre food. And when I went to go tip, they looked at me confused as to why I didn't give them a big tip. Well the answer is simple. I did everything myself while all the workers sat on their phone talking in a booth."

                "description": "I still remember the first time we went there. It was on the slow end of Dirty Sixth, where the old Havana location was.   I recall it vividly because of an interesting Interaction I had with the bartender.  As I looked at the menu, I asked about the pastrami and he said, \"Its good. So good in fact, it's the second best in town, behind Pious Pizza.\"  I remember thinking how it was honest but cocky at the same time. Sure, you may not think it's the best, but you're sure your second best?  Well, he was right.  Fast forward to a cool, hazy night in 2022 at their South Lamar location. First of all, the building is immaculate, an intentional nod to their style and culture. I love it.  My wife had the prosciutto baguette, which was delicious. Although the bread almost stole the show on that one.  The kiddo had the chicken schnitzel and, man, who puts that much effort into a kids plate? Really tasty and well executed.  I, like always, went with old faithful, the pastrami sandwich. My old friend was as delicious as always, as it didn't disappoint. The bread was great but didn't come close to stealing the limelight.   I've always worried about Easy Tiger turning into one of those Austin brands (talking to you Torchy) that loses its way, and I'm sure some may feel that way, but the experience at South Lamar could've been back at that old Sixth Street basement.   Five stars, folks."

A big group of myself and a bunch of other girls had decided that Easy Tiger was the place we wanted to support this night! I was so excited because, like I said, this was a top place on my list of places to go!  We had called the day of to make sure they could accommodate a large group. They said yes. We let them know when we were coming that night and how many of us it would be. All good (we thought)!  Our group starts to arrive at Easy Tiger and we realize that they thought we were coming the next morning and not the time we had told them. Okay, no biggie, we can fix this. We had also been told that there were only two servers that night. You could tell they were overwhelmed. We had made it clear that we wanted to make it as easy as possible for our server since there were so many of us. We were told that they would be able to give us two long tables next to each other so our group would be at least semi close. This didn't happen. Again, whatever... It just kind of sucked.  Now on to food! Yay! Most of us were starving. I can't speak for everyone else but I decided on the Pretzel. It looked so good in the IG photos. When it came out (fast if I may say), it was cold and not soft :( The cheese and other sides it came with felt like they were just taken out of the freezer. Inedible. Sad Ashley.  I drank a Peach Mule that was A1!! That was the highlight of my time here!  Would definitely come back, sit at the bar, and maybe order something different. I'm sure this was just a case of miscommunication and I'm excited to give them a second chance!"

When their 6th street location closed I was so sad, but then like gremlins overnight they multiplied in the best of ways. Having an east austin, and south austin offering and more is such a boon.   We love their snacking/grazing boards. What millennial wouldn't? They're basically adult lunchables. Meats and cheeses and nuts and jams, oh my.   The pretzels and beer cheese are also legendary. But so much so that they sadly often run out of pretzels like they did for us the other day.   We love the use of covered and outdoor seating, especially in this time.   Wanting more substantial fare, they got you. The sausages, pastrami, the blt, all incredible. Really you can't go wrong. So, go!"

Location: upon arrival it looks like an outdoor situation but once you park your car around the back you slowly realize it's a indoor/outdoor vibe. Areas have great coverage from the sun and I love that they have fans as well as Heaters on the ceiling!   Food: The Food was Fan-Freaking-Tastic. I won't lie first glance at the menu I was ehh. Nevertheless I asked my waiter chandler what should I order he made wonderful recommendations.   The pretzel  10/10: crispy outside pillowy soft inside   The Cajun Chicken Sausage 10/10: that prefect snap you want from any sausage casing and the home made Chow-Chow was the prefect topping.   The breakfast potatoes  10/10 : It was like the par-boiled the pots then fried them    Brussels sprouts 8/10 : Great flavor just wanted them a little more tender   Our cocktails 8/10  We order 3 different kinds all three were just okay.   The dessert and bread too take home was also really good.   All in All I would definitely recommend stopping by."

Pog had very citrus-y flavors which I liked. I also got the pretzel which was decently sized. The dips were good for the pretzel.  The bad part... the service. We ordered three beers the first time around, which took around 15 minutes to arrive. The beers weren't really cold at this point. I am not sure how that would be possible but I expect it to be the waiting staff seemingly lounging around talking to each other doing nothing. We asked for the waitress and it took an additional 10 minutes for her to arrive. We then ordered more food and drinks which took additionally extremely long amounts of time. The kicker was that there were two other seated tables so the place was basically empty. I would really recommend going to the 7th location over this one, at least while the current waiting staff is still doing what they did when we went.   Food was alright. Service was shockingly bad."

It is tasty, just on the small side.   The North side location is much better. Maybe this one will improve after construction."

If you're new in town or just visiting, it's worth a trip - I do recommend."

                "description": "This is a joint review from me and my partner. We went on two separate occasions. I went with my coworkers on a Thursday for an outing/birthday. The place itself is cute. Allows dogs. Twinkling lates. Cornhole off to the side. Just a cute, trendy, Austin-like place. But the experience was lack luster. The food took very long. The establishment didn't own enough cups, so part of us had to share cups or just didn't have water. The food was mediocre, save the fries. In this kind of weather, you should be prepared for flies to constantly fly around and land on your food. The drinks are also weak and the time between them will sober you up.   My partner went a separate time. This time I had three things to eat: a strawberry and goat cheese salad, French toast bites, and ricotta toast to share. The salad was ok, but smelled absolutely rank. Even the vinaigrette smelled super off, and not in a heavy-in-vinegar kind of way. The goat cheese wasn't the best, and frankly you could see the indentation of the packaging. The French toast bites bad poor texture. You'd expect to use a slightly stale brioche but instead was a baguette style. It was not soaked enough in the egg mix before cooking for it to have a fluffy texture. Instead, it was hard and unenjoyable. A poor quality baguette instead of the nice ones at real boulangeries. The ricotta toast was the best part, but still wasn't that great. Texture was also off, like an overcooked steak that takes too much force to rip apart. Not only that, but the food took 1 hour to get here.  At the end, they took his card and forgot to return it for 30 minutes. Couldn't get a hold of the waiter and left very late due to him forgetting about us.  Twice have they been very disappointing! Don't recommend this place unless you just want to waste money on a company credit card or take your young mother-in-law that you hate."

We all shared a sourdough bread and wow it tasted so fresh and tasty! It was as if it was freshly baked (which I believe that's what they advertised) and it was more than enough to take home to enjoy for breakfast the next day. We also all shared the sausage sampler with the sauces that go with each sausage which I LOVED. Each of them had their own taste and they did an excellent job pairing them with the appropriate sauce.   As for my entrée, I ordered the prosciutto baguette which was quite huge! Very delightful, but I ended up not finishing it. Their bread portions are very generous.   Would love to come back!"

                "description": "Easter Sunday and no reservations? No problem. My friends and I decided to check out the new South Austin location of Easy Tiger. It was my suggestion and, thankfully, everyone loved it!  We started with a cinnamon knot, a soft pretzel with mustard, and a round of mimosas. The pretzel was out of this world! Warm, with a light sprinkling of Kosher salt, a crispy exterior and the lightest, fluffiest interior EVER!  We got it with a nice whole grain mustard; cheese was an optional side. The cinnamon knot was pretzel dough in a different shape with a sprinkling of cinnamon (it was savory, not sweet). Good, too, but it wasn't warm, so it got overlooked as we focused on the warm pretzel. As you can see from my photos, we were overcome with hunger and I almost didn't get a picture of the pretzel at all! It was that good.  We moved on to the Grazing Board, a side salad, and avocado toast.  The grazing board was truly a show stopper. It included a blue cheese, guyere, and brie, Prosciutto, sweet red grapes, dark and white raisins, slices of sour dough and walnut cranberry bread, tiny, tiny gherkins, candied walnuts, apricots, whipped butter and other toppings. It was visually stunning, but equally delicious. The house salad had the best, giant croutons and a light, delicious dressing with fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, radish slices. The avocado toast was a thick slice of grilled sour dough topped with a generous mound of mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, and thinly sliced radishes. Delicious!  The space at the S. Lamar location is very nice, bright and open. There are several outdoor seating areas, so no problem finding a spot to sit. There might be an issue finding parking, as the parking lot is small (and each parking space is tiny!)  I cannot wait to go back and try some other things on the menu as everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked good. I want to try it all!"

                "description": "Long story short, the drinks were good but the food and service left a lot to be desired. I didn't drink much and I really only took a few sips from my friends beers and most were good. I'm not a beer enthusiast but I have nothing to complain about when it comes to the flavor of the drinks. The food was very underwhelming since it left a lot to be desired. The cinnamon twist was super dry and not very warm. It's like they left it out for a while and just gave it to us because even 10 seconds in the microwave would've made that cinnamon twist soft. The pretzel was a lot better since it was softer and the three dips that came with it were good with mustard being my favorite. However, neither felt fresh. It felt like both were sitting out for a while since a freshly baked pretzel would be much warmer and much softer.  Okay with all of the good or mediocre stuff out of the way, I just wanted to say that the service here was one of the worst I've had in a long time. My friends and I ordered some beers and it took 20 minutes for us to receive them. When we got them they didn't feel as cold as they should be which leads me to believe that they were poured earlier and forgotten there. I question how it takes 20 minutes to deliver the beers when we were one of three tables there and you simply need to pour the beers into a cup. Every time my friends ordered more drinks, there was usually a 20 minute delay before the drinks arrived. When we asked one of the waiters if he could get our waitress, she didn't come until 15 minutes later. There was no urgency in the servers and they were just hiding behind the divider chatting it up. Good service needs to be the waiters and waitresses coming to us instead of us searching for them. I've heard a lot of good things about Easy Tiger and I think I'll be going to 7th street Easy Tiger given how poor the service was here."

                "description": "What a gem on South Lamar! There are some business that have survived the pandemic, some that have folded, but there are very few that have creatively embraced it. Easy Tiger has gone beyond that where they started the business during the pandemic and built something absolutely majestic.   Drinks - Ofcourse the beer selection is amazing but the best part is that there is something for everyone. They have a great selection of wine and some really cool cocktails.   Food - This was a pleasant surprise. I have never heard my food snob wife utter the words \"This may be the best avocado toast I've ever had\" .. not just that the Brussels sprouts are a delight and the egg sandwich is really good too  Ambience - This is where they go from being great to phenomenal.. the outdoor area is a perfect setup and the best part is that they have a little kiddie park for the little ones. All this overlooking the green belt.. does/can it get any better?   One thing to add .. on a good day parking lot gets full very fast so plan accordingly!   A must must go for a nice sunny day or otherwise :)"

                "description": "I can't complain about the beer. The cinnamon twist I ordered was 1.5/10. It was hard and stale, and the temperature was lower than lukewarm. If they tried to reheat it even just a little bit, it probably would've been much better.   The service was absolutely appalling. We ordered beers, 1 for each person for 3 people total when we arrived. It took about 20 minutes for our beers to arrive, and it wasn't even busy. There were only 2 other tables at the time.   When they dropped off the beers, I asked if I could order another one. He told me he'd get the waitress for us, but she took another 15-20 min to come get our order. The whole time during the wait, I noticed that a decent amount of staff (4-6 people) were standing around chatting with each other in the back. The whole time they were chatting, we were waiting for our waitress to give her our next order of drinks.   TL;DR: Extremely inattentive staff, with very slow and poor service. Staff doesn't seem to care about the customers at all, and the cinnamon was stale."

                "description": "Easy Tiger is a pretty popular spot to come up when planning a trip to Austin, so we decided to see what all the hype was about! We visited as soon as we got to town, so we got a bit of a sampler lunch. The server informed us that their bakery was down so anything with their bread was off the menu for the day. This was a particular bummer because that also meant to pretzels which I'd heard a lot about! Regardless, we find some great bread-free options.   We settled on the kale salad, sausage platter, chicken schnitzel tenders, fries. The fried were amazing-- waffle cut and so crispy!! I am not a huge kale gal, but the kale salad was also amazing and made me feel better about the fries!  The sausage platter is a fun way to sample a few things, but the server dropped a couple pieces of the brat when bringing our platter and didn't acknowledge it or offer to replace them which was a bit awkward and disappointing (why I deducted a star). Overall, the brat was the least exciting option on the board so we just enjoyed the rest, but it wasn't ideal.   We also got a pitcher of one of their Austin pale ales which was a great light lunch pairing! Their beer menu is pretty expansive with both local and classic/safe options.   Parking was a bit tight because this spot is so popular! On a Saturday for lunch our wait was 20 minutes which was very reasonable. They also have a little park area for kids which is fun!"

First off, I love how you sit, order on your phone and the servers bring stuff out. Super efficient and felt safe during these COVID times.   Second, the outdoor seating is spacious and has a great view of the kids play area so you can keep an eye on them while you eat and drink.   Thirdly, the food is delicious! I got the seasonal pasta salad and fried Brussels sprouts and both were excellent.   And last but not least, the coffee is awesome! I'm from Seattle and have high coffee standards, and I just loved my cappuccino.   Thank you for offering a kid-friendly place for us to hang out!!"

                "description": "Solid choice for a beer garden. It's a bit off of the main street which makes it quieter, but it seems like they could have switched the building / beer garden with their parking lot and offered their guest a view too. Either ways, came here on a good weather Sunday and waited for around 30 mins which is OK, plenty of open seats but I suppose they were careful with Covid. Service itself was also a bit slow - you order via a QR code and your own phone, but the food itself took a bit to come out. We had a large pretzel, Bratwurst and a turkey sandwich. The pretzel was great, warm and soft. Sandwich was also good, with a nice brie, very filling. Could have had a bit more of a side with it than the couple of salad leaves. The bratwurst was also decent. We saw lots of people walking out with baguettes and the likes, so supposedly those are good and worth a try.  The beer selection is OK, assuming you're a fan of smaller breweries that do a ton of hoppy brews, nothing really Pilsener like in the selection."

                "description": "A beautiful fall evening in Austin deserved a patio visit. We sat upstairs and the view didn't disappoint. We just missed the sunset but the sky was still stunning.  We grabbed some menus and decided on drinks and a giant pretzel. We also got the charcuterie board. My friend got a margarita which is said was 4/10 on a scale of margs. I tasted it and to me it tasted like a melted frozen margarita. Way too sweet for my liking. I wanted a cab (wine of choice) which they didn't have...I got a Malbec which wasn't horrible but I prefer a good bold cab.  The pretzel was great as always and the charcuterie board was well laid out. Neither one of us like the almonds. They had some sort of oil on them. What I really was sad about was the jam. I was hoping for a fig jam but it was not. My first bite was not good at all. I even asked the waitress what it was...she very nicely called down to the kitchen on her little mic and found out that it was a strawberry ginger jam. Those two flavors do not go together in my personal opinion. The ginger was way too strong and over powering.  The cheeses on the cheese board from Antonelli's Cheese Shop were on point. The goat cheese with honey was great. The blue cheese was yum and the Gouda was \"Gouda\".  ba dum tss.   Overall- this place is a no brainer for a casual night with friends over a pretzel and a beautiful view."

I think we got there at the right time because we were able to secure a seat inside where it was considerably cooler than the outside seating.   The process for ordering was fairly simple and the lady helping me was kind enough to break it down for a new out-of-towner. We got 4 sour beers and they were really interesting. On this particular occasion I had a new experience after I finished my 2nd sour beer. I learned that sour beer gives me heart burn. 1st time ever. I was asking my friend what this fire in my chest was. She loved the sour beers she ordered and we got glasses to remember the occasion. BOB... you'll always be my first.   I recommend checking it out and if you like sour beers Blue Owl Brewing will put a smile on your face. The staff is friendly and hip, and the beer flows as does the good times.   Prohst!!!"

We ordered a glass and got 4 beers with the glass, if you are not able to finish your 4 beers, they will let you take the extras to go in cans! I believe the size we got was $20 per person. They had about 3 different options for sizes of glasses. The girl said we could even share one order if we wanted less beers per person.  I love all the options of the beers (they are all \"sour\" and DELICIOUS)!! My all time favorite that I tried was the Jubilberry!  The only complaint I would have was parking was a little hard to find but we ended up parking in a lot close by.  We will definitely be coming back when in Ausitn!"

I cannot recommend it enough -- thought I didn't like sour beer, oh boy I was wrong. Absolutely ADORE the Tangerina, Tiki Hop Totem, Plum de Plume, Limetastico and Jubilberry beers. And they had a Plum de Plume + mango beer slushee, so yum! Patio was very full on Sunday so we had to wait to snag an outdoor table but it was worth it. The staff is always incredibly nice and feels safe for COVID. Every Thursday they spin a wheel for a growler deal -- entire growler of amazing beer for $9! And their merch is so cute, definitely have a koozie collection now. Biggest perk of in-person is if you buy a beer glass (pictured here with a very cool design) you get 4 pours for $16.

                "description": "A brewery that does only sours! I was so happy to find this place while exploring East Austin. You know, it's been a while since I walked around a neighborhood without my phone constantly telling me where to go. This time I did, and Cesar Chavez led me here and to so many other amazing spots!   You walk in, order a glass that you get to keep! And then you get 4 beers in that glass! The best part? If you are like me and get the cool goblet at 16 oz. you can't drink that much beer at once. You can keep your tasting card and come back for the other 1 or 2 that you maybe couldn't do at visit #1! I think the limit is about a month between visits, but I'm not sure. Honestly, we came here 3 times. One time we didn't have our tasting cards so just did 4 tasting size glasses. Yes, we are big fans and came back to Indy with 4 glasses!   The patio is covered which is great during Texas spring/summer. If you're lucky, and someone leaves and hands you their card, double bonus!   I highly recommend visiting because even my husband, who does not love sours as I do, found a beer he liked (Van Dayum), and we even passed on the love to my sister-in-law who lives in RR! (How has she not been here yet?!)"

If you don't like sour beer, verify by trying the definition of it at Blue Owl Brewing because \"The Owls are not what they seem.\" - yep, they're Lynch fans of the best show to make it to TV.  BOB is your uncle and your favorite sour beer. Come in and select a size, get 4 samples in that glass, and when you finish - keep it! The glass is yours.  Heavy rotation keeps its original and I love it. They have some staples for those trying to have a routine.  Buy some swag and get the brand out there! #LittleBossIsMyFav #BlueOwlSightings"

Sure, you can split it or take some home but sometimes I just want 1-2 beers on site and not have to buy 4. My boyfriend and I came and bought the 4 but then wanted one more. Nope, buy 4 more or none. We picked none and left. I just wish we could come and buy one or two beers without being forced to buy 4."

For $16, my friends and I each got a normal sized glass to take home and 4 pours of any choice (you can do 8 half pours). There are also different types and sizes for glasses, so you could opt for a bigger or smaller glas.   Beer/Sours: Great quality drinks with a wide range of flavors. If you don't like sours this may not be the place for you, but definitely give it a shot if you like beers in general.   Service: Nothing to be said here, super nice and friendly staff! Felt right at home.   Atmosphere: Great! Nothing that prevents you from enjoying your afternoon or your conversation.   Definitely coming here again, hopefully I'll collect all 4 glasses!"

                "description": "If you like sour beers, youll love this place. Personally i find it gimmicy. The sour beers dont do it for me. Also they make you buy a pint glass before you can order.  The main draws are that its in a cool neighborhood, i like that the beers are highly alcoholic. Also their patio is dece, but it could use more seating. Finally, their gimmicky ordering system causes people to leave free beer tickets around constantly. I like free beer.  The big gimmick, which I find annoying, aside from the sour beers buying a glass when you to get a drink. When you buy one, you're basically comitting to four 12 oz. pours and possibly coming back in the future. There are other sizes, but the 12 oz. Is the best value and it feels weird drinking beer from a shot glass.   You can bring a glass you already bought, but overall its annoying to bring a pint glass to a bar. If i wanted to clean my own glasses, i would drink at home. Thats why youre kinda commiting to coming back by buying one.  They give you a sheet to check off the number of pours. The sheets are transferable and can be used on different days so make sure to hold on to them. Also, we usually find a sheet of people who didnt use all their pours so youll usually get a few free."

                "description": "When we were walking over to this place from Lazarus brewing my wife said, \"I think they only have sours\". I was like no way, I will just grab an IPA or something... Oh man was I shocked to see that they literally only had sours. With that being said let me start this shockingly high review for a place that only has sours by saying... i do not care for sour beers. So a 5 star coming from a person who doesnt enjoy sours should say something.  I loved everything about this place. This place is in a cool location, has a great logo, has great aesthetic, and a really cool flight idea. If it wasnt all sour beers... I would live at this place.  Let me explain how the flights work here. You pick your glass size... If I were to guess I would say 4oz, 8oz, 12oz... but honestly that is a guess. Then you get 4 samples in that size. You bring up your sheet, they check off the beer and you sample it. Oh and the best part is that after you are done you get to keep the glass. Oh and the prices are not crazy. I want to say it was $6, $8, $10, but that might also be off. This is definitely one of the coolest strategies I have seen for flights at a brewery ever... Oh and the glasses all looked really neat for sure.  Now onto the beer. Like I have mentioned multiple times already, I am not a fan of sours, but I liked the initial flavor of most of these beers. We had the wee heavy, the red, the earl grey one (lazarus colab), and the cherry stout. Everything had a great crafted flavor, until I hit the sour note. I relied on my wife to drink most of these, but I was very impressed by everything for sure. And my wife was happy with everything as well.  I would suggest anyone in Austin come visit this place for sure. Definitely worth the trip and more so if you like sours!!"

The concept though was something I've never encountered. You can't just walk in and buy a pint of beer. You must purchase a glass, which comes with 4 pours. There are a variety of glass sizes from taster to full pint and the prices are actually pretty cheap ($16 for the full size glass and 4 pours). If you are already in the area and want to try something different it's worth a stop but probably wouldn't recommend going out of your way."

                "description": "Spent a whole evening here due to the unusual policy of requiring you to purchase a glass that comes with 4 pours. We drank our 4 14 oz pours over the course of a few hours, but it's nice that we had the option to bail earlier and take home a can instead. The patio is nicely set up with distanced tables, fans, and hand sanitizers at every table. We brought over food from Vegan Nom, a couple minutes walk away. My partner and I each tried 4 different beers. All were delicious! This was our first visit to the brewery despite buying the beer from stores many times. I would definitely come back but with the awareness of the policy that you have to buy at least 4 12oz pours (you can split amongst multiple people though). I think the real highlight of visiting the brewery are the frozen beer drinks. They had a \"Mexican Marteeny\" available the night we went, which is based on the Teenybopper ale with some other things mixed in. Amazing, and a great final glass! The bartender was lovely and was able to answer all our questions, too."

                "description": "Visited Blue Owl Brewing on Sunday evening. Extremely different and very bold beers, but even as someone who loves sours, difficult to get into.  Quality: I visit breweries relatively frequently, and I can confidently say Blue Owl Brewing is doing some very interesting things. From the way you order to the explosion of sour, nothing is familiar. We went with the Half Pint Glass and tried four beers, Little Gose, Van Dayum, Hop Totem, and Professor Black. I also got a sip of Cool and The Gang and Admiral Gravitas. And while you expect a gose to be sour, the red ale, IPA, cherry stout, and imperial oatmeal stout are not things you expect to pucker your lips. Does it work? I don't really think so. The standard sours were good, but the other styles are just overpowered and lose their charm. I give credit for going bold, but I think the experiment went too far. Quantity: Guests choose an 16oz, 12oz, 8oz, or 5oz glass, which then comes with four pours. Value: $12 for the Half Pint Glass with four 8oz pours. Ambiance: Blue Owl Brewing is located east of Downtown Austin. The brewery is in a good sized warehouse, but the taproom is relatively small. Most of the space is taken up by equipment. Out front they have a skinny patio area running adjacent to the street. Inside they have a bar at the center and then a few tables with high tops surrounding it. The decor is very cozy and homey. In the background indie hip-hop played along, which felt like a good choice. I will say the collection of games they had to occupy visitors, much like the beers, strays from the norm. With around twenty games, I had never heard of any of them before. Crowd: A few other people, but most did not stay very long. It is a very niche style of beer, and it is not really for many casual beer drinkers. Service: The ordering method is strange, which I am sure is annoying to the staff. However, everyone I interacted with was extremely friendly. Parking: Limited street parking on the main stretch, however parking can be found along the side roads."

                "description": "Blue Owl is a sour's paradise--but before you click away my sour-beer-haters, let me tell you that I'm also one of you. I'm not a sour fan, even though I've done my best to try it every time I hit up breweries. Blue Owl is different...here's why.  True, their beer menu is all sours. That usually turns brew lovers like myself off, BUT keep reading the descriptions of the sours. They brew the sours with other beer varieties that some may enjoy more--hefeweizen, lager, IPA, you name it, they make it. It's called sour-mashing here at Blue Owl. I KNOW. I was drawn to their extensive menu and had the opportunity to try two that night. I love hefes, so went with the Litte Boss, which was a session wheat sour. VERY crisp and refreshing, almost like a lager, and exactly the perfect start to my beer tasting here. The great thing is, ALL beer drinkers knowledgeable or novice, can figure it out. Their menu has a timeline that tells you what is lighter on the palette, and what might be harsher. Their Little Boss was on the clean/light side, so I knew that would be a great starter...and it was! I also chose the Hop Totem because it was an IPA sour, and it didn't actually have as bitter hops as I thought it would. It was not as bitter, but the sour taste came out more for me...so I preferred their Little Boss more.  We stood at their standing tables, as all the other tables were full. They have board games (SCORE!) and every beer lover's favorite things to hear--A GLASS FOR KEEPS. Yup. Mine is sitting in the freezer in its new home. There are various sizes of beer selections, so take that into consideration when you're deciding what size of your drink to get. Also, you can ask the sweet taptenders if they have any stickers lying around--and you might get one for free!"

Food truck outside serves a good sausage and fries but everything else besides that is about $8 or more, with most things averaging out to be $11-12 per menu item, a little pricey in my opinion for food truck foods.

Beer is decent; not the best I've had but definitely a good effort for their own craft brews.  Atmosphere is a good cross between German and Renaissance-y, almost felt like we were hanging out at the ren fest.  They have a contactless ordering system set up - all ordering is done via website and they call your name when your beer is ready at the main indoor entrance.  My main complaint is that every individual order on the website REQUIRES a food order ($3 french fries from the nearby food truck when we were there).  So if you're chilling here for an extended period of time and like me, order your beers sequentially after you finish each one, you have to get an order of french fries with every single beer order.  I understand this is because of the Texas law requiring 51% food sales in order to classify the establishment as a restaurant to stay open during the pandemic.  But don't force me to help you meet your 51% quota with each drink order I place.    If other breweries can do it without adjusting their way of ordering, it can be done. We eat too many french fries, we won't have room to try more of your beers!"

                "description": "The Draught House Pub has been around for 50 years which is unheard of from a business perspective so hats off to them! I'd say there's a lot to like about this pub which exudes a European vibe with all the wooden decor and dark lighting. The first point of interest was their tap board which was operated by Digital Pour. This thing gives you a ton of info! Not only does it list the beer name, brewery, ABV, style, and price, but it mentions the serving size and gives you an illustration of the serving glass and -- the most intriguing feature -- the keg volume status. You're even able to deduce if they have more than one keg of said beer. I have never seen this anywhere before as most pubs and breweries -- if they use a digital tap board -- turn to Untappd. The only downside is that they have a crap ton of taps, so you have to wait for the projection to scroll through a few screens to get an idea of the full tap list.   The initial impressions were already very positive, so the fact that they served tasters was another added bonus. I believe they are known for their nightly specials and there was one going on for that night which I think was 50% off their house beers. The flight wouldn't have applied for this offer, so like we ordered a half pour of their *Triple Double*, an excellent 8% IPA. Very surprising, but the stout they brewed for their 50 anny was fairly normal. Roasty, easy-drinking, and mild.   Overall, this is a legitimate watering hole, offering the variety needed to appease every kind of drinker and the chilled out atmosphere sought after by every thirsty adult."

                "description": "I'm thrilled that we finally hit the Draught house for a few cold beers on a hot Sunday. As others have noted this a chill pub with a million (really about 70) beers on tap. They even had a Frose' available, not sure why.... (joke)  There is limited parking on site but on the weekend there is plenty of parking next door. check their website for additional parking Info. You can either hang inside, in the AC, or chill outside in the shade. Be sure to bring your mutt as well.   The beer is king here! If you can't find a beer to your liking then you ain't looking hard enough. Their Summer Ale and Rosedale Blonde was perfect on a hot day.  They were out of their featured IPA but the Bombay IPA was perfectly fine.  This would have been an easy 5-star review except for the bartenders on duty this past Sunday. Maybe I did not have a cool enough t-shirt on, was not a regular, or my 20% tip per round wasn't enough but lose the effin' attitude. When I walk up to order and say hi don't just nod and ask what do you want. when I ask you how would categorize an IPA don't respond with \"it's a regular IPA\" WTF is a regular IPA there are about 10 different styles of IPAs. When I ask is it similar to a west coast same response...   Seriously, if you just want to serve your regulars put a sign out front stating so. We'll return for the beer selection as it is fabulous but I'll be sure to adjust my expectations regarding the service..."

The man who took our order and gave us one sample each was unfriendly. He looked like he didn't want to be there at all. Killed our vibe! So we quickly ordered 2 pints and sat down to finish our beers."

                "description": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  This is a beer drinkers brewery.  Seemed like an endless amount of beer on tap (but probably about 60 if I had to guess).  Really hits every variety and they offer tastes even before buying.  I went with a flight to try 5oz of 4 pours.  Good portion but I was charged $1 which is pretty excessive in my mind.  Other than the price, I liked the place and location.  Really a beer forward establishment with no TV, darts, and tons of seating indoor and outdoor.  This is not your new age place - come here to drink and to conversate.  Dogs welcome and parking tough in the lot but plenty along the street.  Overall I enjoyed myself and considering free WIFi I can  forget about the lack of TV.  For beer, this is on the short list in Austin."

We have very different tastes and were able to find four beers each that we absolutely loved. Lots of local options!   They also had a food truck outside, which provided some much-needed sustenance after our flight. We shared the falafel plate with fresh veggies, pita and hummus.   The back patio was a nice spot to relax in the evening air under a heat lamp. We moved inside for a cozier atmosphere once it got too chilly."

Definitely an older crowd, but I'm sick of going to bars and seeing fresh 21 year olds drinking until they pass out; you'd never see this here. One of my favorite things about Austin is the craft beer scene and I love going here and getting whatever the bartender recommends. There's some sort of special or price reduction nearly every day, whether it's on IPAs, wings from the food truck, or all beverages. Even at full price, it's reasonable. Inside gets really crowded but parking is much better than other places I go. Would recommend it to any other beer lover!"

Service is excellent and great beer choices. I didn't immediately realize you can order flights, which is always a game changer for me.   Pro-tip: If you're not \"eating\", you can bypass the wait and go right into the bar... where you can also order a very large pretzel the size of your head. What else could a girl need?"

Our waitress was super friendly and gave some good sausage recommendations. Don't need to add the fries next time though, they were average. The craft beer selection was endless - I was glad to be looking at the options on my phone instead of at the bar because there's so, so many tap handles!   There was live music for a chunk of the time we were there, and some friendly people around us."

The vibe is truly what Austin represents and is in the perfect location.  The beer garden has so many different beers on tap, especially the best local ones. I strongly recommend the Live Oak Hefeweizen. If you're in the mood, they are also famous for their Manmosas which are an entire champagne bottle mixed with Oj. Their food is also amazing too - I always get their jalapeño cheddar sausage. The giant pretzel and Mac and cheese are great as well!"

The large smokehouse out back provides an aromatic invite right off the street.  Living up to your name is easy for Bangers, they offer a very unique and impressive sausage menu, and if you're not a fan of sausage they have plenty of other options available. Although I did not try the vegetarian options, I was told they were phenomenal by some pretty picky vegetarians!  The sausages are absolutely excellent, they seem to love the garlic aioli here which I do now as well, ketchup isn't the only thing that belongs on a brat. The beer garden is plenty big for any size group and the staff are excellent hosts.  Cheers!"

The street is really charming. Bangers was super packed at 2 PM on a Friday afternoon, so I was excited to try it. There are 2 options: Full menu and Light snacks/beer  During my first visit, we went with light snacks and beer. Snack selection included chips, pig skins, pretzels. Not much to choose from here. The beer selection however, was a large selection and we were really impressed! Each beer ranged from $5-10  During my second visit, we came back to try the food. It was quite disappointing and really heavy. The servers were great though CHARRED LETTUCE: Lettuce did not seem fresh, too much sauce LOADED FRIES: There are a few different options for the loaded fries, but all of their fries are thick cuts and very starchy  DUCK FIG HOT DOG: the sausage was piping hot when it got to our table. The fig and onion were on the top, but only enough to cover the middle of the hot dog. Sausage felt super heavy and my group of 2 couldn't finish it Would probably come again to grab a beer, but pass on the food"

Unfortunately over several attempts this year, I've found that not to be the case.  Most recently not only was the ability to split checks super reduced, the waitstaff was also unattentive, ingenuine, and borderline rude.    I've definitely also had positive experiences before their big expansion, but it seems clear that quantity is winning over quality at Bangers these days."

The wait was only about 30 minutes so we came back, prepped and ready to chug some Manmosas.   Yes - the manmosa is strong. I don't think I would ever be able to finish a whole thing by myself. But I do love a good challenge.   We ordered a pretzel too. U know, to soak everything up. It was definitely a step up from Auntie Anne's, which is basically the only pretzel I've never had before this one! Banger's was soft and pillow-y. I guess I've now experienced what a real pretzel is, and I don't think I can ever go back to mall pretzels again.   I'll definitely be back with more pals. Maybe to try their sausages next time!"

Seating indoors is self serve and you can order snacks (pretzel) but not food (sausage).   We sat inside while waiting for our table outside; that took about 20 minutes.  Once outside, as busy as it is, a wait staff will swing by to get your order.    Have to say I'm not a sausage person but theirs was good.  We had the Chinese bbq sausage and it was delish."

                "description": "This was a cute little beer garden off Rainey street. It is huge so great for parties of all sizes. They have servers, but you can also order at any of the walk up bar areas.   The food was average. Tried several items and they all were just ok. The brussel sprouts and salad were very good, but I didn't feel anything was amazing. But if you're looking for more of a vibe and don't have high expectations for food, this is probably the perfect place. I will say, that they are apparently known for all their sausages/meats, which I did not have so that may have knocked them up a star if I did try those (so, sorry for anyone reading who is a sausage fan here and disappointed I didn't try any since it's a staple)!  They have music, but assuming they also host live music as well, just not the night I was there.  The staff and service was just ok. The wait was long, but it was on a Saturday and they don't take reservations, which was expected and was fine as we popped over to another place and had a drink while we waited. I feel like the service could have been a little better and a few more smiles from the staff wouldn't have hurt.   I don't live in Austin, so I'm not sure I'll be back or I should say it's not at the top of my list when I return, but I wouldn't not recommend it. If you're looking for a German beer garden with a good selection of beer and authentic food, this is probably the place for you!"

It was also my first time visiting and I got a chance to go with her which was awesome! We got there around 7ish and since it was Monday we were able to be seated pretty quickly. Once we sat down I ended up ordering:  *Poutine fries - these came with cheese curds and gravy - altogether the flavors were bomb! I would get these - just wish the gravy had a stronger flavor  *jalapeno cheddar brat - this was really yummy and came with topping of mustard and grilled jalapenos. The sausage was super fresh and the flavors all went really well together  *beer - got this coconut flavored one and this was bomb!!  Overall, really enjoyed the vibe, the warm breeze and the lights. I would recommend one to try this place out!"

                "description": "One of my favorite spots on Rainey Street. Bangers is a fun beer garden, perfect for a relax vibe. They have so many beers and ciders on tap, but they are known for the \"manmosa\" which is a pitcher of champagne (literally a whole bottle of champagne) and a dash of orange juice. They only allow 1 per person and make you order a snack with it! The options are pickles, pretzels, etc. The pretzels are my favorite. They were soft and so flavorful, not too salty, and comes with mustard. Perfect for sharing. The sausages are quite good as well!   Just be aware that it is PACKED on the weekends, especially Sunday.  I don't live in Austin anymore, but I'll make sure to come back when I do visit!"

We sat out in the patio area in the back, in which they had the fires lighting.  Ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Chicken Fried Steak. Food was delicious and portion sizes are huge! I was a hungry boy going in, but definitely needed a doggy bag for this one.  Simply the best Southern Comfort food in Austin. Can't wait to visit again!"

                "description": "Called on Thursday 5:30pm and there was no wait for the patio so the hostess told me to come in. I was there 15 min later and another hostess (didn't get her name but she had a boy cut haircut) told me there's a 30 min wait. When I told her the waitress who answered my call said there was no wait, she then lectured me twice that I should have made reservations. Thought that was rude (before this, I've only ever thought Austinites were super sweet) - my first time here and the waitress on the phone didn't mention I should make a reservation twice. Shouldn't need to be lectured at the host stand and again when seated. Luckily another person came by and said we could be seated right away and luckily, the rest of the experience was fine.   We ordered the chicken fried steak and jalapeño hanger steak. From the photos, I didn't realize how ginormous the chicken fried steak was! It's the size of my forearm and can easily feed 3-4 people. It was my first time eating chicken fried steak and it wasn't bad. I'm not a friend food type girl but it was decent. I could only do a few bites as it was heavy. The jalapeño hanger steak was right up my alley. You have to eat it with the jalapeño; it's the perfect combo. I only wish they gave 2 jalapeños. The mashed potatoes also went perfectly! The popcorn, cornbread and drinks were also good. The Old Fashioned was smooth and the pink drink wasn't too sweet.  The waiter was much more pleasant than that hostess and the ambiance outside was lovely. I love that it's dog friendly and my dog was allowed to sit in my lap at the table (some places only allow dogs on the floor but my dog is a lap dog). They also brought a dog bowl. Overall really like it here and would come back and recommend!"

It was walking distance from our hotel on Third Street.  We got seated at the patio outside for a party of 5, and they adjusted the shade for us since the sun was in our face.   The service was okay, the food was pretty good. The size of that chicken friend steak was definitely Texas size! The cocktails were delicious. We even got a flight of moonshines, but that was a bit hard to drink. It was way to sweet for me personally.   Overall: Cleanliness: 8/10 Food: 8/10 Service: 7/10"

If you're looking for something on the lighter side, go for the Migas. Both the Beyond Veggie Burger and Backyard Chicken Sandwich hit the spot as well. They even accommodated my friend's request to switch the bread to a biscuit. The sauce that comes with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots is phenomenal.   They have great heated outdoor seating (tent style), wonderful servers, and generally a great atmosphere!"

The pimento was very flavorful and the pretzel sticks were baked to PERFECTION.  For my entree I had one of their fried chicken sandwiches. The chicken patty was very thin compared to most fried chicken sandwiches I've had, but the flavor was still there in every bite. The accompanying fries were yummy as well!  NOTE: on Mondays they have 50% off wine bottles. Just in case that's useful for you ;)"

                "description": "This restaurant just kind of pulls you in from the street. Being one of the oldest buildings in Austin, this place is obviously well known, and we were lucky to get in.   The atmosphere inside the restaurant just emanates southern charm and the menu offers some excellent southern comfort food entrees. Any time I find an appetizer not normally seen on a menu, I have to try it, and in this case, it was the deviled eggs.   I typically don't have the courage to try anyone else's deviled eggs because I am very picky when it comes to those, so I swore they better be good and they were very good. They were creamy, flavorful and had no pesky surprises like celery or relish.  One thing I never thought I would eat for dinner is chicken and waffles and being in Austin I decided I had to try. I was impressed with the seasoning of the chicken and the light breading. The waffles were fluffy, they came with plenty of butter and syrup. This entree was the epitome of sweet and salty, and a little bit spicy.  The staff are great, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is alive. Cheers!"

The beer and bourbon selection is wide and very good.   We had the Pearl Snap Pilsner and the Convoxt Hill Stout.   The devil eggs were beautiful but the egg white had tight flesh. Was either over cooked or too long in the fridge. But we did arrive for dinner after 9pm.   The cobbler dessert looks great. But did not order it. Just admired from afar.   Excellent decor and ambiance in one of the oldest buildings in Austin."

Had we gotten there later, I think we'd have had to wait quite a while. Its flooded with customers on the weekend! Curious what it would be like during the week? ‍  Service was wonderful! Our waiter was fun, knowledgeable and attentive! I think that was the case across the staff. They take the service seriously!   The food is decadent! It's heaping portions with a southern flare. I got the green chili hash that was pretty good. My favorite part of the meal was the biscuits we ordered as an appetizer. Delicious!   This is a great spot! My friends and I enjoyed it! The menu is pretty straightforward. You'll walk away full of yummy food."

                "description": "I hadn't been to Moonshine since before COVID, but am glad to report they are as good as ever.   By the reaction I got from our waitress when I asked, I'm not the only one who misses their legendary Sunday buffet, but apparently it will be back when things settles down, contagion-wise.  I cried a little when my Irish Coffee arrived with no whipped cream on top, but it had Jameson and Bailey's, so it would be churlish of me to complain. And the complimentary popcorn made up for a lot.  My companion was not crazy about her entree, Creole Crawfish and Grits. She was hoping for something along the lines of Shrimp and Grits, but instead got some grits swamped by a sort of stew that had more ham than crawfish. She's one of these incredibly polite people who won't send a dish back to the kitchen for anything less than serious culinary malpractice, so she just picked at it and left most of it.  I was delighted with my choice. The Chicken and Waffles were about the best I've had. The waffles were amazing, as was the chicken, and there was way more than I could eat--and believe me, I can eat!  The dessert my friend ordered made up for any disappointment in her entree. The Peanut Butter Mousse Pie was world-historic, as far as I could tell from the bites I was allowed. And it was huge--most of it went home with her.  The service was excellent, the prices fair, and we even found street parking."

                "description": "10-28-21  Quality/Quantity - Great Happy hour. We ate so much we had to take leftovers to-go. Free popcorn - excess butter and salt, just the way I like it. It also opens up the liquid appetite (beer!!!). Lone Star Beer - refreshing, especially on a hot day Brussel Sprouts - not as crispy as I would have preferred, but the family liked it Fried Green Tomato - not bad, but once you had Lucille's Fried Green Tomato, others are hard to compare. Cathead Biscuits = 6 stars!! This was a hit. Very generous portions, hence we had to take our entrees to-go. The flavor, especially with the butter and honey, took it over the top. Seared Rainbow Trout - Good, but we were so full that we could not enjoy it, no fault of theirs. They also have a Sunday Brunch.  Atmosphere - Both indoor and outdoor dining. There seemed to have more outdoor dining than indoor...? It looked like they had a private event in the back. Men's urinal was broken, and amazingly there was NOT a line for the one toilet for the Men's restroom. Valet parking is offered for $12 by Austin Valet Parking LLC.  Be careful of where you park in this area, sadly there was lots of car vandalism.  Service - All team members were working hard and offered good service. Hannah took care of us, but the \"busboy\" took service to the next level. He even talked to us while we were waiting in the lobby before being assigned to our table and gave selling suggestions.  Price - If we did not order our entree, then this happy hour dinner would have qualified under one of our \"best inexpensive meals\".  Owner Suggestion - Please keep your restrooms in top condition. Or, post signs if you have restrooms in other locations in the restaurant. Other than that, great job, especially with your happy hour menu."

                "description": "Moonshine is a great place for brunch, or any meal, as the menu is solid and the service is on point.  Looking for a quick bite to eat before heading out of town (to return home) we arrived at Moonshine early and did not have any lines to deal with. In fact, we were seated immediately and began to peruse the menu.  It was early, so we passed on drinks (though their whiskey list was well populated and the \"little brown book\", available upon request, certainly peaks a whiskey hound's interest). Ultimately we decided on a couple sandwiches and placed our order with our friendly waiter.  He returned with our drinks and a basket of DELICIOUS spicy popcorn! What an appetizer! I polished off the entire basket without hesitation and it was everything I could have hoped for and more.  Our meals arrived shortly thereafter and we dug in. Everything was very well prepared and tasty. Personally, I had the Sunday House Club and loved it. One point of recommendation though: go without the bacon jam as I found it to only serve to diminish the flavor of the pimento cheese and make the sandwich more messy overall.  As previously mentioned, the service was great. Our waiter and the bus boys were there exactly when we needed them and we were in and out in no time flat. What a great cherry on top of the experience.  Moonshine can get rather busy as the day progresses so I suggest you arrive early and enjoy the food, service, and ambiance. While we didn't check out the patio it looked and sounded very inviting. This place really serves the entire package and you won't be disappointed in your visit."

                "description": "I would put this place closer to a 3.5, but I can't quite give it 4 stars. They don't take reservations and we were a larger party. By the time we arrived, the wait was 45-60 minutes. We anticipated that and a table opened up in the bar area, so we order a few appetizers and drinks. The bartender got very flustered with us and at one point just walked away mid-order. Being a large group primarily from the northeast, maybe our personalities didn't jive. We did recover, but it was off putting since that was our first interaction with the restaurant.   The biscuits were a hit with the group. The pretzel was ok. We were seated a little over 90 minutes later. By that point I wasn't super hungry, but I ordered the harvest bowl with chicken. Overall, I found it dry. We did sit outside which was really nice as the night was perfect for outdoor dining. Our server was really good and was on top of everything."

                "description": "Industry leading!  Well I was finally able to get to San Marcos and got to walk around the square. In doing so I found several bars and coffee shops which was great! The bars were still pretty empty being that it was only 3pm and I needed human interaction! That was when I found Industry. It's no secret that Industry is great, based on their reviews and I was happy to have found it to be so close. For me, there were 3 things that really separated Industry. The first being my bartender, Madison. She did an outstanding job making sure I felt welcomed and was quick to present water in which I especially appreciated given the heat. She knew the beer menu and gave me a few recommendations, eventually nailing it with a beer called Easy Rider. I recommend it if you're into a craft blonde ale. I also ordered a dirty martini  and ask her if she would make it the way she usually does, which turned out great. She used Botanist Gin which was perfecto with just the right amount of floral. Thanks Madison for the solid recommendations and the hospitality. Very much obliged. I ordered the Brussel sprouts, of course, which were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful (light) mustard finish. My only complaint was the size of the sprouts, not to be confused with the portion size, which was more than enough for one person. I just figured it had something to do with the season and happily ate up. I was 3 for 3 and couldn't have left happier.  Industry is a really cool, upbeat spot and I will most definitely be back when I get the chance. They are dog friendly, too, with water bowls and treats in the patio area.   Highly recommend!!  Sincerely,  MLA"

                "description": "TLDR a-ok to I'm a fan despite some bumps  My first time ordering for pickup. Everything was delicious, it was ready at the time promised. The big flaw was I didn't get the beer battered squash I ordered and paid for, but as Mr R didn't check the bag before leaving we cannot lay that all on them. It was a very busy night and mistakes happen.  The other error was I didn't get the 30% off to-go booze still advertised on their online menu which is why this isn't 5*  Mr R is besotted with their black bean veggie burger. I think there must be spice in the patty as none of the other listed ingredients explain its lovely low heat. He also likes the texture of the bean patty, he wanted me to mention that.  The salmon burger was good, huge, nice fresh veg, I love the spice in the aioli and poblano ranch, but I REALLY wish they still did the smoked salmon bagel I had one brunch there long ago.  The farm beet salad? Gorgeous. Mr R gleefully ate most of it on his own and he often eats salads with a sense of duty rather than joy. I loved the white balsamic vinaigrette it came with, I'm going to need that more often in my life.  The drinks to go? Hooray! One note, bring your own standard brown pulp drink tray if you think you'll need one because they didn't provide one. The pours were fabulous on our mimosas, The Closer and White Box. Ice was the perfect amount.  The transaction could have gone smoother, but the meal went down great. This remains a place Mr R wants to go *every* time he's in town."

Then I sat down, had an outstandingly healthy and delicious everything bowl that went extremely well with the excellent recommendation of Pilsner made by the kind and knowledgeable staff. The owner clearly takes pride in the experience and it shows. 5 stars might not be sufficient, I wish I had the ability to allot additional stars. Bravo"

We had an awesome time with Thor as our bartender last time we were in town. He was there this time and we got to say hi again. We sat at the bar and Raina took great care of us! We tried 2 lagers from different TX breweries and had some great shots. I could not decide among 3 choices for dinner, so I let her pick and surprise me. She chose the al pastor tacos.

The $11  mimosa carafe special immediately got my attention. I knew I had to have that. Found us a booth on the left corner by the bar. Ordered the mimosa, 2 industry burgers, Parmesan fries and the tater tot casserole. The mimosa was disappointingly room temperature. The burgers were bordering on salty but were good. We especially liked the chips and salsa that came with it. The fries were good but a little expensive for what you get. The tater tot casserole , we didn't like at all. Very salty and the hot sauce did not go with the dish at all. Don't think we'll come back."

We also had the queso, salsa, fried squash, loaded fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizer and all were a huge hit!! Most of the teenagers had the burgers and did not like them. They said they tasted like sausage. I think the issue is the burgers were very, very lean and smoked so they were a little dry.  The BIGGEST COMPLAINT were the flies...OMG!!!

My favorite was definitely the sweet benny and chili cheese fries. I'm not usually a chili cheese fry fan but this chili is legitimately so delicious with chunks of brisket in it! The biscuit and jam combo is delcious but it was definitely more suited for 3 to 4 people instead of 2 with other dishes ordered. In hindsight, ordering 2 types of fried potatoes was probably over kill but still delicious none the less. I didn't try the half off mimosas but for sure next time, I'll definitely be getting a cocktail to try!   The staff was super friendly and great at getting our food out in a timely manner. The vibe out there was perfect and a lot of fun with the live music!  They seemed very on top of the cleaning and everyone wore masks when standing."

Also, since we sat at the bar, we watched Tiffany in full \"go-time\" mode.  She was professional and personable; making it look easy to provide drinks for a whole bar/restaurant single-handedly.  Although the process was apparently moving slower than normal, the interactions with her made it much more tolerable and it was a lot of fun talking to her.

EPBG has made a HUGE change to the menu and quality of ingredients!  #NewChef #GoodFood #NewBrunchSpot #TheNewOasis  A friend wanted me to go to Brunch and said I could pick the place.  I wanted to go somewhere new and saw that EPBG had a great menu for Brunch.  I had recently heard that the food was good now, so why not give them a try?  You know it is difficult to find a great brunch spot, not to mention one without an hour wait or more.  I ordered the Hippie Scramble and was very pleased.  For $14 the dish came with fresh spinach, wild mushrooms (not some cheap white mushrooms), heirloom tomatoes (that tasted like they just came off the vine and red onions.  The dish was topped off with homemade Hollandaise and Goat Cheese.  I told the Chef multiple times that I was in love with his goat cheese.  OMG I think I could have eaten a plate of that alone.  My friend had the Crab Cake Benedict, and I must say that too was delicious.  Tasted like fresh crab (it was not Krab) and the portion was too large to finish.  The fresh dill on top complimented the dish nicely.  Special shout out for the high-end paper plates.  Seriously, they were so nice that from a far they looked like real dishes.  I will definitely be back to try out more dishes on their new menu, enjoy the live music, libations from the bar and take in the phenomenal view."

                "description": "NEVER AGAIN! So sad and sickened at the same time. We need more places on Lake Travis and EPBG is such an iconic spot, BUT they have not/are not properly handling the COVID-19 pandemic. They have taken very few measures to keep their staff and patrons safe from possible infection (sure, I'll take a little hand sanitizer).   As an area resident, I've visited EPBG (and every other name it ever had since Carlos n Charlie's closed) many many times. I want the property to be open and thrive, but not with an owner who apparently places little value on human life. Plus, to be completely honest the food is barely above par (wings ok) and the drinks are $$$! $7 for a CAN of Infamous that I can buy a 6-pack of for $10 two minutes away directly from the brewery. I get, lake prices...look at comps though. Speaking of drinks... color me intrigued that EPBG is labeled as a \"restaurant\" (i.e., more than 51% food sales). Anyone else ever been the weekend drunk fests? I have. Hmm...literal food for thought. Shame on you Barrett Branam!"

We ordered a few items to include loaded queso and the double cheeseburger.   The Cheezborger! Cheezborger! You want doublecheez?!?Who's next!?!\" -SNL  The quality of an establishment's cheeseburger often tends to be a good indicator of the quality of the food in the establishment, especially if that establishment that tends to have a limited menu which highlights the burgers such as this one. My double cheeseburger was outstanding. It was freshly grilled and the charbroiled smokiness  could be tasted throughout the burger.   The view:  As far as this locations view was concerned, it was simply breathtaking at dusk. If you are in the area on a cool Sunday afternoon, there are very few consumers here and you are sure to get an exquisite shot of the sunset. Even if you don't come here for the food, come here for a relaxing time with some friends, you won't regret it!"

It's a new endeavour in a tried and true location so being in the hood we wanted to give it a chance and try the food.....pfffft!  We looked at the menu and most prices were average.  I knew goin into to this that the Catfish Basket was $15.  That almost twice what some other places charge.  So the catfish was something out of this world......in a bad way!!!  The filets, if you want to call them that were not recognizable and they were as thin as a quarter.....yes, a 25c piece, kinda leathery and shouldn't be served as food.    That's a typical drinking straw in the photo.  Real catfish filets are 1/2\" to 1\" thick.  So sad that this place may not make it through the summer.....definitely won't make it through the next drought."

First, the view really isn't that great especially compared to other establishments on the lake. Second, drinks are pricey. $7 for a bottle of corona and $7 for a Truly is pretty high. Finally, my meal was just awful. I got a Texas Cobb that was missing blue cheese, avocado, and croutons when it came out. It maybe had 1/4 slice of bacon on it and that's being generous. The cucumbers were old and soggy so didn't get eaten.  One very small egg and few bites of weird looking chicken were hardly filling. At $14 this salad was an enormous disappointment. We definitely won't be going back."

We went Saturday and there was a new menu (no more of most of our favorites) but tried it out. We ordered two pizzas, a burger with fries and the stacked Cobb salad. None of it was good. The pizzas were undercooked and greasy and for the price of $18, highly disappointing. The Cobb salad had a nice presentation and toppings but lacked lettuce. There was no crunch at all. The burger was an improvement from the previous menu but the fries weren't done. You could tell they were undercooked. We won't waste our money on food here again and are super disappointed in the changes made. Bummer for Lake Travis boaters!"

                "description": "Came in this past weekend to celebrate the weekend with my friend at Circle Brewing.  I love their beers and have had them at bars and restaurants around town but had never been to the brewery until this past weekend.   Circle Brewing had easy parking as soon as we pulled up even on an Austin FC Saturday game day. It was pleasant to not have to figure out where to park when they have their own parking lot with plenty of space.   Easy ordering but hard decisions to make on what pitcher of beer we were wanting to try. We noticed they have Austin FC game specials that includes their Austin Anthem draft for $18 a pitcher which is a great deal! I also saw signage on the tables that indicated 1/2 pints during the Austin FC games. Double check that is right because it almost sounds too good to be true, right? I even saw a green cup special going on - ask the bartender what they have on special just to be sure.  They have a lovely and large screen set up right in the middle of their taproom to watch any games including those Austin FC games. They have a couple of tv's as well located above the bar to keep your gaze on during any game not just Austin FC.    If you are coming in the summer especially day time be sure to wear loose clothing and/or be ready to sweat. Even at the bar top with the fans going we came out of here sweaty which is typical anywhere you are during Texas summers. Just want to give you a heads up!  Huckleberry is the food truck that slings all sorts of seafood and burgers (surf and turf!) with some easy ordering from inside the brewery.  We didn't get a chance to try out their food as we ended up brewery hopping around right after we had our pitcher of Blur (hefe) at Circle.  This may be the closest brewery to the stadium (?) but if not it sure looks like it as you can see the Austin FC stadium right from their parking lot.  Excited to come back when I am headed to a game and/or in the area as Circle Brewing beers are divine!"

Some in our group loved certain beers, including some of the lighter bodied and hoppier beers. Others in our group liked the beers but didn't find any favorites from among the fight. Overall it was a nice experience - perhaps not our favorite stop on the brewery tour- but one worth going to again."

                "description": "I've been here for a Sunday funday and more recently did the 2021 Cookies and Craft Brews at-home virtual tasting with Circle Brewing Beers and Girl Scout Cookies. The vibe at the tasting room is casual and approachable - the staff is friendly and unpretentious. For the virtual tasting I did, they had the packages ready for pickup and hosted the tasting on Zoom. It was fun even if I was tasting solo from home as there were others on the Zoom and the two who guided the tasting were informative and engaging. Here were some notes I took during the tasting:  Alibi Blonde and Shortbread - a nice blend of the maltiness and breadiness of the cookie. The beer is a blending of German Maibock style with American Blonde Ale, resulting in a rich, malty flavor with a clean, crisp finish.  Blue Texas Hefe and Caramel deLits and Peanut Butter Sandwich - this is their best-selling beer (about 2x any other) and is a traditional German Wheat beer with a touch of caramel malt and an emphasis on citrus notes. It's refreshing and definitely a Texas twist on one of my favorite types of beers.  Envy Amber and Toast-yay! - this is a new cookie this year and they paired it with the first beer they ever brewed, although it's not the first beer they released. The cinnamon toast crunch flavor of the cookie worked well with the robustness of the amber. It's an English style amber with an emphasis on dried fruit notes - they use two types of British caramel malts to contribute to the well-rounded flavor of the beer.  Ladybird American IPA and Lemonades - this was one of the pairing favorites of the crowd and I definitely liked it a lot too. It's a West Coast style IPA that is very hoppy, but not overly bitter. Solid pairing and solid beer.  Tuxedo Shirt Black IPA and Thin Mints - the hops in this beer are changed annually, so it never really has the same flavor profile year to year. I was not familiar with roasted IPA malts, but it's basically an IPA with black malt. It has a bold, roasty flavor, with a solid body. It was a smooth pairing with the Thin Mints.  Nightlight Dry Irish Stout and S'mores and Peanut Butter Patties - this beer is the CO2 version of Guinness. There is a slight bitterness to this, but it has a rich flavor with a very light body.   A few other bonus takeaways shared in the tasting conversation: * Epic Playlist is a beer that they created to interact with their fans in the market. It has a QR code on it that connects the drinker to the Circle Brewing Spotify playlist. * Devil's XX is a barrel-aged version of the beer (XX) and is sold in bottles. * They are keeping this tasting room, but also expanding and moving to a location in Elgin where they can grow their own ingredients to put in their beer on the 23-acre property."

                "description": "I've come by a few times and always found it to be a good experience. The staff is friendly, the beer is consistently good and they go for styles that are much less popular from Austin breweries. They also participate in some fun events throughout the year, in particular I really enjoyed the beer/girl scout cookie pairing event and the red line brewery tour.  Highly recommend trying the Blur, its a Hefeweizen and their staple beer. I would put it up there with Live Oak's Hef as a common point of comparison. If you're around in the winter time their Doppel Blur is probably the best Hef I've ever had; Imagine if your alcoholic grandmother made banana bread in liquid form. If you're looking for something darker the Tuxedo T-shirt is a black IPA, I really liked the combination of roastiness and hoppiness. It sounds like it would clash but I found the hop flavor subtle enough to work really well.    The one negative I would have is that the interior really makes it feel like they're trying to get you to sit outside, which given the vast amount of space available in the parking lot makes sense. However I don't feel like they do a great job of utilizing it, there aren't nearly as many tables as you would think and the ones they do have aren't particularly well spaced out.  The food truck situation seems to rotate pretty frequently, I've found most of them to be misses but it's a roll of the dice depending on the day. There's also plenty of good food options in close proximity that it doesn't feel like a major negative.  Overall I think Circle makes for a good hang out spot and a change of pace from the typical Austin brewery experience."

They're known for the Circle Blur, a hazy hefeweizen, but all of their beers are good. The Austin Anthem golden ale is refreshing and \"crushable\" and the kolsch and IPAs are good too. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and host free pre-events for Austin FC games next door."

                "description": "Beer is good, staff always friendly... but damn does it get hot as the third ring of hell during the summer in there. Maybe \"stuffy\" or \"swampass humid\" is more accurate, but it's uncomfy when busy. I'm from southern Texas, so I'm used to it.. but it's even hot for me. Need some big ass fans or something. But.. the cold beer does help! And the food truck outside always looks good, but I've never partook in the tasty treats.   Gonna be a go to for many (including myself) pre-FC games, just hope they're OK with me only wearing my FC boxers once I've been there for 20 and sweat through my less-than-fancy Target shorts I got for $20, so I'd have more $$ to spend on their tasty beer."

                "description": "We were near this Brewery on a Saturday in early March, so decided to stop in and give it a try.  It just so happened it was a special beer release event and charity donation (for Pink Boots Society and Pink Velvet Collaboration IPA), so it was crowded.  We lucked into a table inside and tried a sampling of beers while we played a game and listened to a few interesting sounding bands that played (standing on the loading platform).  Because it was so crowded, it took a while to get served and the line for the single person bathroom was very long.  The beers we tried were good, and we would definitely stop back by on a day that wasn't quite so crowded."

Big variety of beers - and probably the best English pub ale in Texas that isn't a big brand beer. I personally think they would gain to have a tv or two once the MLS stadium opens. Overall great experience and plan to come back. Oh yeah - super dog friendly!!!"

                "description": "I was so pumped to check our Circle during a brew-crawl, but the ambiance left me feeling unimpressed.  I had my first sips of Circle after being introduced by every Texan's good friend HEB. I believe it was the hefe that reeled me in, so I was excited to go to Circle during the Red Line Brew tour (check it out online if you've never done it). I was so excited to try a few beers, but knew I could only focus my tastes on one since we were on a crawl. I went with their Cereal Keller kellerbier which I've never tried before. It was described as \"unhinged\" probably because this stuff is unfiltered and not clarified! I was psyched to try a grittier version of the lager. It wasn't as funky as I thought it would be, but instead felt light, simple and slightly malty/sweet. I enjoyed it. I was pretty curious about all their others like their IPA's and the Doppel Blur, but that's for next time.  The space itself is definitely reminiscent of your small-production and grassroots taproom. They had two porta-potties outside (along with a food truck), but only one restroom inside. It got pretty crazy with our crawl of beer lovers. I can't imagine the staff members sharing one restroom, especially when the brewers are in there doing their thang. Someone's bench with weights and press station was still out, and there wasn't that much open space indoors for the lot of us to all be in there, so outdoors it was! They allow dogs which is awesome and they also have wifi. Parking seemed a-plenty, but we took public transport so that's that. Their gigantic chalkboard menu is beautiful and fully rounds out their super relaxed and earthy vibes. The people here are friendly, chill and the brewery gives off a neighborly essence. It's not an instagram-hotspot like their new next door neighbor Hopsquad. And that's the beauty of it!"

                "description": "Perfect day to celebrate Circle's 6th anniversary. With the Temps hovering around 90 degrees what better way to while away a Sat afternoon than having a few scrumptious craft beers, street tacos and listening to some great music.  My companions opted for their Alibi Blonde it is a German-inspired beer but it drinks pretty light but with a hint of flowery hops that gives it a good aftertaste. I opted for their Ladybird IPA that also drank surprisingly light for an IPA and was perfect for a hot early spring day. I did see a lot of folks drinking their black IPA but it was too warm a day for that, next time.  The event was top notch 15 bucks, American, got you a cool pilsner type anniversary glass and 3 beer tokens. We gave 3 tokens away at the end as we were getting full and we !had! to attend a friends crawfish party later that afternoon. Got to leave room for dem bugs and more brews!   The first band was a Go Gos inspired female band that rocked and the second band played some great 70s, 80, and 90s cover songs. Since I was wearing a Boston Sports shirt I got to meet some other Massholes which only added to the fun.   Good times, great beer, and a wonderful event!"

Not only are there tons of events that are always happening there, just for fun or to support local organizations, all the employees there are so kind and really attentive. They also change/add different beer options often which is great if you're looking to maybe get your favorites and try something new. I'd highly recommend the doppel blur and although it isn't on tap, you can still get a can in a glass of you want. If you're really wanting something on tap then I'd go with the blur! I'd definitely recommend going and bringing your pup because they are very pup friendly everywhere !"

Not only is the beer great, but the location and setting speak to the nostalgic part of me that's seen a few little start up breweries begin to flourish out of industrial parks, and often with their taprooms in the brewery space itself. That's what this space is--Utilitarian is too strong a word, but it's comfortable, practical, and cozy. We've enjoyed days playing games out on the picnic tables, and others indoors on the barrel tables. The staff is friendly, and there's always parking available, or you can take the light rail or easily bike from this brewery to others nearby!"

This feels a lot more like a sports bar with some outdoor space than a \"beer garden.\" When I think \"beer garden,\" I picture something with more ambiance (for example plants, string lights, communal tables, music maybe). Instead, here you have a patio with many TVs blaring the game and a dark, concrete/rock picnic area. Yes they have some string lights... on the outer edges of the parking lot #doinitwrong.  That said, they have a great selection of beers and the bartenders are really friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the food trucks out back. Soooo, if you're looking for a chill spot to catch a game with some great beer, this will fit the bill! If you're looking for a \"beer garden,\" like for a casual date, not so good."

                "description": "The place has a roadhouse atmosphere, most of the staff looked like they were operating a biker bar which at first made me feel a little intimidated, especially when they ignored me. The gentleman at the bar acted like whatever paperwork he was doing was more important than paying customers.  After getting my beer I walked out to the patio to find a place to sit. I was greeted by what I assume was the owner (but again the biker appearance threw me off). He was polite, welcomed me and my party and let me know that he was there if we needed any help.  The seating was comfortable and fun. There was a food truck where we ordered nachos. They were good.  After returning for my second beer I recognized that the beer was flat. I alerted the staff, they gave me another but it was still bad. I suspect the lines need to be cleaned she apologized said she would take it off my bill, I chose another beer and moved on.  Later when lying she charged me for the bad beer anyway, so confused.  Anyway, overall I was disappointed with their beer selection, and disappointed with the staff attentiveness to customers. Had they taken better care of their beer I could have looked past their other shortcomings, but you have to get the beer right if you advertise yourself as a tap house."

                "description": "This review is mostly for the food. As of June 2020 the food truck on site is HBQ bbq which doesn't seem to have its own Yelp page - which is a serious problem because it needs some serious love! You know the standards for bbq are high in this town, and HBQ holds its own very well for being virtually unknown. My favorite part of a bbq meal isn't actually the meat, it's the sides, so I was excited to see the selection! I ordered a little of everything (well, not everything, but about half the menu... enough that the cook asked if it were for one or two people when he saw a tiny girl come to pick up all of it!) I ordered what I thought would be a chicken salad sandwich, but maybe I ordered wrong or maybe their idea of \"chicken salad\" is different than mine, because what I got was a typical chicken sandwich - sliced chicken, slaw and what seemed to be mild hot sauce on a hearty roll. Despite the initial disappointment, it wasn't too bad for a chicken sandwich. It was huge! A good deal for the price. However, I didn't want to fill up on it, so I was glad when my friend's son expressed interest in the other half of it. More room for the sides! The hatch creamed corn was amazing - other friends raved about it too. It had a bit of a kick after a few bites, but nothing a spice wimp like myself couldn't handle. The mac and cheese was billed as \"sriracha mac and cheese\" but was not spicy. It was average in a good way, slightly on the not-so-cheesy end, that would be a disappointment to have alone as a meal, but definitely enjoyable as a side dish. The cucumber salad was surprisingly good. I didn't expect much. Who gets excited about cucumbers? I ordered it out of curiosity and so I could feel good about eating some token vegetables. It turned out to be a real sleeper hit! It was a bit like eating pickles, toned-down enough that I could eat a whole cup of them without being overpowered by brine. When they loaded the \"loaded potato salad\" they weren't messing around! It had a lot of cheddar cheese and bacon, and some green onion. Apparently they rotate their pie selection, and this time they had peanut butter ice box pie. The cook asked how much whipped cream I wanted on it and I told him not to hold back! It was obviously delicious. Obviously. You're probably wondering about the meats, because this is a bbq truck. I was with a large group, so I got to hear everyone's review of just about everything on the menu, and everyone was impressed. I know they tried brisket, pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese loaded with meat and queso, and queso as a dip. All servings were a pretty decent size for their price. The queso was the only unusual thing - it was more like movie-theatre nacho cheese that most Texans wouldn't call queso. However, apparently once it was mixed with brisket, it was good, and I saw several servings of it get finished off.  Like I said, I was with a big group, and the venue accommodated is well.  Drinks seemed satisfactory. (I only had water.) I think I heard live music coming from inside. Kids enjoyed the small playground. (And to tell, the truth, at the end of the night, I went and climbed on it too.) Picnic tables, shade coverings, parking bathrooms and all those important amenities were good. I wish this place was closer in to town, but if it were, that might ruin what they've got going. Despite the long drive south, I'll be likely to return! Update: I checked their menu and they have two chicken sandwiches. It looks like I ordered the wrong one. No wonder I was disappointed, but that's good news for the rest of y'all to know that their chicken sandwich is a decent take on a typical chicken sandwich. But I'm still craving a good chicken salad sandwich..."

Sat at a table for 3 hours worth of drinks and food, then a young group of kids in Halloween costumes came in, slapped a \"Reserved\" piece of paper on our table and management told us we had to move.  Shipping container restrooms reeked.  Food sucks.  Won't be back.  Much better options.  in South ATX."

The majority of the building has a patio area, so it's a perfect place to grab a beer after work, on the weekend or even mid day even during Covid. The bartenders are super friendly and helpful. Definitely check them out."

It was rather cold that day but we opted to sit outside so we can have prime view to the TV screen.  They brought out heaters for the outdoor seating so there was some warmth to be had.  The drinks were a bit on the expensive side but they're showing the fight with no cover so it was worth it.  What I really enjoyed was the food trucks out back.  The food was amazing!  I had the BBQ plate and the cream corn and mac and cheese were so delicious!!!  The BBQ itself was great of course.  The atmosphere was really fun and I definitely would come back to watch the next UFC fight."

Again, i place to stop by after floating the river( normal times) or shopping at the outlets!"

We were a bit more casually dressed as I would've liked, but it's okay because it was our first visit.   The vibes here are amazing. Everything looks nice and sophisticated. We both had drinks, a couple of martinis and something else that I can't quite remember.   The Brie was something new to my boyfriend, and we really enjoyed it. My Margherita pizza was perfect and my boyfriend Chicken Blanc pizza was also sooo good. I think his was better than mine, lol!   I recommend this place to everyone I run into. It's so cute and the perfect date night"

This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Bec we expected more selection. They have a few cheese plate options and small gourmet pizzas. I chose the pear and bacon pizza, which was delicious. my husband had a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a sangria flight, which was quite nice. On Thursday nights they offer a free lava cake with the purchase of a flight. The lava cake was tasty. The servers were friendly and the decorations were nice."

There is overflow parking across the street, appropriately signed as extra parking for Patio Dolcetto.  Someone put a lot of effort and love into designing the space.   Alex the bartender was very friendly and our group had good conversation with him.   They have a Sunday Special right now: a bottle of wine (5 options) and a cheese board for $25. The cheese board had water crackers, Marcona almonds, dried apricots, craisins (?), jam, Olive tapenade, a smoked Gouda, a cheddar - almost like TJs unexpected cheddar, but more firm and reminiscent of Parmesan (not crumbly like UC), and a chèvre (I think). All very tasty.   We did the special twice. The White Zin was given to us on accident (instead of the merlot we requested) but they're very low key and friendly and we try to be easy going (especially about wine!) so we enjoyed the Zin.   I look forward to checking out other specials and enjoying the nice atmosphere outside when it gets a little cooler."

I ordered the white sangria, which fair warning was very sweet but it was still delicious. The menu said the white sangria had ginger in it, although I didn't taste that specific ingredient I was hoping for, it was still a good choice. They do wine flights as well, and have a pretty good happy hour.  We ordered a cheese board and sat at the bar. The cheese board was generous and filling, the service was great, and the atmosphere was on point. It is a casual wine bar, and they had live music outside which would have been nice to watch aside from the cold weather. They have a lot of seating outside, and a good amount of community seating inside.  Overall, great experience here and will be hopefully going back!"

I'd imagine before covid the dining room held a few more tables.  The Paul's chicken is a large breast breaded in chips, topped with lots of hatch Chile and shredded cheese. I liked it better after asking for a side of white gravy.  The green beans are honest, not cooked to death, still green. The baked potato was typical, though not seasoned on the outside like I'm used to.  All in all, it's plenty.  The chicken fried steak was two pieces, actually seasoned in the breading, tender enough, and disappeared quickly. Gravy is good too.  The scratch cheesecake was good. I got plain, without toppings, which they offer a few. It's baked, not too dense, thick enough crust.  The bread pudding was a cereal bowl full of yummy. Pecans and raisins all smothered in a bourbon sauce, not an icing. Very good.  Prices are a smidge high, but expected for the area.  Staff was pleasant, quick to respond.  I'll come back next time we are in the area."

Perhaps try flattening the chicken breast instead of cooking a big lump piece. My fault to have eaten it!  Fries were not fresh either. Guess I was hungry and the bartender was too busy to ask initially."

                "description": "Nice lake view restaurant in marble fall, the price is very good for the portion of food. Most of the food is about $10 unless you go for steak. There's outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with large window with beautiful lake view.  The service is very fast and attentive. I ordered calamari which are top with cheese powder which seems strange, it's also like a calamari fingers instead of rings. With cheese is not my favorite part. The fish taco came in three large pieces of taco with the two pieces of filet in each taco, huge portion. The green chili burger is juicy and has a good kick to it but the buns are soggy which needs some improvement."

The shrimp were OK but cooked just a little too long for our liking. The sweet potato fries were just barely cooked and were just limp and tasteless. The cole slaw was actually pretty good. I doubt we'll return, which is a shame given the nice view they have."

                "description": "I want to start by saying that the service here is probably the beat I've experienced since the pandemic began. In a world where so many restaurants are understaffed and waiters overwhelmed, the team here could not have been more attentive from the moment we sat down. There was no waiting for anything - they were incredibly intuitive and knew just when to check in with us and offer refills or bring extra napkins. 5 stars for the service.   The food was pretty good which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I had a delicious green chili burger, but the calamari fell flat for me. I don't know why they sprinkled parmesan cheese on it. My recommendation would be to offer this on the side.   Overall, solid option in Marble Falls with beautiful views over the lake. Sit outside when the weather is tolerable."

We got a table on the balcony. Weather was perfect, staff was friendly, food was good and view is awesome. I had the fish tacos which I loved and she had the pulled pork tacos that she liked a lot. Portions were perfect as was flavor. My only gripe would be paying for salsa and chips. This is Texas! It should almost be a given to have chips and salsa at the table! We will most definitely be making a return trip."

I told the hostess this was our first time here and wanted to celebrate our anniversary on the patio. She immediately took us to the worst table on the patio. Thanks. The waitress had no problem putting us at one of the best tables on the patio. Your awesome! All staff were wearing masks. We ordered the Texas grilled Reuben and the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Both were wonderful. Very seldom does Glenda finish a sandwich! Fries were good and the coleslaw was wonderful. I'm a huge fan of  Long John Silver's coleslaw, sweet and creamy. Very few places make it like that. River City Grille's was a perfect copy! Glenda stopped me from licking the bowl. Now, if your eating wonderful food on a wonderful patio at a wonderful restaurant facing a wonderful lake, your going to pay through the nose. Nope. Normal prices. That's why 5 stars. We will definitely be back."

We started with the BK salad which was quite enough to share with a large amount of chicken.   I would definitely recommend the chipotle vinaigrette dressing. I had the Buffalo chicken tacos for dinner. The chicken portions were huge and tasty. The rest of the dish was plain but solid. My wife had the fried shrimp. Food quality was overall good. Price a little high for hers for what you got but not terrible. The salad and tacos were quite reasonably priced.   Our server had a trainee so not sure if the reason our service was slow but definitely slow service for how empty the restaurant was when we were there.   Overall still a solid dine at a local place and would definitely consider going back on a return trip."

                "description": "So this is our SECOND time here. In town for another golf tournament at Horseshoe Bay. I remembered this place from last time and figured we could give it another try. There are a few more things to note this time around... 1. Staff is underwhelming and not friendly. I mean, they're cordial enough, but for a small town, it doesn't seem like they try to get to know you.  2. The patio- so we were able to get a table out on the coveted patio. To re-use the word \"underwhelming\", the patio is such, super outdated and could use some TLC. Cobwebs beneath some of the metal mesh dining chairs should not exist if daily sweeping and wiping down of seats were being done. The floor could also use a major cleaning. Rails could use a new coat of paint and the patio could use an overall power washing.  3. No wonder the wait for patio seating was 45 mins long the last time we were out here. They only have about 8 tables out there. And being on the Colorado River, it's easy to see why people would just want to loiter and hang out, which means tables don't turnover quickly. Although we are in the \"dreadful times of COVID-19\", I believe they could easily place at least four 2-seater tables to dot along the patio rails and still maintain the appropriate/safe distance between tables.  4. I tried the pork chop tonight (the hubby enjoyed them so much last time). They are small, 7 oz. including bone, marinated in a brine overnight. Even found a few whole peppercorns on my chop. I'm used to a simple salt (or garlic salt) and pepper seasoning of my chops, so the flavor was off-putting for a simpleton ingrate like me. LOL! But the brine makes them very moist, so that was a plus and they are definitely cooked over an open flame. I had char marks for days!  5. Had the chips and queso/salsa appetizer again and enjoyed it. I'd recommend that.   Re-reading my first review, I realized that I was too generous with the 4 stars last time, so I'm down-grading to 3. My recommendations to management on this trip would be to spend a little money for a minor facelift and add some aesthetic appeal for the comfort of their customers who appear to be \"regular\" locals and visitors like us visiting the area.  This is for both the inside and outside dining areas of the restaurant. Considering the cost of the food here, I don't think this is too much to ask. Please also train your seating staff (hostesses) to be friendly and communicative. This is our second visit and the second time we've felt this area of staff were \"cool\" and unprofessional. Our server wasn't jovial and offering foot massages, but at least she spoke more than a few words to us and was professional and effective. The 3 females at the front hostess podium are just awkward, staring and make a strange impression. These are the first (masked) faces your customers will engage with and whom will represent your business, your brand and set the tone for your customers' entire dining experience. Take this seriously. I don't think we'll be back. There are other places to try out, but we wish you much luck and success."

Got cut off because we were a large group that had a large tab even though no one showed signs of having been over served. Don't plan on returning at this point. Wish something close had a late kitchen, but at this point I'd rather have Top Ramen than go here to get food after 10. Slow service and management that pretends to have people's best interests makes it a no. Food is good, but management that seems judgy makes it a no."

Service is hit or miss; the first time I came here and asked for a booth, the bartender became extremely frustrated when explaining their seating policy. They were busy, but still.  The food. It's good but not great--also, it's a sports bar, so it's on par with that cuisine. It's close to our house and nice enough, so we'll keep coming back for a beer and a game."

                "description": "So it's been 6 months or so since this place opened, I've been a handful of times since and thought I'd write a quick update. My first review came shortly after opening and we all know it takes time to get things in a good rhythm and sorted out, especially in the restaurant business.  The menu was a little odd to me when opening but has since won me over. They often have specials and have even opened up for lunch. Last weekend they had a crawfish boil at a very reasonable $7 lbs. The beer selection seems to be somewhat static, fortunately they have several to choose from, but it would be nice to have several rotating handles, given we are in one of the best craft beer markets around. I was a bit surprised to learn a local Pinthouse beer was $7. It's only a dollar more than at the brewery, but still, this isn't LA.  All and all, I like the direction this place is going, nice outdoor, dog friendly patio, food specials and hopefully some new local beers on my next visit."

Most places are these large indoor/outdoor spaces with music and food trucks. Or located downtown. Or you have to drive 30 plus minutes.  Vincent's Sports Pub is just down the road from home. It has plenty of TVs. I mean plenty. You can stand or sit anywhere in this pub and watch your game. AWESOME. A lot of thought was done here with the placement of TVs.  Service outstanding. A very friendly and nice Team. You like beer. You have choices. Lots of drafts and bottled beer choices. Great feel. Very welcoming pub. Plenty of tables. Great looking bar. Nice crowd. No jerks or muscle beer dudes. I judge a place if my wife would feel comfortable alone. Vincent's Sports Pub passes with high marks.  The food is very tasty. I had most of the apps and was very happy. Tasty. Great to share. Shrimp dish very good. Crispy. Wings have some pull and good. Nice pub menu. A scratch kitchen. I did not feel or taste it was a frozen product.  Vincent's Sports Pub will definitely be my go-to pub for drinks and sports on TV. It has a nice welcoming feel. Combination of design of the restaurant, the bar placement, the tables, food and most importantly the staff.  Plenty of parking. CC friendly. Union payment option."

Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

This place is totally chill with a few picnic tables to relax and converse with friends. There is also a couple of other chairs if that's your thing. Sampling on sight is totally cool too.  On to the selection of beers. All I can say is,if you can't find something here that you would like, go home,empty handed and admit you have no taste. That's right, I threw the blame squarely on you! Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

They also do some really cool charity events on behalf of some great organizations. There's almost always something going on in the evenings -- live music, comedy shows, football games, game night, beer tastings.

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

The space is airy, has high ceilings, and gorgeous.   Being the soft opening, it looks like they are training some new people but they are nice as can be!

The outside patio \"pre-COVID\" had lots of games for guest to play. There's enough TV's to watch sports from anywhere you're sitting. I recommend ordering the fried chicken and homemade mash potatoes. I think it's their most popular dish. The dish is fried to the perfect level of crisp, and it's very juicy!  I also like their salmon!  As far as the drinks, if I'm not ordering my usual Austin Eastcider, I'm getting their jalapeño margarita! One of the best in town!   The vibes are always good here."

They have indoor seating and half outdoor seating (it's \"outside\" of the restaurant but still covered on all sides - great for when it's cold out!   It's a cool bar with live music and games but my favorite part is the food!   We got the cheese fondue that came with a bowl of pretzels and it was nothing I expected at all - pretzels are okay at best usually and most places has cheese that taste gross but this was the best pretzel/cheese combo I've ever had!! The pretzel balls were pretty big in size from what I was expecting, they were warm and perfectly seasoned and delicious! And then the cheese - wow I could literally drink a jar of it if I wasn't my age and getting heartburn everyday as is. I haven't stopped thinking about the pretzels and cheese since my first bite! I definitely want to go back to Austin just for this dish.   And then for entree my boyfriend and I split the butternut lasagna and they were so nice enough to split the dish for us without us having to ask.   Oh yeah and for drinks (I forgot to take a pic) but we got the Smashed Irishman and it was so good we ordered 5 through out dinner.   The staff was really nice and the place was super busy so some things took a little longer to come out and we were forewarned before ordering anyway."

I was happy to see CD had an Austin location!  We came on a week night and it was still pretty crowded. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so that gave us some time to walk around and do some window shopping at the Domain. Once we were seated, we put it our order right away.  Pretzels and Fondue: The softest pretzels!!! Perfect for dipping in the provolone cheese sauce. We actually got 2 rounds of these as they were that good.  El Matador: tequila, elderflower, ginger agave, and orange bitters. This is my favorite drink here. Has enough of a fruit taste without being overly sweet. And the bartender made it with a lot of love. Lol. Only 2 drinks and I was finished for the night.  Our server was really great and kept checking on us throughout the night. Fun crowd. Fun music. And a really fun time."

Brussel Sprouts (3/5): not crispy like I expected it to be but the flavor was solid and unique.  Salad (4/5): they made kale taste good. that's impressive!   36-hour Pork Ribs (3/5): very sauce-y and therefore, very messy. At least the flavor was decent. The ribs itself were are not very tender.   Steak Frites (3.5/5): not bad but also not great. The salad on the side was great tho.   Korean BBQ Skirt Steak (4/5): lots of flavorrrr. Better than the Steak Frites. The meats on these two dishes actually tasted the same but this one had sauce. I actually liked this main the most out of the ones that we tried!   Overall, chill spot for a nice dinner with friends. I would rate this place a 3/5 for the food but probably bump it up because of the ambiance. There's lots of space and a few games to play so the vibes probably make up for the food."

                "description": "Really good food, really hip atmosphere. My family enjoyed watching the food be prepared through the glass. We tried the burgers, the pork nachos, the salmon, and the kale salad. The Kale salad was incredible. I would have given a higher rating accept that it seemed our waiter forgot about us and we waited over 45 minutes for our food and appetizer. Otherwise, I think it is worth a try and the whole area of downtown Austin is great for kids."

                "description": "10-25-21  Quality/Quantity - Gochujang Brussels Sprout - I would have preferred the brussel sprouts to have been a little more crispy. Could not really taste the gochujang flavor, not spicy at all. Kurobuta Pork Ribs - My favorite, good flavor. Would have preferred more fries though. Spicy Vegan Curry - My daughter's choice, I guess it was good, but not something I would have ordered. Had a hint of lemon grass after taste, which is a little different from Indian or Thai Curry. Separated rice versus rice combined in the sauce is also preferred, so we can control the flavor.  Atmosphere - This is a very good spot. I like both the indoor and outdoor space. There were a few activities (cornhole, etc) for the guests. I like the choices of seating - regular tables, high top tables, bar seating, couches, etc. Additionally, your huge wrap around bar was nice. Lastly, I am always a fan of an open kitchen concept.  Service - Julia did a good job; she came back and refilled our water often. It was really busy and the entire team seemed to be working hard. I also noticed 2 employees picking up garbage as they walked back and forth serving customers, this is always a positive plus.  Price - $49.80 + tip  Owner Suggestion - Seems like you are very successful, owning quite a few restaurants. Congrats on all your success, and wish you many more. I look forward to trying your other restaurants in the future."

Here's what I tried: - Evil Jungle Princess ($13): This fruity rum drink was good! - Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($13.25): The pretzel bread was good. The cheese was good. $13.25 is a lot for what it is though. - Gojuchang Brussels Sprouts ($6): It maybe came with 5-6 total brussels sprouts. It tasted good, but super not worth it. - The M.A.C. Burger ($14.50): Their take on a McDonald's Big Mac. It was good!  Fun vibes. Convenient if you're staying in the Domain."

                "description": "Our experience eating at Culinary Dropout was nothing short of perfection. We went on a Monday night with all three of our very young kids. It was busy but there wasn't a wait if we wanted to sit outside. I was concerned because of how cold it was outside, but they assured us that the heating lamps outside kept it pretty comfortable so we could check and feel it out if we wanted. They were correct; between the heat lamps and the heated seating (amazing!), we faired well.   Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. He recommended his favorites to us and we took him up on them. I ordered the Spicy Korean Skirt Steak and my husband ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. They were both absolutely delicious. Like finger-licking good. I seriously can't wait to go back. I also love that they have a kids menu and are more than willing to bring the kids food out first if you ask! We will be returning to try the ribs soon!"

To my husband and my luck there were 2 seats open.  It was Sunday around 2ish and there was a guy singing with his guitar.  The speakers were amazing you can hear him inside and out on the patio.  Friendly staff. The food was so good. My husband and I are some carnivores but today we both ordered vegetarian options  Don't let that fool you. Both dishes were packed with flavor. My favorite was the vegetarian spicy curry. Holy cow was it good. So good. Would definitely visit again!!"

The restaurant is large and has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at around 5:45 on a weekday and did not have to wait to be seated.   I ordered the Fried Chicken and Between You and Me to drink. Both were delicious and definitely recommended. The portion sizes are large enough that I had leftovers. My friend ordered the Monkey Bread for dessert. It smelled delicious (and according to him tasted delicious) but I was too full for even another bite."

I recently went for brunch and we had cheeses, meat, and Brussels sprouts on ours. The Gochujang sauce on the Brussels is amazing. It's sweet and a little spicy. I could have eaten a whole order to myself, they were that good. I also loved the Wellness Retreat cocktail. It has a slight spice and it's a change up from just getting a mimosa."

The menu is a little thin, and our brunch items weren't anything special.   Service was top notch. We'd come back for happy hour, but probably not for a meal."

                "description": "We had been trying to get here for a while and we're excited to finally make it in. Unfortunately, we probably won't be returning.   Food: We ordered the pretzel fondue, the breakfast sandwich, the breakfast burrito, and the hash.   The pretzel fondue was 'meh' at best. The bread that came with it didn't really have that pretzel texture and very little salt. Provolone cheese is a pretty light tasty cheese so it didn't taste great as a fondue.   The other food items were great but all came out lukewarm or cold. Which, relates to the...  Service: It took a long time for the food to come out and my guess is that's why it was cold. Because it has taken so long to get there, we were too hungry to send it back.   The server was forgetful and/ or missed the details. For example, we had to ask three times for a bowl for the dog. Many servers just bring one out automatically when they see a doggo but, even if they don't, it doesn't take three reminders.   Overall, service was slow and not, well, service-oriented. For example, my friend and I both had coffee and my friend asked for a refill. The waitress stepped away and I assumed she was getting the pot for a refill. Nope. She came back with a new cup for my friend and took off. So, I'm sitting there looking at my bear empty cup. As someone who was a server for many years, it seems so obvious to me that you should ask the other person if they'd like coffee as well especially when it's near empty. That's just one example of the just miss when it comes to great service.   Other details: - The ambiance and big open patio was great which *may* pull me back for a drink or something. Then again, you can get the same at other places in the domain.  - They didn't offer corn tortillas which I feel is really strange. My friend has celiac's and can't do gluten but corn tortillas are fine. Since they didn't have corn tortillas (or a gluten free bread option) it limited her options significantly. Granted, they said they could do lettuce wraps but let's not pretend like that's the same.   I don't think I'll be returning to Culinary Dropout."

They had one vegan option - the spicy vegan curry which tasted like Thai curry. It was pretty yummy but the portion was not super filling for the price in my opinion, so my only wish is that there was more! Overall solid place for vegans and non vegans to enjoy a meal in the domain!"

Husky Filipino/ Hispanic bruh with a gray shirt and backwards cap. Never got his name because he was too busy looking pissed off at the world and just couldn't be bothered. Ordered two drinks, a beer and a cocktail. He poured the beer then asked for my card. I said \"Oh, I also had a whiskey\". He said \" I know\". Pretty rudely. Asked if I was starting a tab. I said \"No. I'll pay as I go\". Then not a word after. Now I work in the airline industry and have really thick skin. But, his attitude did not set well with me. Especially since his job includes tipping for service. Why cut your nose off despite your face?    Told my wife what had transpired. She went in to see for herself. Even she said he was rude.   But he had time to chat up regulars and a cute girl sitting at the end of the bar.   The only thing that salvaged the experience was the host for trivia night and the waitress working the outside patio. She had lots of people out there. Took care of all of us with a great attitude and friendliness.   Probably will not come back. Too bad. The place had potential."

The hot chocolate is a bit pricey ($4) but it's prepared with the espresso machine to froth the whipped cream directly, so it gives it a nice smooth feel that's quite a yummy experience.  Their outdoor seating was pretty full, so we opted to sit indoors and take one of the corner booths where there were pillows to cozy up on. The outdoor deck is really nice, positioned under a grand oak tree with lots of string lighting, along with a long firepit for cooler weather! Get there early before dusk to secure yourself a spot, is my advice.  While there are a few deli sandwiches and the like to partake in, this joint is mainly a bar with a variety of drinks. Scan the QR code to view on your phone and order with the guy behind the counter.  The inside decor rocks the industrial vibe that's become so in fashion currently. Bathrooms are clean and well-stocked."

All of the other bartenders/servers were absolutely delightful and I hate for this to make them look bad.   Here's the thing, I have worked in customer service and in the industry for a long time, I get it, some days SUCK, but the way that this young lady was acting was unacceptable and I agree that she does not belong in customer service. I also agree that Nates is losing money and customers because of her.   I hope that she finds another industry that she enjoys, because clearly this isn't it and her tone clearly states it."

The real reason we came and why we'll come back: the Bartenders. They are friendly and know what they are doing. Well crafted original and classic cocktails. We threw a few obscure requests their way and they made perfect drinks without having to consult the \"googles.\" That will always get my crowd to become loyal repeat patrons."

                "description": "I can't believe I hadn't been to Nate's before now! It was less than 10min from my apartment off of Slaughter previously and now 5min from my house. So you could say this will definitely be my new home away from home (watch out Target).  Their deck is the huge selling point for me! It is huge with a beautiful tree for shade. There are all sorts of seating arrangement options from comfy outdoor chairs and couches to metal chairs and tables and the bonus of the long gas fire pit. At night, there are beautiful light up stars hanging from the tree that adds to the ambiance. I love that it feels like you are just hanging in your backyard with a couple of friends. Every time I have been, I have left with new friends. It might be the small town feel that makes everyone nice. The drink prices are another reason I keep on coming back! Their beers are such a great deal. I love that I can go out with a couple of friends, have a couple of beers, and not break the bank."

I have lived in Buda for several years and make an effort to support local businesses but I have tried Nate's 3 times now and every single time the same bartender has the WORST attitude and has ruined my night out for the last time.  The first couple of times I just brushed it off but he seriously is so foul and unwelcoming that I can't stand going there.  He not only has been rude to me, but also my family members, and most recently friends visiting from out of town.    Management- if you want people to frequent your business, get rid of staff that obviously hate their job."

When I first moved here from south Austin I was very worried I wouldnt have a bar close by that could meet my high standards. The staff at Nates really know what they are doing. The drink specials are fantastic and creative. They make an amazing Sazerac, which is really hard to come by in these parts. I also really love their Mexican Martinis, The Last Word, and house made Lemoncello! My only critical feedback is that sometimes the guy bartenders aren't very friendly and welcoming. But the ladies are always super sweet."

Went for Maddie gras this past February and it was crowded and still tons of fun. Great event-themed cocktails and great bartenders that know what they're doing. The cuvée coffee isn't my thing but it appears to be a big hit with other people! Had some cake balls while enjoying my fruity cocktail that was delicious and beautifully decorated. Nate's is a solid local bar for hang out time with friends, casual trivia game playing and for unwinding after a stressful day."

I've seen some people bring pizza on the patio from an outside restaurant but not sure if that was technically allowed.   I get the drink special every time and so far I've never been disappointed. Been about 3 times and I'd say the only thing \"bland\" is the service. I hate to say it but my service experience every single time was less than friendly. Not rude but.... just not welcoming. Which is sad since this place is so awesome. It's not bland enough to keep me coming back, just hope they see this and take it as constructive feedback and hopefully improve!!! I think the girls have been more friendly than the guys.   Either way, 4 stars! YUM."

Nate's could be described as country chic meets 21st century industrial look.  The 3-4ish times I've been have been exceptional. Not only is the staff fantastic but if you ask nicely, the staff will share their beverage and beverage history with you.  Nate, Shelly and Clarie are personable and what the ideal bar staff should be: professional,  knowledgeable yet friendly and engaging.  If anything, their old fashioned is a must; best I've had.   While they do not have a kitchen, they do offer snacks.  These are brought in daily from local businesses  (sandwiches, salads, etc.) They do have meat and cheese trays they make there which are made with quality meat and cheeses. The selection changes daily so check the counter (immediately as you come in) for what they have available.  18 craft beers on tap and craft cocktails? Buda, you're soon becoming my favorite non metroplex destination.  Muah!"

I'm not familiar with the area but this place is gorgeous. It has an outside patio area that is really nice. The place was crowded outside. It was busy inside too but there was lots of seating available.   I had a drink Knights of Ni and it was delicious!! I'm glad I listened to the recommendation and gave it a try. Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely hang out here again!"

They have reposted my pictures on social media and allowed a close friend to film a short film there for free. The beers are unique and delicious, with lots of options on tap! They have nightly specials and events, all of which are fun! For example trivia on mondays and Thursday, and they have little long horn saloon come do chicken shit bingo once a month there as well. At one point I was going every week for the Tuesday 99c east coast oysters. Among many other specials. There has been some miscommunication in the past with showing games but the manager working at the time is always very quick to help out. For example none of the TVs had sound on when they advertised they all did, there was confusion inside but the manager was outside and apologized and immediately turned on the sound inside and changed to social media to reflect inside. I also noticed that someone had paid to play the juke box and he paused their songs and gave them a free beer for rhe inconvenience. The dog park is also very nice and spacious and the new beer patio is very well put together! I am looking forward to live music!   Unrelated to Celis itself, but Black draft pizza truck is good there but overpriced. I am excited to try the new con todo truck!"

This place should be pretty chill - there's nine people here either chatting (or trying to) or working as I type - but they're blasting the music as always. It's kind of bizarre, doesn't fit the vibe, but they always do it. Thus I knocked off a star.  Look for oyster nights, a real highlight here."

They were blaring music so loud - outside - that we couldn't have a conversation across the table. Every customer looked like they were only there for Instagram pictures and the perfume was so thick you could see it hanging in the air. The waitress inside is ummm... dressed to get big tips. Ahem. Then you go back to the outdoor concert area, and it's a lot of families with kids and regular people. Weird. Beer was okay, but after the cloud of perfume I was honestly too sick to drink. Maybe someday I'll come back and avoid the front entirely. Then I went to cash out and the walking cloud of perfume was in front of me in line."

Celis, as y'all know, is an Austin institution- steeped in history, the first craft brewer to bring Belgian beer to the craft world in ATX (I think), so y'all can rest knowing that their wheat beers are AWESOME.  The tap room is large, airy, albeit a little dimly lit. There's patio seating outside and get this- DOGS ALLOWED INSIDE AND OUT!   They also welcome kids! Actually I think everyone is welcome here. It's one of the friendlier breweries in ATX IMHO.  We've visited almost every Sunday during covid and I can say that they're taking every precaution. There's live music on the weekends from 6-9pm.  Beer wise - I like the options. If you're a sour beer connoisseur, you'll enjoy the raspberry sour. Light beer? Lo Lo Lager. Safe, easy drinking? Celis White.  I know this place has had its ups and down but as Austinites, we need to show support to our local businesses and just be cool with each other."

The gentleman who served us our beers was also very friendly.   The beers were all very good and we enjoyed our flights.  Sometimes new breweries take time to develop a good list of beers, but I was impressed.   The setting was nicely laid out and decorated.  Indoor seating with AC for those hot days, as well as outdoor seating.   Check out Vacancy and support local independent breweries!!"

They  had staples like a Pilsner, or you can try something a little different like the sparkling golden ale (IMO heavy on the brut flavor). They have seating inside as well as outside, and they're dog friendly! They also had some cute shirts/apparel with their logo on it for purchase. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying this place once they expand their selection a little bit, but overall it was good! It's also right down the way from St Elmos Brewing, so add it to your list and hit them up when you're in the area/getting your beer fix."

The mix paired really well and each drink would be the equivalent of a $16+ cocktail if I'd had it at most Austin establishments.

My best friend was visiting from out of town during the holidays,. We took her there and she fell in love with the Nutty Valentine (extra pecans). She requested that we go there a second time before she was going to fly back. We of course, happily obliged! My go to is the nutty valentine with a topping of pecans, my son loves the black out, and my husband loves the black betty with icing on the side.  We hope to try the savory donuts the next time we're there, it's just so hard to decide between sweet or savory!"

The wait staff was super nice and helpful.    The menu is also amazing - so many thing we wanted to try. We went for the fried green tomatoes, the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the country fried chicken. When our food arrived everything was beautiful. Really great presentation. But unfortunately when we tasted it we were in for a big disappointment. Everything just tasted like salt. The flavors of the toppings and donuts all just blended together with nothing interesting or any pops of fresh flavor. I will say everything was cooked to perfection, but the flavor was just off/missing.   Bummer."

We didn't get a phone signal inside for the contactless menus, so we asked for three physical ones, and she came back with two and said \"is two okay\"? She only had three tables total to work, and we saw her on her phone quite a bit. After waiting about thirty minutes to order, she finally came up and as we were ordering, she rolled her eyes and walked away. It was clear she wanted us to leave, so we did.   I understand being short-staffed, but again she only had three tables to work. All in all, terrible."

Wrap them in donut dough, aka The Big Cheez.   How do you make a breakfast sandwich better?  Serve it on donuts.  The McGourdough is maple sausage, egg, and cheese (on donuts, of course) with maple on the side (opted not to have the pour-over). There's plenty of maple flavor in the sausage so I never used the side of maple syrup.   Once again, how do you make Kolaches better?  You guessed it, use donut dough, aka Gotchie Yo Kolache  And finally, is it even possible to make a Cuban sandwich even better?  Yup! The Cubano, a Cuban sandwich on donuts.   I'm shocked that they didn't figure out how to serve me my beer in a donut!  That's right, a full-bar to go with all that doughy goodness!  Donuts and alcohol, what more do you need?"

The description state \"crispy fried fillet chicken breast smothered in honey butter.\"  I did request to have the honey butter on the side. I got two chicken tenders instead of a chicken breast (not to be too critical but the description should be updated if chicken breast = chicken tenders). The honey butter sauce was not what I was expecting; (not a fan). On the bright side, the donut was pretty good. Even thought it wasn't a chicken breast,  the tenders were tasty and had a good crunch.   I did order the miss shortcake and it was pretty good. But nothing special I suppose. Maybe I'll try a sandwich instead so get a full experience. I'll try them again and see if I get a different experience."

Smells super weird in there Idk if I'm smelling old oil or what but it's weird.  2. There are lots of people working here, yet getting service or someone's attention was hard. We were approached when we first walked in and then after that, it was half assed.  3. I got the cucumber mint drink and it's like a mojito but with rum and cucumber instead of mint. Wasn't my fave, wasn't sweet enough, just tasted like cucumber water and lime juice.  4. Our donuts were really good but I was told by my friend that they were smaller than the donut food truck which is disappointing.  I got the sin a bomb and it tasted just like a cinnamon roll. My friends got the cherry bombs and peach donut and we all enjoyed it!  5. Vibes were just off and my friends agreed. If you're looking for good food, sure, but if you're a vibes type person like us, you'll feel weird here lol."

                "description": "Was super excited when I heard about Gourdough's and they did not disappoint. We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress was super nice in getting us situated and being patient with us when we were figuring out our order.  There's plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors with additional bar seating. Lots to offer in terms of a drink menu with beer on tap too. Since it was the middle of the day, we opted not to drink though since there was still plenty on the menu for the day.  For food we got the GPH Mother Clucker (not pictured),  Blue Balls (front), Son of a Peach (middle), and Granny's Pie (back). Would hands down come again for the Mother Clucker. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and it paired so well with they honey and donut with it. Between all of the donuts, I think the Blue Balls were my favorite because the blueberry sauce wasn't all that sweet and more on the tangier side so it wasn't like I was getting a total sugar high like I did with the other two. I did love all three, just the donut holes a little more. As a side note, the menu says those donut holes are supposed to be blueberry filled but ours came with a blueberry sauce on top. Nothing wrong with that, but for future customers looking to try, it's worth knowing.  In terms of price, everything may look expensive, but the portion sizes that go with those prices are definitely reasonable. Plus, the donuts are made fresh and cooked to perfection, so (again) the prices are justified and reasonable for what you get. Almost everything on the menu is also shareable if you're interested in trying a bunch of things without a singular price tag.  Definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for a place to eat all your calories and try a bunch of different donut dishes. Will be coming again the next time I come to Austin!"

                "description": "The donuts here never disappoint! They are so good and delicious. I usually get the black out but this time I got the miss shortcake which was delicious and wasn't too excessive like the black out can be. Excellent dessert spot for sure. The reason I'm giving it four stars is because we had to wait roughly 40-45 minutes to get three donuts? That seems a little excessive especially since they did not seem to be understaffed. And when the donuts came out they felt lukewarm like they had been sitting out for 10+ min which is a bit disappointing. Maybe there was something extra going on which is why I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Great taste which is why I recommend it but maybe just go to the food truck next time?   Overall: 3.9 stars"

The chips were kinda not enough for the dip but it was good cause if you got a meal you could use the dip as little kick it up.  The coffee cocktails were the bomb dot com."

                "description": "One of the must do's in Austin. Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, arrived at around 11:30am and did not need to wait for a table. The place has a fairly large outdoor seating area that is super dog friendly. Parking however, is limited. They have a small lot in front of the restaurant for maybe 10 cars. Otherwise, it's street parking, which is also limited.   The food was 10/10! Tried the Rise and Shine, which is one of their most popular brunch items. The chicken is thick and crispy. The egg and quest were perfect. And I am a huge fan of the pickled jalapeños (on top) too. The El Diablo was delicious too, not spicy at all. Also appreciated the huge portions.   Overall, loved my experience here and will certainly come back to try more!"

They also have a good truck in another location, but the menu is more limited (and they don't have the Freebird sadly).   There's plentiful patio seating so if you prefer sitting outdoors, they've got you covered.  They serve both sweet and savory donuts, and they also have a big selection of drinks (although I've never ordered any of them)."

                "description": "Made a stop here for Happy Hour while visiting friends in Austin this weekend and was so glad we did! We came mid-afternoon and were seated immediately without reservations. We started with drinks. I had the Losoya Street Lemonade, and I loved it! It was sweet and tart and not overpowering at all! We also ordered a Water Moccasin Fishbowl. Fair warning, this one was  very sweet! Good but sweet - reminded us of a blue sour patch kid.  After we made a small dent in the fishbowl, we ordered our doughnuts. We tried the Sin A Bomb and the Heavenly Hash. The Heavenly Hash definitely took the trophy between the two. The doughnut itself was amazing (tastes like funnel cake), but the toppings were even better - fudgy chocolate brownie icing, rich chocolate chips, marshmallow cream, brownie batter drizzle... oh my.... It was so sweet and chocolatey, and we finished it QUICK!! The Sin A Bomb was good as well, but the butter on top was a bit too much for us. If we had ordered it with just the cream cheese topping and not the slew of melted butter, I think we would have liked it more. Not bad by any means, just not our cup of tea.  We never felt rushed and sat their enjoying our doughnuts and drinks (and attempting to make it through the fishbowl) for several hours. It was a super laid-back atmosphere and the perfect place to catch up with old friends. In fact, we were there so long that we got hungry again and ended up ordering mac and cheese - which was also amazing! You can see we are the picture of health going from doughnuts to mac and cheese, ha! I wouldn't come here if you are on a diet... everything on the menu is either a rich dessert or a loaded Southern dish. Would love to go back and try some of the food items like the Chicken Pot Pie or Burgers. Everything that the people around us were ordering looked delicious."

                "description": "One of the best \"better\" burgers in Austin.  Plain and simple.    It's a bit hard to find from Lamar because it's semi-hidden in the Midtown Commons apartment complex.  Like the Triangle and most other new Austin developments, there's retail and restaurants on the ground floor.  Decided to drop in here tonight because the burger came highly recommended.  I'm definitely glad I tried it.  The burger is deceptively small.  It looks like a smaller burger, but the density of the high quality burger patty combined with their bun makes it more than a meal.  Don't forget their fries, which were described to me as English style chips.  The fries look like flattened steak fries and are exceptionally crispy.  I'm not sure what the seasoning is, but it's strangely addictive.  Black Star has a huge variety of beers for the drinkers.  For the non-drinkers, they have a variety of canned and bottled soft drinks, although no fountain drinks.    Being a co-op, the service is friendly and obviously takes a lot of pride in their pub.  The quality of the food and the service both show that."

Pups have to stay outdoors, but you're allowed to bring them indoors to place your order. They have tons of beer options, great in-house brews. I was floored by their options! I always go for the flight when I try a new brewery to get a better taste of what they offer. I loved pricing: 4 for $10, and my favorites were the Island Baby (pineapple what!!) and juicy Fructis hazy IPA. They had a bit of everything, so that's always nice for beer geeks. Quench my palate, Black Star! They have their beer menu overhead--super easy to read. They also have great happy hour, but we arrived later after it was over. The food menu is on the paper menu that they have at the front of the line. Grab yourself the menu while someone stands in line for ya!   They also offer food specials for that day. It looked good--I think it was some sort of tofu (veg) tacos, but I wanted fries...so went with their avocado club. It was a bit heavy on the mayo, but it tasted great. Their chips...crisps...fries whatever you want to call em were the REAL WINNER. Y'all. Fries are so crispy and uneven...wedge-style. BUT not dry or lukewarm. They are delicious. I would go back just for their addictive fries. Trust me. They also offer the impossible burger too for veg folks, and other options like grilled cheese. I just love how veg-friendly they are. THANK Y'ALL. Grilled cheese gets old for us who don't eat meat.   The atmosphere is very chill and with a darker ambiance. It seems like the perfect spot for group hangs or a relaxed date. Parking was easy, especially since there's a customer parking structure that's free. It's also close to public transportation if you choose to take it. I love this spot--I can see this becoming a new favorite."

I make an exception for this location due to the fantastic service I am given every. single. time. (NO TIPS HERE!! They work and treat you well because thy are paid good/decent wages!!!!!!)  Atmosphere: 4 Pretty big, can get crowded on evenings (cause it's freakin great). Lots of indoor seating and ample outdoor seating (covered)  Food: 4.5 Most of the food I have had here has been pretty decent. I knock off half a star because I've noticed a slight inconsistency in the servings (read about fish and chips) Fish and chips: my go-to food. Usually comes with 2-3 strips of fish and the potato wedges/strips are always well cooked, and come it's this out-of-the-world sauce!! Addicting af but wish they would consistently give 3 strips of fish ): Fried avocado tacos: awesome!! Sounds like it would be plain, but came with these giant thicc bacon strips on it that really added the savory taste Cheese board: nice variety, definitely love that the cheese is locally sourced from Antonelli's! Good mix for everyone's taste buds and really liked how there was plenty of bread too. Ice cream: seasonal flavors but I tried the pecan and regretted only having one scoop.  Service: 5 The servers here are always!!!!!!!!! SO cool and nice and helpful. Whenever we need drink recs, or anything at all, they are there to help! Even called in to ask if they were playing a game before, and offered to put down the big screen to have us come by and watch as we ate."

We split the tofu tikka masala and buffalo cauliflower (we added bleu cheese). I'm sure I could've eaten the whole bowl of of buffalo cauliflower by myself. It was super tasty. The sauce was just a little bit vinegary and the cauliflower soaked up all the flavor. Get it with the cheese, if you aren't vegan. It gives it that extra sharpness. The tikka masala was a bit spicy. I was surprised by that. We both liked it. The tofu was perfect with it. You have to know how to do tofu just right, and this was it! Everything was gluten free, for my friend. I can't wait to go back after I have my baby so I can partake in the adult beverages. I had my eye on some that they made there."

Foodwise, the only things I've liked are the chicken snack, and the seasoned chips. The burger is just okay, but the fish for the fish and chips needs salt and let's get some dang tarter sauce. They serve it with an aoli, which lacks seasoning. A side of coleslaw would go a long way too.  I'd be back, primarily for a cold one, and I would not not go for food again, but not by my will."

Their beer selection is great, with a wide variety of beer made in house and other local breweries. The food selection leaves a little bit to be desired. The season chips were delicious, they reminded me more of steak fries if you put them in a broiler to give them a nice crunch. Besides the chips nothing on the menu really stood out to me as too interesting, and most of the reviews I read were pretty disappointed with their other food.   They also seem to have events  and good happy hour deals pretty frequently during the week. Overall, it's a good place to grab a beer in the area and enjoy a nice night outside, but I wouldn't come here too hungry."

                "description": "Visited Odd Duck after months of waiting for a reservation, and was met with food and service that went above and beyond expectations. A local farm to table establishment with an elevated twist, I highly recommend Odd Duck as a go-to spot in Austin.   As many other Yelpers have surely noted, Odd Duck's menu is seasonal, so I'll spare you the details regarding the food I ate, as the menu has most likely changed. Feel free to sit back and trust your waiter's suggestions, as they are veterans of their craft.   One thing that I would like to commend Odd Duck on is their extreme attention to detail, which was immediately noticeable to me. From their unique plates and cutlery to the maintenance of their restrooms, this dining experience made it well worth the price point. Additionally, our waiter made it a point to clean our table throughout the meal, which was awesome.  5/5"

                "description": "1,000x yes, go eat here.  Odd Duck was a \"must eat at\" stop on a specially curated visit to Austin. It is a fun, quirky, farm to table, seasonal and special menu kind of place, with a lovely team of staff and cooks. A team running a dream.  We sat at the bar and our bartender/waitress was super friendly and attentive - we were chugging water since Austin heat is ridiculous compared to New York heat, so she kept us hydrated as we waited for our food. She helped us work through our order and recommended some items and how much food to order since the menu is set up in a specific way with some featured small and shared plates.   As each dish was served, the server explained the dish, which I loved. It made the experience that much better to know the unique aspects of each dish like where the ingredients came from or how to enjoy it best.  Everything was delicious, and yes, the rave reviews of the cornbread are totally accurate.  10/10 stars for sure"

                "description": "Pictures of menu on August 17, 2021. Reservations are strongly recommended as this place is quite popular (rightfully so though)! We picked the tomatoes, quail, and cornbread and everything was 10/10. I don't typically eat cornbread but theirs is MAGICAL and a must do! Their service was also A+, they were kind enough to mark the menu with vegetarian options, they even provided ways to alter some of their dishes to make them vegetarian (see photo). The French Toast dessert was also a delight. I'm a big fan of their rotating menus and will happily return to try more.   There is complimentary valet parking. You can also find street parking by the restaurant. They have happy hour 5-6pm daily with drink specials only."

                "description": "Odd Duck is an OG in ATX's food scene; I've known about it since undergrad (10+ years now!) but haven't had a chance to try it until I was in town recently for work.   Before local/farm2table was cool - Odd Duck was doing it. It still feels great to support local farmers and producers though.   The food here was OUTSTANDINGLY flavorful -- bringing it to that edge but showing finesse and balance. I also appreciate that they made vegetarian versions of certain dishes so there are some options for Vegs!   My only regret? Not coming here sooner!   The menu will be different when you visit, but we thoroughly enjoyed each dish! We had the:  *Redfish Ceviche (leche de tigre, persimmon, cucumber, potato chip) *Cajun Pork Rillette (apples, pickles, Sour Duck Market sourdough toast) *Dry-aged wagyu burger (pimento, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion ring) - like an EXPLOSION of flavor.  *Wagyu Sirloin Cap (beef fat papas bravas, soubise, green bean salsa verde)  *French Toast (Vanilla Ice Cream, Cajeta, Apple, Pecan, Brown Butter Cereal) - yes, we had French Toast for dessert! So good and I recall just a pinch of salt from keeping it from being overly sweet!"

                "description": "A gem in Austin for their authenticity and willingness to explore.   I loved dining at Odd Duck so much that I'd say it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Austin (first time was earlier this month). I'd go through all the dishes but that wouldn't be helpful because the menu changes seasonally (since they are a farm-to-table restaurant +1). First, I love that it's tapas styled (+1) because it means you get to try more dishes and nottt feel like you're over ordering!   What stands out to me about this restaurants is their sauces. The ones that I had with the heavier items (the red meat dishes) were rich and dimensional. Some of the flavors were unique because it had some aspects of familiar tastes mixed with ones that were foreign to me. I loved being able to try all the dishes because I knew I was tasting a unique dish that was created (or crafted) by a talented chef.   From a bar seat, I could tell that the servers and chef love what they're doing (trust me, it doesn't go unnoticed). I love knowing that my meal was made by people who are exploring, learning, and having fun! I honestly think it's hard to NOT want to support a restaurant like this..   Every foodie's must-try for sure."

She created customized menus for each person indicating what they could/could not eat and even came back with variations of dishes the chefs said they could do. The service here is excellent, as was the food.  Food is tapas style, so we were ordering tons of dishes for the table. Their menu changes frequently, so what you get really depends on when you go. Overall, we had a great time here and would love to come back!"

                "description": "Odd Duck is definitely a must-visit if you are in Austin!  This restaurant supports the local Austin community, so it is neat seeing the various sourced goods within the innovative dishes here. It started in a trailer but transformed into what it is today with its farm to table creations.  We found street parking luckily, which was right on Gibson Street W. I did notice there is a private parking lot with valet included in it. I highly recommend making reservations. I found my reservation about ~3 days prior to the date. There are bar top seatings and outdoor seatings available. It's great for dates, friends or family (more for adults).  FOOD: Cajun Pork Rillette (4/5; Apples, Pickles, Sour Duck Market Sourdough): The cajun pork rillette was decent but enhanced with the addition of the veggies. The pickled veggies brought life to the dish. It was my first time trying rillette though, which is pork meat that is submerged in fat then cooked at an extremely slow rate. Another important note was the sourdough (it was baked perfect).  Mushroom Chorizo Tostada (5/5; Squash and Pepita Butter, Radish, Pickled Onions): This tostada was something else! It is very unique, and I loved all of it (including the texture of the tostada). There are 3 pieces, but I ate 2/3. I could have ordered another one for myself. The squash and pepita butter had some flavor, which helped bring another part of the taste element into play. Nothing overpowered another.  Apple Salad (4/5; Smoked Squash, Lavender, Chevre, Black Pepper Pecans): This is a lighter dish. I am not a big fan of apples, but I can assure you that I ate them in this salad! Great flavors that burst in your mouth... even the black pepper pecans.   Wagyu Sirloin Cap (5/5; Papa Bravas, Soubise, Green Bean Salsa Verde): My date loved this. He is an all time meat-lover, and he raved about this. The wagyu was cooked perfectly at medium-rare. It easily became one of my top 5. I also have to mention the pickled veggies with the papa bravas because they were delicious. I did not try much of the soubise (white onion sauce), but it was not overpowering. It added a nice, subtle savory taste with the wagyu.   Service was great and attentive. Everything came out on time. Our drinks never touched bottom.  Would I come back!? Definitely!!! They change the menu pretty often too. I am a fan."

We were greeted immediately by the hosts and taken inside. The drinks were amazing. we ordered cornbread to go since we heard such amazing things but I wanted to try so many things on the menu and there were only 2 mouths to feed.   Unfortunately no duck egg for the dinner menu.  We got the wagyu beef which was slightly a bit more raw then I would have liked it.   Drinks were pretty good with the Cucumber Daze and a watermelon drink (can't recall it was one of their seasonal drinks)"

I had the pleasure of trying the ceviche, cornbread, scallop, and wagyu steak dishes here and each dish blew me away with the creative fusion of flavors.  The pacing that the food was brought out was perfect, leaving just enough time to digest and converse between bites. I honestly was expecting the place to be a bit fancier on the interior given the price point and exterior, however, the quirky decor meshed perfectly with the spirit of the restaurant.  Our server was very attentive and made sure that we were taken care of, and carefully explained each dish, and gave suggestions for the best way to consume them. My personal favorite was the ceviche - although it wasn't traditional, it was one of the best that I've had - the flavors were phenomenal! Please get this if they have a variation of it on the menu.  I'm so excited to come back here again as they change their menu every month so there is always something new to look forward to!"

The meat was stringy and hard, not at all what wagyu meat should be.The ceviche was a bite size with what looked and tasted like Lays barbecue potato chips. The worst experience in Austin. The lemon dessert was not tasty even for a dessert lover. It  was just like a bowl of sugar. The lemon cake was dry and the sorbet was just ok really no satisfaction. So disappointed because it had great reviews, but don't waist your money!I was so looking forward to supporting local restaurants especially farm to table, but after telling my waitress Rochelle that the wagyu was not great and seeing how she did not care makes me not want to try a different local restaurant tomorrow!"

After booking I was super excited to hear my colleague confirm that it was a great choice.   We sat at the bar as it was the only thing available a week out when I booked. We took our servers recommendations for the most part. We tried a little bit of everything. Staff was super friendly and even more knowledgeable about every dish. A random runner, manager, chef would deliver a plate and explain in great detail. Watching the cook work the live fire oven was fun and seeing the Waygu sirloin caps getting seared made the mouth water.   Sadly, I'm coming off COVID snd my taste wasn't there as I would have liked but my foodie friend said everything was a 10!"

Love this place because it's farm fresh to table but also just really unique dishes with unexpected ingredients like peach kimchi in the pork loin dish or green chili in cornbread with green garlic butter. Even the drinks have unique ingredients and nice twists.   We made reservations same day on our want to Austin. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so nice and even made us some special cocktails not on menu.   We had: -cast iron cornbread. Seriously the best corn bread I've ever had. That green chili was such a unique and pleasant touch and the butter was amazing. It was so moist and the salt bits at the bottom were heavenly.  -the pork loin was so tender. I've never had pork a medium or light pink and got a little scared but was reassured this is normal way to cook pork so it's not too dry. Wow I've had pork all wrong all these years. It was so good and the little touches like kimchi peach, the mushrooms and the mole sauce were all just amazing.  -panna cotta was so unique because it had a torched marshmallow on top, graham crackers, mint, and rose petals. So delicious and great \"light\" way to end dinner. There's always room for dessert no matter how full you are, right?   Make reservations especially if you want a sit down table and not bar top. Love this place, now on my list of recos."

We were seated at a bar-side table height space where we enjoyed the show of the busy kitchen- and it was a very interesting experience! If you are 2 and up to something different and into cooking: this is the one table for you!  So I posted a couple of pictures of the view of the kitchen... but here is the drink and food review!  We got 2 cocktails : The prickly pear margarita had a bitter after taste that I just had to work through (lol yes I finished it) and the other one was a (something in the bag) sweet and delicious vodka concoction: Reccommend! Then we got 2 appetizers the babaganoush and the nachos..: the babaganoush was green. It was interesting but... mostly tasted of a pea purée. It came with pickled squash that was sweet and delish and some pickled okra that was unexpectedly good! The bread was incredible. The best. The baba was different... Then we got the chicken nachos that were 4 very loaded and flavor nachos. They were very good- it was beautifully stewed or braised or whatever they did to the chicken was lovely! Lol. We were full after but had to had to taste this specialty I've cream we were privy to: an off the menu scoop of vanilla milk tea ice cream served with peach compote and brown butter cereal crunchies: our favorite part! Over all we had a great experience and the table by the kitchen offered us an intimate view of each dish as it was prepared and presented before being sent to the table!  What FUN!! Ask for this table! Apparently they take reservations and we just got lucky today  Enjoy."

The menu here rotates monthly with whatever ingredients that might be in season, and flavors are punchy and inventive. All the dishes I ordered were excellent, and I only regret that I could not have tried more  The restaurant itself has a few different seating configurations - you can sit at the bar and watch the chef's in action, or do individual tables.  The cast iron cornbread was an excellent starter with crunchy, caramelized edges and the leek butter gave it a bit of a fresh vegetal touch. The marinated cucumber and watermelon salad with fish sauce and cashews evokes Thai papaya salad flavors.  I really liked the delicacy of the fried whole quail, but especially the creamed corn sauce that came with it. The aged pork loin was stellar - it made pork taste like high quality beef, and all of the little garnishes topped off the dish, the black garlic pecan mole was so flavorful.

The building was nice, but wasn't what I was expecting.   The vibe here is great. A lot of young professionals clearly \"working from home\" but needed to get out of the house for a few hours. Very friendly customers and staff.   I ordered a vanilla latte and it came out wonderful. They had an awesome selection of beers on tap if that's your thing.   If I am in the area I will definitely be back for a visit."

I've been here a few times over the past years and it's a really cute, quiet spot for working. Today however I was served a matcha latte with a really funky taste to it. It seemed like the matcha powder used just sat in a thick later on top of the (1%) milk, without being well combined, and the milk tasted a little off to be honest. I regret not saying something but I think I attributed the taste to the matcha mixing issue at the time. The person I went with had a coffee which tasted fine, but used a different (dairy) milk from mine. Really a shame since my drink was so bad from the first sip, we just ended up leaving. Sorry stouthaus!"

The outdoor seating is very spacious but it's pretty loud with the cars zooming past us.   The pumpkin spice latte was okay. Not amazing. My friend says her cappuccino is just like any other.  The WiFi is solid. There are real and fake outlets (literally a sticker on the wall lol). It's a nice place to work or study. I like the temperature and the music is an okay volume.   I'd come back!"

I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to order right away! I got an iced cinnamon sugar latte with almond milk which came out to about $6.25. The price is a little steep, but the flavor and milk substitute added about $2.   The coffee came out relatively fast and was pretty good! The cinnamon was subtle, but the coffee was smooth and rich. My fiancé and I both enjoyed it! I don't know if I would come out of my way for this coffee, but if I was in the area I would definitely stop by again!   The location is convenient and there are other businesses on the same strip to try out as well. I would recommend coming here and getting some coffee to go!"

Cappuccino was good but little thin, coffee was pretty good, cinnamon roll was just ok.  Overall, definitely worth a visit and really appreciate the way they're handling the business in pandemic!"

It's pretty small inside, so if it's cold outside I wouldn't plan on finding a seat, but their patio is a nice addition with a beer garden feel. It is right off the highway though so don't go expecting a nice view of trees, but with the right company I don't think that really matters.  When I went the coffee didn't blow my mind, and they also didn't have any brewed at 1pm on a Thursday which was kind of strange to me for a coffeehouse so I had to wait. But that did mean it was fresh which is always nice.   They have fake outlets (they're stickers) which is kind of funny I guess but wasn't funny to me when I found a seat and my laptop died... they also have real ones though so don't worry.   All in all a cute little place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a new local coffee shop. Or a low key place for a beer."

They have a dedicated parking lot that makes visiting it so much easier and less stressful than many of the other coffee shops in the area. It has a decent number of plugs and space to get work done as well as a covered outdoor area. The one thing I don't like is that their chairs are not very comfortable when you're sitting in them for several hours getting work done. Even so, I think this is one of the best coffee shops in Austin!"

The outdoor patio has potential, but it seems to have been neglected. The few times I've sat outside I think the wait staff forgot about us. Not a huge deal, and they made it right with a feee pizza voucher.   All their pizzas are good and worth trying, but my go to is the pepperoni and basil."

While it's certainly not the best brewery selection/pizza in Austin, it definitely more than hits the spot! Pizza is a tad on the roughies/chewy side, not too much of a char or crisp as I'd like but some people might prefer that! Fun topping varieties, although I'd stick to the classics, our cauliflower pesto pizza fell a little short flavor wise."

                "description": "Pros: - Lively ambiance - Lots of seating - You get your food pretty quickly - Pizza is cooked really well, the crust is as soft as a cloud on the inside with a nice, not too chewy or tough exterior - The classic pies have great flavor and ingredient combos, definitely try them even if something seems out of your comfort zone  Cons: - Might be hard to find group seating since the tables inside are bench seating, similar to long picnic tables - Parking may not be available  If you are going on a typically busy time and day of the week, call ahead of time and ask about the wait time"

                "description": "dank.   The Honey Pear pizza is a must try if you've never had it. The subtle sweetness of the honey and pear matched perfectly with the house cheese blend that Pinthouse uses. With some caramelized onions to top it all off, it was a great medley of flavors that paired nicely with the prosciutto.  Personally being a fan of meat-lover pizzas, we ordered the Cannonball as well. Typically, I find these types of pizzas to be a little heavy when it comes to oil and grease, but this wasn't the case for Pinthouse. The pizza was sparing with the oil, but still contained the substance you would be looking for. After eating 6-7 slices myself, I somehow didn't end up in a food-induced coma and even managed to shoot around for a bit afterwards.   Overall, great experience. 5 stars - will be returning"

Pinthouse Pizza is the common ground for a polarized world. It's where men with beards, and men with longer beards can come together and poorly explain Bitcoin to each other over a delicious glass of Electric Jellyfish. It's where women with wide-brimmed hats and nose rings can talk trash about Nicole. Grab a friend and go to Pinthouse. Support local businesses and tip well.

                "description": "A great place for a casual get-together for unique pizza and drinks!  FOOD: Their \"El Queso\" (basically chips and queso) was delicious and a hearty appetizer for 2-3 people. My friend and I also ordered small sizes of the Banh Mi and Shroomin' Goat pizzas to share. The Banh Mi was alright - not amazing, but perhaps that is why Banh Mis are meant to be sandwiches. Beware: the Banh Mi has jalapeno slices on it that make the pizza very spicy, unless you're into that. The Shroomin' Goat is a balance of mushroom, salty goat cheese, fresh arugula, and garlicky goodness. Smalls are 10 inch and would probably be the perfect portion for 1 person to finish. Since we also had an appetizer and shared pizzas, we only ate about half of each. I would be remissed if I didn't also mention the huge selection of beers on tap. Since I'm not a beer person, I got myself an Austin EastCiders Sangria which was pretty good.  SERVICE: Not sure how to feel about the service because there wasn't too much to it. I was a little confused because there seemed to be separate counters for food and drinks, but apparently both have to be ordered at the bar. The server brought the food out to us and when we asked for water, he said that there were cups inside - this would not have bothered me if I wasn't finding myself filling cups of water at the same drink station where the server was filling up my friend's root beer float...The server also brought us to-go boxes for our leftover pizza. Overall, the employees were friendly, but I also wondered if they needed that many for so little to do.  LOCATION: The front is already inviting with a beautifully lit outdoor seating area. The host greeted us in front of the restaurant and takes you to a seat - we sat in their other outdoor patio area which ran along the side of the restaurant and connects to the inside. Unlike some other patio dining, there is plenty of space and tables. Inside, the restaurant is nice and spacious with lots of seating, although they seemed to be sticking to the booth seating for COVID precautions. We came here on a Thursday night and it was fairly busy, but not crowded by any means.  PARKING: Plentiful since it's in a shopping area."

I added my name to the list and went to the bar to get some drinks. Within 20mins or so we were promptly seated outdoors. The outdoor area was pretty busy but nonetheless, food and drinks were served in a timely manner. I went for the small margherita pizza which was actually a lot for me but I ended up finishing the pie by the end of the night.   Overall pleasant experience - good food, good drinks at reasonable prices - I do recommend!"

I have ordered 2 versions of their breakfast sandwich S.O.B. And I have to say both are delish in their own way.  Vegan SOB made with beyond breakfast sausage and a house made cashew cheese. It's just stacked with flavor. Then their original SOB you can get a few different meat options I went with sausage - there some kind of aioli, avocado and taters! Such a mess but worth it!   They have craft beers you can take to go- I love that they carry the brand Untitled art. It's a traveling craft brewery that makes incredible flavors!   Dog friendly and just a must stop spot! GO!"

It was easy to find from my hotel and primely located across from target on 5th street. The signage only says \"brew and brew\" so I was confused but soon confirmed that I was at the correct place. I know I desired the bagel with smoked salmon so I ordered it but was not impressed. The bagel was cold, flavorless and the smoked salmon was flavorless. I love a good culinary concoction but this just kissed the mary. It was pretty yet did not taste amazing. Presentation was nice however and service was good."

He was being a dipshit about his mask (like acting like he was wearing it, but then intentionally wearing it wrong so the staff had to say something). He took a call and didn't wear it and that woman said something so he got all in a huff and walked out. It didn't seem like anyone threw him out, to me. I did kind of want to toss him myself but guys like that always have some virus. Don't want to get close.   Anyway I've been home to Texas a few times lately. A friend told me to try this place and I've gone every time I'm home. The food, beer (I don't like coffee) and staff have always been really good. Made me feel welcomed home. They do it right.

There were a good number of people hanging out, but plenty of available seating with large tables and ample outlets available. The noise level was perfect, not so quiet that you'd be uncomfortable having a private conversation, but quiet enough that you can get work done.   Coffee drink offerings were pretty standard in terms of options and prices. They have a really wide variety of beers available, as with most spots in the area most of them are localish. They could expand a little bit on their food options, especially on their non breakfast items since they seem to lean more towards the happy hour crowd.   I went for the cold brew which tasted great- super smooth and didn't need much milk to get a nice creamy taste. Be warned it is super strong, it takes a lot for me to get a caffeine rush from coffee and this really did the trick.   Overall I think it's a great place for a date spot, to get some work done, or hit a casual happy hour. I can definitely see myself coming back here in the future"

Surrounded by many new construction projects is a small coffee and brew joint nestled on the corner - you might pass it if you drive too fast - please don't!  I came in recently for breakfast and I was saddened a little as the menu had changed from my last visit. I'm normally chill about this however my wife was excited about the breakfast offerings I described only to realize they trimmed the menu down a bit.  I went 4 stars solely due to the reduced menu from the past. I just wish they did more breakfast on the weekend.  The coffee is great (FlatTrack) and beer even better I'd say. I find going over to FlatTrack gets me a little more for breakfast vs here although the venue is larger.  This isn't a diss but a request to improve is all. The mainstream is coming and I want my local to stay."

Brew + Brew was the clear winner!  They had an extensive menu, with lots of choices -- a very big factor for me.  My vanilla latte and my everything bagel were delicious.  The staff was warm and friendly.  Of course, there's no indoor service right now, but you can sit and eat outside on the patio.  And it's conveniently close to Target and Whole Foods."

The first incident I slightly lowered my mask so that I could use ApplePay, and the lady yelled at me to never do that again.  The second time, I sat down to have a 5 minute call with my boss, and Audrey yelled at me that I had to leave if I wasn't going to order anything. I was literally going to order something as soon as my call was over, but she kicked me out.   TERRIBLE customer service. As someone who comes in every day and lives right across the street, I will never be coming back."

Perfect sip for sitting outside and people watching  I didn't get any pictures of the espresso or store itself.   It is across the street from Target and Whole Foods. What an enjoyable experience! The staff was super helpful and willing to answer all my questions about their beans!"

Wright Bros BandB is in a great East Austin location. People are constantly filtering in and out, ordering coffee, cold pressed juices, and beer. I like seeing people drink beer at 11am on a Thursday morning. Makes me wonder what they do for a livin'.   The breakfast bagels are filling, and apparently the breakfast tacos sell out fast. My bagel had way too much dried rosemary on it, but that seems to be a popular bagel trend, so I guess I gotta deal with it or scrape it off (which I did)."

Lunch was solid service was good but I think that was partially because there were only 4 tables occupied when we were there but the service was attentive.  Menu is pretty large and has breakfast items during lunch so no complaints there because I do love me some breakfast for lunch or dinner.  Overall solid place would come back if I'm in the area not making a special trip here but if I'm here I definitely would come back."

The Sunday crew in the bar was super fun, our server Aaron was really kind   Their Sunday drink special is $3 mimosa and bloody Mary's.   Their gluten free bun is the best I've had at a restaurant, it is nice and chewy and stays together.   The chicken sandwich was great, a huge chicken breast with lots of bacon and avocado. They do a \"first timer\" complimentary dessert of their chocolate dump cake, my husband said it was great!"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place. Will come back for dinner to try more of the menu."

                "description": "The League is part neighborhood bar, part gastro-pub and I love both parts!    The bar and dinning areas are separated.  Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

As a former restaurant owner / operator, I appreciate the consistency and quality of the menu offerings. The facility is always clean and tables are cleared immediately when a party leaves. They have some really good deals, like burger Monday where you buy one and get one free. They also have a mouth watering prime rib special on Thursday that we can't wait to try.  One more attraction is , if you are into science or astronomy, you might be waited on by Galileo."

Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

Fish n chips are AOK there are better fish n chips in the area but you can easily split this bountiful dish.   The League pours a good cocktail and their bloodies, according to Plus 1, are right up there with the best. There are rotating taps for you beer snobs (like me).  There is a patio off to the side and a good-sized dining room. It does get crowded hence our late lunch HH visits.  Pro tip during football season Friday nights are packed pre-game."

Service was good and the place was small but cozy and clean.   We ordered the fish n chips and a burger with onion rings. The burger was fine, very average and a little bland. The fries that came with the fish were also ok but a little cold. The onion rings and the fish is the part I wanted to love but didn't. Taste wise they were good. However, they had so much batter on them it made me feel sick after just a few bites. I know these were heavy items to order for lunch, but the ratio of batter was just too much."

Though that is just the tip of the iceberg. Got here 2 hours before the fight and they would not turn any of the TVs to the prelims out on the patio. We asked 3 times and the 3rd time they said they could not cause people wanted to watch the soccer game that wasn't even on yet, also we are the only people at the time watching on the patio. Next is there was no cover when we got here, walked in sat down been drinking and eating and they are coming around telling us we have to go buy 15 dollar tickets at the door. On top of that the food is not high quality but the most expensive on the square and the service just isn't really there.   Also half the TVs are the fight and they are small TVs! Like super and low quality  Just ripping regular people off cause they are the only people on the square that show the fights. Bad business."

It was nice to reminisce.   Meet a couple for dinner while going through town. They recommended this place because they have \"The Incredible Burger\", a vegan burger option. They have driven to San Marcos a couple of times from Kyle just for that burger. One got it on a Patty Melt and said the Texas toast was the perfect addition. The other got it on a regular bun. Both with fries. Both disappeared quickly! They also had a Bloody Mary each. The staff was very accommodating in regards to one's request for extra olives.   My husband had the fish and chips Irish style, so a Guinness based batter. I had the fish and chips Texas style, so a corn meal based batter. Both were fantastic. I tried some of his. His better was crunchier and crisper than mine. Both were very good.  My husband had the Solid Gold lager. He said it was pretty light but good.   The overall noise got a little loud quickly but it's a Saturday night in a college town so that's not unexpected. There are a couple of pool tables and several TVs. It's a great college hang out place.   Lots of beer options.   My husband said there was a trough in the men's restroom... The ladies could have used some attention but mostly well maintained."

                "description": "I've been going to Sean patricks for a couple years now regularly with my girlfriend and my service dog. Every time we go someone always makes a comment to me about how well trained and well behaved my service dog is, and this evening was no different in regards to that. I always had a great experience with nice employees who were very welcoming.  I've never had a worse customer service experience in my life as I did today. The manager on duty Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall kicked me and my service dog out because he didn't have a vest for show that says service dog on it from Amazon. I explained to him more than I legally needed to in regards to my service dog. He at first turned me over to his manager under him, who was very nice, as employees usually are at Sean Patrick's. I compromised with sitting outside as they were busy on the inside anyways, and I didn't want to cause any issues. Then we were getting stormed on outside with winds blowing everything off our table and getting rained on while we ate. We only needed to have their coverings for the outside patio rolled down, but they took forever, and after asking multiple times for someone to come take care of it, I began taking care of it myself when finally Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall comes out and attempts to take care of it, but the covering just kept flying into our table and hitting my girlfriend. While we are getting pummeled by their outside seating covering. I pointed at it while making eye contact with Mr Wyatt, he makes eye contact, but continues being fixated on a tv while he leisurely walks over to assist. He walks back inside after putting a chair in the way. Well, the chair blows back on us with the crazy winds. We walk inside and get harassed by a bar back because Marshall Wyatt instructed him to in regards to my service dog. After explaining the law to the bar back we sit down, and I determined it was time to talk to someone about the experience I've had tonight. I spoke with the manager under mr Wyatt. Again, she was very nice, welcoming, and apologetic. After speaking with her mr Wyatt comes over to ask me how he was \"rude\" to me. I explained to him my experience, and he proceeded to argue every detail to defend and deny his lousy service. I thought he would come over to take responsibility as a manager and apologize, so I was caught off guard and told him that I didn't want to hear his argument, he then snatched everything off our table and kicked myself and my girlfriend out, saying that my service dog was in there \"illegally,\" even though I tried to explain to him that he can simply refer to the ADA website. I cannot say I will be coming back until Mr. Wyatt is gone.  Owner Brian Jeffrey, please make this right, and reach out to me. I will miss going to Sean Patrick's, but who my money goes to is a huge thing for me."

Me and my boyfriend came in to watch the World Cup game because I remembered this place had tons of tv's, and the most seating out of pretty much any bar in San Marcos . We ordered drinks , chili cheese fries, and a DELICIOUS 2$ scoop of pistachio almond ice cream in a waffle cone . All the food was awesome ( which I can't remember saying in past experiences .)   After the game we opted for some shuffle board and darts , which was a great end to an awesome World Cup game . Couldn't have asked for a better place/ environment for watching , enjoying great food, and hearing a lively crowd !!!"

It's ok to make it with beef but one must correct their menu as it's correctly called \"Cottage Pie\" when made with beef.   Blackjack Burger - Pretty Good Philly Cheese Steak - No Flavour (yes, there's a damn U in it) Smithwicks - Ran Out (pronounced incorrectly... don't say the W)  As a immigrant this is far from Irish, in fact so far removed from anything Irish it's an insult. No offense, but an American would never know the bloody difference! In addition, the bathrooms are named \"Lasses\" and \"Boyos\".... the ladies is a SCOTTISH name and the men's is WELSH name; no S at the end. This damn place needs to learn some shit really quickly, because they look like fuck'n idiots to everyone out of county.

The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

We stayed long enough to finish our beers and while we were drinking, staff propped the booth bench back together. I disassembled it twice but they kept putting it back.

Lots of good seating both inside and out for  those who want a more open environment. Their pub grub is excellent, Scotch eggs to die for and some really tasty cheese offerings as well as some standard fare. The whole staff is friendly, honestly, never had a grumpy server and I really like sitting on a couch...one of the seating options depending on where in the pub you are. Check this place out, you might find that you....DIG it too."

The beer selection now is better than it has ever been (coming from an Austin beer snob who used to live on Rainey). Don't pass this place by if it is on your radar!"

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

The adults got the Thor's Hammer and BLTA with fries and the table shared scotch eggs and pickle chips for apps. Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.  Pickle chips were average bar food. Overall, good meal and fair prices!"

                "description": "Been checking this place out online for months now and finally got an opportunity to go in person today. Wow. What a superior waste of time! It makes sense now why it was so empty when we went in.  You would think that as we're just coming out of a pandemic, pub and bar owners would be over the top happy to have people show up to eat and drink their food.  Well, not this owner! I'm still in shock how rude he was to me and in so little time of me being there! His bar waitress was super sweet and answering questions as it was our first time there. The plan was to order some grub, and craft beer and go sit outside on the picnic tables on this beautiful Sunday.  I was into my second question about one of the brunch items, when he rudely interjected himself into our conversation by trying to answer my question for the waitress where he clearly had not actually heard my question at all. I then corrected him by repeating what I actually asked. He then tried to defend his ignorance by stating something else about the food they serve that was a complete contradiction to half of the menu items. You should of heard the way this guy talked to me, there was absolutely no reason for it, completely unwarranted.  Plus he made himself look like a total idiot in front of everyone and it was so obvious. The more obvious thing was that he didn't want our business. When I say our, it was my husband, 2 yr. old and me. Maybe he felt threatened by our kid? He wasn't misbehaving or doing anything crazy. The nice waitress was chatting with him and everything was totally fine. And then out of no where the owner was just a total dick to me!! So of course we left, I mean who would stay!? But that's exactly what he wanted, for us to leave. With pleasure, Asshole!  I felt bad for the nice waitress, she seemed to be in shock also. Sure hope she finds somewhere else to work since I can bet she gets treated like garbage.  Funny thing is that I can't even comment on the food or beer which is all I was yes to try. This guy should do the world a favor, sell the place to someone who actually wants business and go take a class in The Important of People skills in the food and bev business. Mean people suck and they need to learn how to be nice or just grow the F up."

                "description": "First of all, not family friendly. Took my daughter here for a dinner with our dog ... sat outside, and ordered a couple of burgers, and after a long day I wanted a couple of cold, craft beers. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected a family friendly atmosphere, but I honestly didn't think I had to think it through too much. So, a group of men in their 30s-40s began arguing about a patron sneezing , dropping \"f bombs\". The patron went in to get the owner. I thought \"ok cool, the owner will take care of this.\" Instead, of calming the situation, he comes out dropping \"f bombs\" of his own, bragging about how he's going to kick all their asses, and how big of a Texan he is. I asked if he could watch his language in front of my family, he ignored me. So, I took it as a way to teach my daughter that this is the definition of a bunch of men that are nothing but losers. I told her, this is not the way men that have any class should act in public. There were also plenty of other women around that didn't need to hear all of this male drama while they are trying to have an enjoyable evening with their families. The guy that actually started the whole thing apologized. Owner, Eric, you should be ashamed of yourself. Dude, have some awareness ... no one cares about how cool and tough you think you are while they are trying to have dinner and spend some time with their friends and family. The people next to me just got up and left, too. You were so caught up in your own ego, you didn't even notice. I spent $42 and still left your staff a 20% tip, mostly cuz I felt sorry they have to work for such a loser. Not sure what Texas you claim to have grown up in, but not the one my family has lived in for 6+ generations. We all make mistakes .. and I rarely leave reviews or waste any of my precious time on this kinda thing .. but this needed to be said."

Got a flight of 5 beers including the tropical haze, cider, PBB Stout, BBA Stout (11% but still very smooth and wouldn't be able to tell it's that high with how easy it is).  Enjoyed all the beers but went back for 2nds with the BBA Stout, comes in a 7oz pour due to the higher abv.  They serve a variety of diff sandwiches, we tried their Hartie Artie, basically a crispy sandwich with artichoke and tomatoes in it, real crunchy and satisfying!

I've been here pre-pandemic and during, and I gotta say...I'm so glad they're here to grace the South Austin beer community with their presence. When I visited the first time they had just opened and their taproom was still a work in progress. They still had a good selection of board games, self-serve water and beer/cider in a dog-friendly taproom. Yes, I repeat...bring yo dawgs.  Most recently, I ordered a trio of their 32 oz crowlers. There was a deal going on, and I GOTTA SAY THE SEVEN STILLS OMG. That scotch ale was deliciously dark and creamy without being overboard. I was afraid it would be burning on the throat and too infused with that liquor aftertaste. BUT it was so deliciously decadent. It had a dark chocolate feel with a full and steady mouth feel! Deeeeelish. I hope they brew it again. Their Peak Season IPA was also SO yummy and refreshing. I just checked out their tap list and there are so many creative and interesting beers right now. SO GET ON IT Y'ALL.  Pro Tip: check out their instagram page because there are usually cool deals or posts (like one time they gave free warm pretzels to the first few customers)!"

Great people with great beer and unsuspecting great food.    Peak season is a top tier hazy IPA.  Radberry was a great sour that was sweet without being fruit juice.  I think it'd satisfy both the tart lovers and Kettle sour seekers.  I was saving my appetite for a BBQ heavyweight but after tasting my girlfriend's turkey pesto I totally regret my decision to not get food.  The whole thing was a delight.  The flavors and texture all come together to deliver one heck of a Sammy.   Definitely a destination to stop at!"

The staff was really friendly and helpful. We're will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Came here to hang out with a large group on a Saturday afternoon, they have a sizable space with plenty of tables, space to stand, and games to play while you're there. There was a lively bunch of people throughout our time there, but it never got too crowded.   Their beer selection was fairly limited, but it's understandable given they're quite new to the area. The bartender was super helpful and let my friend and I sample a few of them. Being indecisive I still chose to have a flight after.   My personal favorite beer I tried was the dry hopped wheat, but the hazy IPA and the raspberry milkshake IPA also stood out! Their menu was quite IPA heavy, so hopefully they'll continue to branch out, but it does look like they rotate their menu quite often.   There's also a fantastic Korean food truck out back that I highly recommend checking out while you're here.   Overall, I think the combination of good space to hang out, tasty beer, and delicious food is well worth checking out."

                "description": "This place is fine.   The whole seating situation is confusing. You're supposed to get assigned a table at the bar, but the sign is hard to see and if the line is long it seems like groups tend to seat themselves and send a person to the line. Then, the food menus are only at the bar or at a table with a QR code, so it's confusing how you're supposed to look to decide what you want, and you have to decide on the spot at the bar. After all that, our table was actually taken and we had to be reassigned, which isnt a big deal but the whole thing seems unnecessary.   Regarding food and drink, our pretzel was good but my Cobb salad was pretty bland. It was a solid burger with a good pickle but the potato wedges or whatever they are supposed to be are mushy and not like fries or chip. They were sold out of brats.   My beer was tasty, I got the Confabulator, but my partners beer was terrible. He got the \"Mark It 8, Dude,\" which is described as \"toasty, smokey and not out of line.\" It tastes only of artificial smoke and caramel. I drinkable in my opinion. Probably won't be back."

                "description": "TLDR: nothing particularly bad about it, but doesn't really stand out from the noise.   First off we will start with the beer. I had a flight, which come with 5 beers. I had the Dr. Doctor, the Skee-Ball champ, Electric Lederhosen, the Hopheaded strangler, and the barrel aged shadow tower. They were all pretty good. And in most markets it would have been a good lineup, but in Austin, it was nothing more than average, and they didn't really have anything that helped differentiate them from the competition.   The food falls victim of much the same problem. I had the Beer-Belly burger with German Potato Mashers. It was good. Nothing really to complain about it, but there was nothing that made it pop. It was a hearty heavy dish and delivered what it promised too.   The service was fantastic. Everyone was nice and polite, and I really had no issues with it whatsoever.   The atmosphere was so-so. The place was clean, well spaced and decorated, but the inside is essentially a large hall with a bunch of individual tables which gave the place something like a cafeteria vibe, which is the exact opposite I want in a beer garden."

Cool Spanish music playing and really interesting bar with knowledgeable staff on alcohol. We had a burger with pork belly on it that was delicious...pork belly could have been a little crispier and burger a little less cooked, but that's just a personal preference. Flavor was spot on! Hummus was fantastic, and curried tomato bisque was AMAZING. Salad was okay too, but I don't think that's their selling point. Overall, great Austin eatery."

Food and drinks are ordered at the bar.   The menu is German inspired with items such as delicious and fluffy pretzels to flammkuchen (flatbread). The vegetarian flammkuchen is really tasty with the cashew pesto. I usually order the Stay Golden beet salad, which has quinoa and yummy toppings. I pay a little extra for chicken on top.  The beers are consistently good and the tap list is a good mix of styles. Chris, the owner/brewer (also former homebrewer), has always been great at German beers and he continues to do so on a larger scale.   If you're a non-beer drinker, there are wines and ciders available as well."

Just to be clear, I'm not into drinking, so I can't say what the quality or character of the alcoholic drinks are like with confidence.  The atmosphere is consistently warm and welcoming, with cool, helpful staff and actually great food. The mac and cheese is amazing (which is notable because I normally don't go for that dish), and the pizza, specifically the Pearsciutto, is scrumptious. The wait times can get a little hefty if you come during peak meal hours, and food tends to run out on Friday evenings, but otherwise, it's a great spot to chill at with friends in the area. Expect to see leashed dogs and tired but happy boulderers enjoying a cold glass of beer and hot food with their friends after a solid session. Overall, one of my favorite places to be after bouldering."

I feel like the lime wedge could've been more substantial, but that's pert near splitting hairs.   Buttery, chewy inside, baked to a golden brown and kissed with salt, the pretzel would please even the most cantankerous German tastebuds.   The currywurst consists of sliced bratwurst slathered with tangy housemade curry ketchup served over German potato mashers. It seemed ambitious and I was skeptical, but it turned out to be great.  And of course the patio is dog friendly."

                "description": "Having lived in the neighborhood for almost two years now Brewtorium has become my go to spot to hang out and grab a beer. It's a pretty popular spot but the space is so big I've never really had difficulty finding a comfortable spot, both during and before covid.   Their staple beers aren't my type, the Kolsch and Vienna lager seem to be their biggest hits, but they do a great job of mixing things up on their rotating beers. They consistently nail it with their IPAs and stouts, and I love how creative they get with their other offerings, but resist the urge to have them get comically ridiculous like some breweries in town. If you're looking to try something a little different that won't be a total shock to your palate I'd highly recommend the Schwarzbier. While the dark color might scare some off it's pretty light with a nice coffee taste in the background. If you blindfolded me I certainly would have guessed it was a much lighter looking beer.  The staff is super friendly and on has been on top of cleanliness and distancing protocols. When larger social events and meetups were a thing this was a great spot for them. They have a big collection of board games inside that I'm hoping will make a return some time in the near future.  The one area I will say I'm not a big fan of is the food. Most friends of mine will say go for the pizza, but the spoiled New Yorker in me sees them as an okay vessel for toppings.   Overall I couldn't be happier to live in such close proximity to a great spot like this. Highly recommend giving them a try!"

The cashier told me the ticket was lost because their outdoor system didn't connect, so I would have to re-order the food. She apologized and said she'd comp some items to make amends for the error. I didn't end up having anything comped on my tab, which was fine by me, but then I saw a charge come through for my original order as well.   I tried calling 5 times over the course of 3 days before finally getting in touch with someone. After explaining the situation, he told me to just dispute the charge with my credit card company and that there's nothing they can do.   Truly abysmal customer service."

                "description": "Read a bunch of restaurant reviews on Yelp before deciding on this place. There are so many great eats in Austin and this one is definitely worth writing about.   I went in on a Sunday evening around 8:45pm. There was hardly anyone inside so I decided to eat at the bar. The bartender (Laura Lee!) helped me dwindle down my options. I had read about the tomato and nectarine salad, but was worried that it would have a mustard flavor in it. She assured me that there wasn't and admitted that she, too, wasn't a mustard fan. SO glad I ordered it! It was such a perfect balance of flavors and I finished the entire thing.   Next up - should I get the eggplant parm or the \"crab\" cakes. She thought about it and says \"go with the crab cakes.\" Holy moly!!  These were INCREDIBLE! So flavorful and the sauce that came with it - just perfection! Highly recommend!!  Check this place out if you want something a little away from 6th street. It's just a few minutes away and so, so worth it. :)"

                "description": "Third visit to this upscale plant-based restaurant and were not let down. Recommend making a reservation especially if you want indoor seating. We enjoy the dimmed ambience, but sometimes large parties do make it loud inside. Our favorite starter: the Buffalo cauliflower with blue cheese. Favorite entree: the spicy \"chicken\" sandwich with oyster mushroom (nice that it isn't cauliflower). Not a huge fan of their Mac and cheese or loaded fries. On our most recent trip, we tried The 'burger' which was delicious especially if you like arugula. They serve upscale cocktails, beer, and wine. Pricing is pretty fair: $6-$12 for a drink and $13-$20 for an entree. Huge bonus: parking has never been an issue!!!"

The cocktails were also great. A lot of people mention its pricy, but we really didn't think so compared to other restaurants in austin and for the portion size. We'll be back soon!"

We ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the hill country chicken and gravy. There was a lot of breading on both \"chicken\" dishes which was a bit much but the flavor was pretty good overall. The mac n cheese was a little bland, but that was the first vegan Mac n cheese I've had. We ordered the loaded fries as an app. Those were my favorite of everything we ordered. This is a pretty loud restaurant, but isn't always a bad thing if you get seated next to the right guests! Overall, I recommend at least trying this place out! There's an extensive drink menu, so it would probably be good for happy hour!"

The brussels sprouts were SO good. I was very surprised because I usually do not find brussels sprouts particularly appetizing. I had the Hill Country \"chicken\" and gravy. The fake chicken was really good, and it definitely didn't taste like chicken but like something close enough. The potatoes and gravy tasted weird. The Beer Plant curry had a strange taste. They had a lot of beers on tap, and we sampled around 10. The ciders were decent. I did not enjoy the \"when doves cry\" cocktail because it was bitter, but everyone else liked it. The atmosphere inside was really nice."

I wish there was more glaze on it though and that it packed more spice. It's pretty mild but the sprouts were still quite tasty. The Carolina was a very interesting sandwich. I was expecting them to use jackfruit in a pulled pork sandwich but they used banana blossom instead. The flavor was there especially with the bbq sauce but the texture was definitely weird.  My favorite from this place is the kimchi grilled cheese! Being no dairy I have not had a grilled cheese in AGES and it was definitely something I really craved. This grilled cheese hit the spot. I love that they added kimchi and pear to give it more depth. The kimchi was pretty overpowering though. But overall the sandwich was so delicious.  Great food, slightly pricey."

Not quite outdoor but it did provide fresh, moving, outside air which made me feel more comfortable eating there. I can see this seating as advantageous during rainy weather  where you could eat \"outside\" and remain dry.   The food: looking at the other plates, I want to go back to taste what I saw. I ordered the chicken plate. Everything on the plate was well seasoned.  What I would suggest is if you like gravy ask for extra. I didn't have enough for both the potatoes and the chicken.  The chicken was super crispy, you definitely need the heavy duty knife that comes with it. It was great!  Would return for a meal to try other options."

                "description": "My best friend whose vegan was raving about this place since I landed in Austin and I knew I had to give this place a shot! We came by a few days before and unfortunately this place was packed so I decided to swing by before heading back to Cali. We ended up going for brunch and luckily I was able to call and snag a last reservation. Not gonna lie I was pumped! Once we got there we were promptly seated and ended up ordering:  *Fried chicken and waffles: I loved the chicken here because it was super crispy and it had like hot chicken seasoning which was BOMB! I literally kept eating it off my friends plate. The waffles in my opinion were too crispy and not sure how to describe but they were really bland. Like I have had waffles before and I understand they are light on flavor but this literally had no flavor whatsoever. Had to eat it with chicken to taste something  *oyster and grits: me and my friend were sooooooooo excited to order this not gonna lie but this was  the most disappointing. This was grits with chili oil and grilled mushrooms with seasoning. The grits was one of the most bland things I have ever tasted and not gonna lie I couldn't eat much. Usually I still scarf food down but this just tasted like nothing. Chili oil made it too oily. My friend tried mixing it up to eat it but still flavor was lackluster. I would not order this again.  *Kolache: this was a pastry like thing with impossible meat inside and again did not LOVE. The meat inside was lukewarm - cold. I liked it overall but needed more stuffing and more warmth since its a pastry!!  Overall, the food was okay. I don't know if I would try again unless I came for dinner. Service was great though and really enjoyed the help!"

I got the \"chicken\" platter which came with green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, and 2 pieces of fried \"chicken\".  My goodness the flavors were amazing! The green beans had good seasoning and were uniformly cooked, each being a bit crispy. The mashed potatoes and gravy were savory and had a really good flavor profile. The fried \"chicken\" was a little dry and the texture was slightly different than what I've had at other places but it all worked together. Whatever seasoning they used in / in the \"chicken\" was phenomenal! Each bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth it was soo good.   The less great aspects of thia place are the food took a really long time to come out from when we ordered. I think it was like 40 minutes, maybe an hour? They also have a system where you put a card on the table to indicate you'd like a waiter to come over and it took 25 minutes for someone to stop by even though there were multiple staff that passed us before that point.   My friend I was eating with also didn't enjoy their gyro as much as I enjoyed the \"chicken\" platter. She said it was cold and ok but not super great but she liked the fries and cheesecake.  I would definitely order from here again but maybe do takeout instead of dine in."

I asked if I could just pay for something so I can use the restroom. I was told the cheapest thing was an $18 shirt. Upon checking the menu online, I can see that that was a lie. I would have gladly paid for $12 nachos to eat but nope..the cheapest thing was the shirt. Gotta keep people from not using the bathroom.  I can understand the policy. But lying and turning away a transaction to hold a principle? It deserves a Yelp review."

                "description": "I would really like to give Abel's their 5 stars which they probably deserve but the Restaurant sits at the bottom of a hill. This is not ok when you're bringing in a bus loaded with passengers. Shell passengers at that (Shell has a zero tolerance for unsafe practices). Cars on every side of the street so a bus would have to unload in the street. Luckily for me this time Heaven was on our side by allowing us to get our buses up from the hill. Going down the driveway was just as challenge because we had to turn just right to make the turn to drop the passengers off at the door.  The OS came when we had to turn the buses just right to get out the drive and up the hill onto the street. What makes this even more dangerous are the pedestrians walking in front of the bus, to the side of the bus and in the back of the bus.  It takes a skilled driver (like myself) to be able to get out of the mess I was in. This was the perfect time of all the times I should told my clients dropping them at the door was unsafe. But there I went.  If I didn't position the bus just right getting up that hill a tow truck would have to be called to unstick me. That's what we call bottoming out the bus, when the axil is stuck on concrete enabling the bus to move.  Now my coworker trusted me and followed me right down that forsaken hill and tried to get up the hill as I did.  Now mind you, if we get the buses stuck it will take a tow truck at least 2 hrs to be dispatched and out to our location. It's cost $$$ for a bus pull out, the restaurant is located in a neighborhood so they would have to use an alternate to their homes, patrons inconvenienced, our passengers stomachs full they ready to go to get to their hotel. Shell most definitely will report us for an unsafe practice and we would have to answer for that unsafe practice....just a mess. Anyways, I got my bus out and the other bus as well. There was no bus parking not enough curb parking so we were unable to dine at the restaurant. I forgot about that so I change my rating to 1 star. J/k"

                "description": "Absolutely amazing Experience! Great Food, Great Views and Rob my waiter has been fantastic the couple of times I've come so far!  I have to say that I almost didn't go because of the reviews here, but my experience was totally different. And it was absolutely a 5 star experience.  Overall the Views are objectively great right off the water, the food has been very good both times - I had a really good Salmon dish most recently. But more importantly the waiter Rob has been incredibly kind and attentive - even offering Iced Tea \"to go\" both times.  I'd recommend you judge Abels for yourself and come to the restaurant -- I actually asked them about previous reviews and they did say they've been really shifting all of their service to be the best and that's what I've seen first hand.  I can't speak to how they were in the past, but today the experience is 5 stars!"

                "description": "I would give this 20 if I could. Visiting from San Diego, we found Abel's on an idyllic Sunday afternoon.  Although there was a wait for a table, Johnny, the BEST bartender/server EVER, found a couple of barstools and made room for us at the bar.  Johnny makes a GREAT host, and GREAT Bloody Mary!  World class. Perfect blend of spices with other ingredients.  I had the Texas burger (YUM) and my husband had Abel's Tex-Mex twist on a Philly steak sandwich. \"Absolutely delicious!\" The open air bar on the lake is a beautiful setting, the weather was perfect, multiple football games on big screens, and a great vibe.   Fabulous food, and not at all expensive.  But Johnny made our experience superb."

I used to come here frequently when I was new to Austin but I think my standards were lower and theirs were higher. First of all, it's a pain to get parking around here. Once you're parked, you're better off going to one of the neighboring establishments. The food is so mediocre and overpriced, and I've nearly tried it all. It's not bad, but I'd say it's on par with many chain \"bar and grill\" type of restaurants. The view of the lake is the only asset that draws crowds."

It was embarrassing for me because I picked the place. Thank God that my friends and I are pretty chill people, so we just rolled with it.  However the service was abysmal, the Mexican Martini was not drinkable, bathrooms were filthy and there was not a manager in sight the whole night. Well, at least not until we left and saw them all chatting on an unoccupied patio to the side of the restaurant. I guess it was socialization time while their servers are outside floundering. The girl who served us was seemingly taking care of the whole patio (although failing) and said it was her first week. Wild.   Two people from my party didn't get their meals until everyone else finished. We had to basically beg for our drinks. And the food was honestly 2 stars at best...  Only good thing about this place was the ambiance"

Abel's will be in my routine rotation from here on for dinner and drinks.   They have always had a strong kitchen for an affordable bar and grill - so much better than the place next door. Tonight, I was taken care of very well by two affable gents at the back bar, Stuart and Eric. Stuart told me I should try the blackened redfish. He shared it was a new rotating special. I was amazed how perfectly it was seasoned and cooked.  One of the best redfish dishes I have had in months. I immediately asked what I need to do to convince them to serve this on the regular menu. They said let our management know online so here it is.  I was texting friends about how good it was and that we need to come back soon. Please keep this dish on the menu - as often as possible - and give your chef a raise.    Another fun plus - Stuart and Eric know their sports. We had a fun smart conversation about all current sporting events.   Bottom line.  If you are a sports fan, go here. eat the redfish, ask for Stuart and Eric. drink, have fun and repeat. Also, brunch on Sundays for early fantasy games is another great call.   Five stars on this visit. See you soon."

Both out of her control. She got them both taken off rightfully so.  The BIG ISSUE was ours and two different tables cards were wrong up wrong, mixed up, and delivered to wrong tables. Our credit card went to someone else's table and we found it ourselves. Still not mad at that sweet girl at all for the record. Our tab came out cheaper and we signed it and got out. Forgive us of our sins. What was EXTREMELY CONCERNING is the manager approached my father IN THE BATHROOM and chased him out the front door. My father explained that a transaction was made and there was a signed document, end of story. Argue that with anyone especially when we were on the street walking to our car. What does the manager do? He THREATENED to call the cops! My husband, who paid the tab suggested to the manager that we go inside and talk privately. The manager proceeded to discuss this private matter  in front of customers IN THE PARKING LOT! Legally, we did nothing wrong. Transaction was made between the establishment and our family. Signed document. Off the property. Boom. If he would have came up to us and started with excuse me, we messed up, can we fix this please- would have been the start to a better approach. Chasing my father. Threatening to call the cops. Discussing in front of customers after we left. We could have sorted it out had he not been so aggressive. I was in the service industry for 8 years, he was 1000% out of line. The scenery is pretty nice though. One star fir that."

The establishment is adorable - informal seating inside and out.   I first got some pappadum and a few chutneys-tamarind and mint. They were spicy! Caught me off guard but delicious for sure.    My mom ordered the Curry Trio with chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, and saag paneer. I ordered  a beef kabob curry taco. Every bite of every dish was delicious. While I loved my taco, I highly recommend the Curry Trio because you get a great choice.   When we first got there, I was like meh. Only a few tables were seated outside and the inside was empty. But right after we ordered, the place quickly filled up! Wow.   The service was superb. I couldn't have asked for a better server. I'll definitely be back!"

I got the vegetable samosas, and the samosas were nearly perfect, with the potato and pea filling having just the right level of seasoning. They came with beautiful mango chutney whose chunks were visible and a lovely green chutney. Both were so delicious I was hard put to decide which I wanted to put on each of the three samosas.  For drinks I had two of the Wasatch Polygamy (a nitro porter), and it was fantastic. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't as overwhelming as a milk stout, but also the delicious flavor of a porter.  The patio dining was great, with plenty of shade.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was... slow, with respect to both drinks and food. Otherwise, the whole thing was outstanding."

We sat inside it's smaller but very cozy. They have a bar with many draft beers, wine and specialty drinks.  We started with the vegetable samosas and it came with side of mint sauce and mango chutney that was so tasty. Both complimented the samosas in a wonderful way. The flavors were amazing.  I ordered the tiki masala taco that was filled with so much flavor and very filling.       A must try!! And hubby had the trio which he choose tiki masala, curry chicken and butter chicken along with coconut rice. All three were fantastic.  Service was good and food was fantastic and very reasonably priced.  I'm excited to come back and try something new on the menu and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Street!! #supportsmallbusiness"

Went to lunch with coworkers on the first day of fall, so we got a table outdoors, never stepped foot inside. Service was slow, but it seemed it was only one waiter, so no points taken away for that.  Server was detailed in explaining what everything was and the level of spice and comfort. We had one vegan and one spice sensitive guest in our group, so he pointed out what would be best for the group to order. I ordered chicken nachos, and paneer tacos, wanting spice and meat. Other guests ordered samosas with mango chutney, vegan nachos, and spinach paneer. It was filling enough with a beautiful presentation! The jalapeno cream mixed with tamarind on the tacos mixed perfectly with the Indian spices.  The curry on the shredded chicken and tortilla chips (couldn't tell if they were made in house or store bought) had me trying not to lock the bowl. Will definitely go back to try more items on the menu!"

But seriously, if you're not already in San Marcos, come here. And eat this. It's that good. If you think you're a foodie and haven't tried this, fix that. So incredibly good. And for $9 per taco that's basically a meal and a party in your mouth, it doesn't exactly set you back much. They have a great beer selection too and cool ambiance and attentive service. But the tacos are the draw. Come here. Eat the Indian style tacos. 5 stars."

                "description": "Unique spot with a mix of great options of drafts and curries!  We enjoy having different types of beers and this place has a good unique assortment of drafts to try.  I was able to get some lavender cider since it was pretty early in the day, but the porter and stout options were very tempting (some at over 12% alcohol).  The dogs were with us so we settled outside in their spacious yard that has a lot of shade and a fan blowing.  We ordered curry fries as an appetizer and they were wedged exactly like chic fil a fries seasoned in a curry mix powder.  These were good, but can do with a pinch of sugar and lots of extra spice.  I had the chicken Tikka masala plate and my husband got the chicken 65 taco.  The taco looked more like a wrap and wasn't as filling as what he expected, but tasted pretty good.  Fried chicken seasoned in sauce inside the taco had a good kick to it.  My chicken Tikka masala plate was delicious, but a little extra spice would help.  Also, I think the restaurant can do better by adding naan! Great concept to check out!"

Their garlic pizza is one of my favorites, but the cheese burger and south Austin are also solid choice.   We always have to get their mozzarella bread because the cheese/garlic/butter/crust combination makes it one of the best things on the menu.   They have a huge rotating beer selection and plenty of seating if you're wanting to eat there. I've taken pizza to go a few times too and it transports well."

                "description": "Aviator Pizza was solid, not amazing, but okay. We grabbed togo and picked it up on our way home from the gym so we could just collapse and eat some pizza. We got one white pie with arugula on top. It tasted like the greens weren't washed, and they were all wilted and slimy by the time the pizza got home 10 minutes later.   The other pizza was better with a variety of meats and veg on top. But overall the dough felt a little undercooked on both and generally was a bit chewy.   I'd be willing to try this spot again and likely sit down to eat it in person and hope that it's better right out of the oven, maybe it just doesn't travel well? But pizza is a notoriously delivered food item, so I would hope that's not the case.   All in all, i'm not that impressed but willing to give them another go."

I think this means I should write about pimps and gangsters in purple Cadillacs.   No ... there were no purple Cadillacs here. Sorry! And I was the only one there. But I got me a pizza and a salad (no beer). Then went next door and dropped $300 in a cash game at Shuffle 512 because a Facebook friend/fan sat right next to me and we were having fun and gambling.   If I had gone in to Shuffle 512 first, I might have won. Therefore, theoretically, this was a $300 pizza and salad. I'd leave a woah emoji, but not sure if it will show up on Yelp. I mean, the emoji comes up but I have tried it before and it was just a weird space. And I don't want you to associate me with pimps, gangsters, and weird spaces (purple Cadillac okay).   As far as the pizza goes, traditional bar pizza. Good not great. Salad pretty solid. Atmosphere very good but I was there early so not 100% sure.   Overall, recommended as a feeler to see if it's for you."

The staff were nice however we asked for her to change the TV to the TX/OU game but she kept forgetting.  We asked her again and finally tried to locate it however the cable they had didn't allow the game so we had to watch it on our phone.  We wished they offered nicer plates and flatware; they gave us paper plates and plastic forks but we aren't fancy people so it was all good.  The place was super clean and relaxing.

First off the pizza is great and love the beer selection BUT after ordering I used the restroom and there was a crew member that used the restroom at the same time and didn't wash their hands.

It seems whoever answered back did a half ass apology by saying maybe they were washing their hands in a different sink or were intending to wear gloves.

Unfortunately, it came out late and exactly with our pizza ($25 for a '18 pie with pepperoni, mushrooms, and roasted garlic toppings).  The beers were great, and they had plenty of local selections to choose from. I would not get the caprese salad again because it's overpriced for the small portion size. The large pizza was great size, and with the salad, we had half to take home. While the ingredients and toppings were fresh, they didn't bake the pizza to order (disappointed because we asked for well done, but it still came out a bit doughy).  Overall, it's a bit of a premium price point, but likely worth a shot at a few other menu options.   Last note- the patio area is perfect for sitting outside on a nice afternoon/evening, so hope to bring a few more friends next time."

                "description": "We love this place! The staff is extremely accommodating and helpful. One lady (I'm sorry I don't remember her name) tried three different propane heaters before giving up and calling out her manager Angel, who switched tanks and expertly wrangled the fickle device to make sure we were nice and toasty.  The food is excellent. I particularly like the cinnamon dessert. Best. Crust. Ever. The constantly rotating selection of alcoholic beverages is perfectly splendid. I would recommend some great beers but you likely will not make it in time; you can never tire of the same old selection! (I recommend the Pineapple IPA and the Cherry Sour). I highly recommend gracing this fine establishment during these trying times, and enjoying a great atmosphere with wonderful people and excellent food and drink. Bonus: all this while staying safe with their proactive pandemic protocols."

                "description": "I can't tell you how many times I've thought about this place after eating here last weekend. They have a great selection of craft and local beers. (They even had the amazing electric jellyfish hazy ipa- one of my al time favorites). We ordered the basil and goat cheese breadsticks that came with ranch and marinara, and went straight to the pecan cinnamon breadsticks. The dough here is amazing... it's light but manages to have that slightly chewy texture. It's seriously SO GOOD. And the toppings/garnishes are great quality. You know the food is amazing when I forget to take a single picture because I'm too busy stuffing my face. Definitely can't wait to come back."

                "description": "Our first time here.  We were looking for a new place for Happy Hour and I remembered reading some great things about Aviator Pizza from some fellow Yelpers.  They were spot-on!    Beer selection:  Awesome!  Huge selection.  They even had a sour, Red Bud Ale, and it was the perfect degree of tartness with enough smoothness to accompany a pizza.  Happy hour is until 6:00 pm and is $1 off all beers.  Sadly, nothing off pizzas.  Pizzas: Where do I start?? Long list of specialty pizzas and so hard to make a choice!  We decided on two small (9\") pizzas to share. We selected the Pepperoni and Basil and The Lazy Goat.  We loved them equally and would order both again.  Crust was a perfect thin texture.  Staff:  Super friendly and quick service.   Decor/ambience: Typical brew pub.  Lots of long tables and benches and an outdoor patio area to bring the dogs to. ( Apparently the outdoor area is also where all the parents with babies and toddlers gravitate to)  Suggestion for management: Erect a small privacy panel between parking lot and patio, OR move the \"pick up only\" parking spots to the right, away from the patio.  People pull into the parking spots and leave their bright headlights on while one person goes in to pick up order.  It is blinding for people sitting on the patio. This happened repeatedly.  *Spots in front of eyes*"

When calling the pizza place they couldn't refund us do to purchasing though the app. The repeatedly apologized and the manager brought us our beer herself and gave us an extra one!

                "description": "Hahne Estates Winery Tasting Room is located in downtown Johnson City next to the Pecan Street Brewery.  The tasting room has been open for about four months, but owner and winemaker, Gary Hahne, has been making wine for a lifetime.  Gary is a Texas Hill Country Native and his family roots date back to his great grandparents who immigrated to the Stonewall area from Germany.  His parents were close friends to LBJ and Lady Bird. The Hahne surname in German translates to the English word rooster, which ties to the colorful rooster found on the winery's logo.  There is no tasting fee to sample the four dry wines, and one sweet Sangria style wine on the tasting menu.  Each bottle of wine tells a different story of the Hahne family and the surrounding hill country.  As you sip and savor the flavor of the well balanced, delicious, palatable wines. You can walk around the winery and enjoy the historic pictures of the Hahne family, and hear about the family and area history.  I had the great pleasure of being able to talk with Gary himself about his amazing family heritage.  I enjoyed all of the five wines.  My favorite was a bold; well balanced, red blend (Tempranillo, Cab Sauv, and Nero D'Avola) entitled Texas Tapestry.  I also loved the Texas styled Chianti appropriately named Texanti.  This was a softer red, fruit forward, but well balanced with lingering notes.  I also very much enjoyed the dry rose that is named after Gary's grandfather, Opa.  The Viognier blend was also surprisingly good, with interesting peach like notes.   My visit here was delightful, and I hope to return soon.  Gary is passionate about making quality wine to enjoy with us, and to pass down his story to be remembered for years to come."

Mr. Hahne seemed a little rough around the edges until he started spilling out all the beautiful memories him and his family made through the years. We talked about cars, churches, presidents and of course, wine. I couldn't have been anymore impressed with the knowledge he has acquired. Mr. Hahne's winery was clean, filled with old music and had the perfect ambience of the Hill Country. Thank you so much for making my first experience one to remember!"

He welcomes you like family and we listened to all of his great stories. We wanted up staying for two hours and enjoying a bottle of the Texanti, it was difficult to decide which one we enjoyed the best. The wine tastings are at no charge and all five are the best we tasted in the area. We have never gone to a winery and enjoyed every tasting we had, but here we did. We would not only go back but, this would be the sole reason we would visit the area again. Thank you Gary for the wonderful wine and visit. We will definitely see be back soon."

                "description": "If you've never met owner Gary Hahne before, then you're in for a real treat. Besides his wine making history, he always has great stories to tell about the Hill Country and LBJ Ranch.  His family has good history to one of the states famous politicians, Lyndon B. Johnson.  Gary has many tall and true tales that makes a good story telling experience while sipping his wines. You can also view much of his family's history with the Johnsons as can be seen with some unique photographs that are displayed on the wall.  Besides the family history, he has a good selection of wine to try out.  Right now, he's getting his grapes from just about anywhere he can.  In Stonewall, he is planning on planting a vineyard starting with an acre of Nero d'Avola.  This is one of the hot and dry Italian varietals that has a potential to do well in the Hill County's climate.  There are currently five wines available in his new tasting room that opened up back in July.  For the whites, you'll start off with the Blanco.  It's a Viognier blend with nice intense favors.  The Blanco River artwork on the label is quite spectacular.  The Opa is a dry Rose` that is a blend of Riesling, Thurgaw, and Spatburgunder (aka Pinot Noir).  A very nice chilled Rose` to have for those extended summer fall months in Texas.  The label depiction is a pencil drawing version of Gary's grandfather on a horse.  The actually picture is on the wall.  Yes, his \"Opa\" actually did what you see on the label and, of course, there's a good story Gary will tell you about that one as well.  The Texanti is Gary's take on Chianti style wines - good fruit flavors for this Sangiovese blend.  Gary's take on a Bordeaux style wine is called Texas Tapestry.  It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, and Nero d'Avola.  It's quite bold, has good tannins, and well balanced.  The addition of Nero d'Avola is his unique take on this classic red blend.  He might be on to something here.  The last wine is Armadillo WH.  The WH stands for World Headquarters.  It's a sweet Cab, but with only 1% residual sugar - quite nice to have in the afternoon.  It's a real treat to have a true local making wine in the Texas Hill Country.  The great and interesting stories Gary tells just adds to that unique experience that you won't find elsewhere.  Stop by his shop along Johnson City's square on your next wine trek thru these parts. You'll have a pleasant time here sipping and chatting with Gary. Enjoy!"

I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

                "description": "This place has RATS. It's a shame because I love eating here, but after seeing a rat scurry across the dining room floor I will NOT be coming back. This isn't even the first time this has happened. On another occasion, I saw a rat running out from the KITCHEN and into the parking lot. It was disgusting. The owners of this business need to have pest control come in so that their patrons can eat without worrying about rats, and so their kitchen staff doesn't have to cook with pests. I've worked in the service industry and know this is no ones fault but the owners. Do better by your employees and your customers and get rid of the rats."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

                "description": "The outside patio is nice and has a good vibe.  Unfortunately, Jollyville is busy so you have to speak loudly to each other but there's not a lot Pour House can do about that.  At first, our waiter seemed like he was going to be a lot of fun but we quickly realized he was all show and no action. He forgot to bring one of our drinks the first time around and then we very rarely saw him after that until he was ready for us to pay the bill. We had to find a different waiter to order a second round of margaritas.  The margaritas themselves we're nothing to get excited about and seemed like they had very little alcohol. We ordered two orders of the fried pickles, though, because those were great! (And even here we had to flag down our waiter to place a second order and get extra ranch dip).  We will go back because of the convenient location and nice patio but we will have our expectations set appropriately."

The Canadian bacon, all so good. Also got a pita bread house made bruschetta. Wow, is that good. Diced tomatoes, with small cubes of mozzarella, and fresh basil. Deliciand shareable. Again I had the cherry limeade drink. It's perfect. The whole meal was fantastic. The waiter we had was super nice. This place is packed. So get there early. It's loud inside, but they have a large patio, but tonight it was chilly. No heat lamps. Parking lot is tight too. Been here twice and I think I took the last parking spot both time UPDATE: I've never been here for brunch, so today is the day! Chicken and waffles it is! I find chicken and waffles such a Southern thing, and I can't get enough of it. If it's on the menu, I'm ordering it. Their waffles are amazing. It's two small waffles with pockets of like brown sugar maybe? They have some kind of crunch to it. I didn't even use syrup because they just had a great flavor already. Chicken is tender and juicy. And it's a big piece of chicken breast. Bartenders are so Southern with their \"yes ma'am\" and hospitality. I always had a drink in front of me and I was checked in to make sure everything was to my liking. Pour House on Jollyville Road is such a great place to go alone or with a group. Their patio is outstanding, service is Southern as Southern can get. Always had a great meal, an even better cocktail, and the service is hands down Southern and hospitable. You have a great team here, this is my go to place"

Picked up 2 pizzas for myself and office manager. Her first response was that it seemed to be frozen pizza. I agreed. Pepperroni was sliced so thin it was almost tranparent transparent. Sauce and crust definitely seemed directly from the frozen section. My large greek salad was equally disappointing - very much so.  Counter staff was very friendly and courteous though."

Served with a spicy aioli) -  Roasted Mushroom Fettuccine (very fresh) - Charcuterie Board (if you're a cheese fan, P6 offers a high quality selection)  I've had the chance to try all of the cocktails here, and none have disappointed me."

                "description": "Visited P6 for happy hour with a friend while visiting Austin and had a good time! We arrived when they were just opening, and luckily we had a reservation - it filled up really quickly after a bit. The space has a great vibe and a great view - even though it's not on the roof, the space offers a lovely view of the city and river and the open concept of the bar makes for a perfect environment to relax and enjoy some sunshine. The space is filled with countless plants and pink decor, which I truly appreciated - it felt quite posh and eclectic yet incredibly put together at the same time.   For drinks, I opted for the ladybird spritz, perfect for a refreshing afternoon cocktail. Featuring rhubarb, aperol, and cava, it was light yet flavorful, really being able to taste the rhubarb throughout the entire drink. Quite good! My friend went for the sundown cobbler, which she also really enjoyed. Since it was happy hour, we snagged some food too. We both split the pita bread with chimichurri and the hummus. We were given a bunch of pita bread, which was much appreciated! The pita was good, but not the best I've ever had (a little dense for my liking). The chimchurri was OK - the ratio of oil to spices was a bit off so it felt like it was swimming in oil. The hummus was quite nice and featured a nice touch of cashews and chili oil. I appreciated the inclusion of various veggies in addition to the pita for a change of pace! The hummus overall was good, but again, not the best I've ever had, but still filling and delicious and balanced our drinks well. While the prices of the cocktails were quite discounted from normal, they were still a bit steep, but to be expected when you consider the ambience of the place.   Overall, we enjoyed our HH at P6! I really enjoyed by spritz and the hummus / chimichurri was a nice balance. The prices are a bit elevated, but to be expected in relation to the space. If you're looking for a nice HH spot for visitors to Austin, I would definitely suggest P6!"

This place has such beautiful decor and is on the rooftop/patio, so there is a beautiful backdrop of Lady Bird Lake. You will definitely be taking tons of photos here.  We made reservations just in case, but we pretty much had the whole restaurant to ourselves for the first hour P6 was opened. Everything looked delicious, so we ordered quite a bit:  Vegetable Frittata: This was perfect for a light meal. Lots of veggies and the eggs and butter lettuce was perfect.  Shrimp and Grits: Soooo bomb. Every bit of this tasted great. Just wished they would have removed the shrimp tails as most other places do.  Patatas Bravas: The potatoes were great for a side/appetizer.  Sourdough Garlic Bread: I love a good garlic bread, and this totally delivered. And I like that fact that it was pull-apart bread.   Everything tasted amazing and we really enjoyed our time brunching here."

But we convinced our way out to the patio early in the night which was better (but a little chilly). Why would we want to come to a rooftop bar if we can't be outside, ya know?!  The servers were nice - we had multiple throughout the night. They occasionally came and checked on us. The place was packed on a Friday night.  We all had a lot of fun here and the drinks just kept coming! They were tasty and swanky.  There weren't many parking options other than valet that I saw but I can't remember how much that was. We had to walk through the hotel to get to the rooftop. The hotel looked very nice with mood lighting and modern decor touches.  Overall though, P6 was great - moody and fun!"

(If you are interested in sitting outdoors - we were told reservations book out 1 week in advance so make sure to plan accordingly)  Even though the indoor space did not have the same ambience as outdoors it was still very nice and well decorated.   Service was very friendly and efficient.  For our brunch we decided to order:  --PATATAS BRAVAS: Well fried with a great flavor. Definitely a great brunch item to order! My only complaint would be they didn't really give us many potatoes since the portion covered less than half of the bowl it came in.   --FRITTATA: Ours was a veggie frittata that was filled with flavor and topped with a great tomato based purée. It did come with a giant handful of lightly coated romaine lettuce which seemed a bit mismatched. Additionally the portion of the frittata was slightly too small for the price.   --PICKLED PEARL ONION HUMMUS: Really good portion of food. The hummus is just bursting in flavor. There was also a ton of bread and veggies it comes with to dip into the hummus. Definitely a solid order!   All in all, a nice brunch option for the weekend if you are staying at The Line."

The plating of the carpaccio was gorgeous, and it had a beautiful mix of salty and fresh flavors. The pita chips that came with it were perfectly crispy too!  This was the best view we were able to get while in Austin, and can't wait to come back! But next time - we'll make it in time for their amazing happy hour deals."

Had a reservation for 6 and the hostess was able to accommodate my request of sitting outside, which I really appreciated. The ambiance is very pretty and totally Instagram worthy with their pink overhangs and colorful couches/decor. They also had semi-large fans for each outdoor table which was much needed in this Texas heat.   The food was really delicious and not too overly priced. For brunch, most of the plates were pretty small so, if you're hungry I would recommend ordering 1-3 plates and sharing if you have the ability to do so. We tried the Greek Yogurt Parfait, Patatas Bravas and Hummus and it was all sooo good! Will definitely be returning here."

Im not a huge drinker, but I really enjoyed my drink and loved that there was fruit in it. The pita bread was incredible! I loved how soft and warm the pita was. It was perfect with the chimichurri.  Parking- You can park in the garage for the hotel, but they only validate for the first hour I believe, which is only $5. Luckily we found street parking next to the garage which isn't nearly as expensive.  Payment- I actually really loved that you paid online! It makes it very easy to split the check amongst friends without bothering the servers!"

                "description": "Views are excellent... IF you even get a table anywhere near them. This restaurant is poorly executed in my opinion. They have beautiful views of the river but there is no guarantee that you will even be able to see it from your table (even with reservations) and yet you're still paying \"fancy view prices\".   My experience: - Arrived at The Line Hotel (which is way cool btw) to find that there are no signs on how to get to P6.  - The elevator is super sketchy and in the back corner without any airflow at all (seemed like an afterthought or service elevator). - Originally was sat at a \"table\" (their seating are little vignettes of couches/patio furniture that is NOT comfortable AT ALL and really impractical to eat at) nowhere near the view. The tiny view that we did have was completely obstructed by a shade they rolled down. - We asked to be moved to a \"table\" with a view and were finally re-seated but still had a difficult time seeing the view as we were further back at a SUPER low to the ground vignette.  - The staff was friendly but the drinks and the menu items were overrated. - Stayed for an hour and a half, took some pictures, and went somewhere else to eat more food.  My order: - Sundown Cobbler cocktail - Yummy, but tasted mostly like sprite. - Paper Plane cocktail - Yummy, smooth, easy drinker. - Whipped ricotta - Way more food than we expected but the olives and the nuts were better than the ricotta. It lacked a lot of flavor and mostly just helped to fill me up.  Long story short - NOT worth the hype."

The menu is petit and this venue is built for drinks and small apps. However, dinner was good and the views breathe taking. The evening was an overall success and the service was helpful. Strongly recommend for a predinner or after dinner spot."

We went at 6;30pm and it was HOT so I recommend going a little later in the evening when it's cooler- we loved the live music, amazing views of the lake, the cocktails, but mostly our server Cammy (I think that was her name) but she was amazing and really spoiled our friend for his birthday! Giving this 5 stars for the service- I highly recommend ordering the summer Sandie it was delicious!"

Somewhere I'd recommend for anyone looking to enjoy an intimate moment with some of the best drinks in the city. The view is spectacular, just stunning. The food options are a little limited due to their kitchen size, but we were still able to find a few suitable options. I'd recommend the place mainly for the beautiful view."

They were fully booked on opentable but I called ahead and the hostess kindly reserved us a spot right by the water.  If we're being honest you mostly come here for the view and the ambiance.  However, everything I ate and drank was also really great.  Pro tip: try to arrive between 4-5 so you can order your first drink off their \"happiest hour\" menu.  My only complaint here is parking.  You can self park for up to 3 hours in the parking garage of The Line hotel and get it validated for $10, or you can find street parking yourself.  I personally don't mind hunting for street parking, but if you're coming with a group make sure your party knows what to expect.  It is downtown after all!"

P6 is beautiful for snacks and light drinks, but there was absolutely nothing I would return for (except the views). Each dish is shared with the table. For a table of 3 ladies, we ordered the Riviera Pastry Basket, Patatas Bravas, Spanikopita, the Seasonal Vegetable Frittata, and a pitcher of White Sangria. The Pastry Basket, Patatas, and the Frittata were incredibly dry and bland-- overcooked. I love a good crisp, white sangria, but this sangria tasted like water mixed with fruits...   Stay for the views, stay away from the menu."

You're paying for the vibes and views, FYI. -Good pastries - loved the pastry basket -Friendly staff - shoutout to Gabriela (I hope I got her name right, the hostess!) who was so kind -Fun drink options / quick service  -Tables felt spaced out well   Cons: -You have to pay $10 for self-parking, and that's the validated price  -There's an automatic gratuity regardless of party size (not a big deal) and 3% \"Covid surcharge for health and safety measures\" which none of it goes to staff.  I'd be great with it if it included hazard pay, but considering they were all wearing their own masks and they were only spraying down tables, it seemed pretty shady to me.   Overall, good for a special occasion I'd say."

And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

                "description": "I finally tried this place and so glad I did! Went with some girlfriends for some much needed quality girl time. This was the perfect place to sit back, chill and enjoy great food and company. I really like the ambience of this restaurant. It boasts a laid back feel with the dim lighting, yet has an open atmosphere. I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and everything was cooked to perfection. The salmon was cooked on the medium side to my liking and request to the server. We also ordered the James Bowie Nachos. Keep in mind these are not the typical Tex-Mex nachos, but they were still delicious and flavorful with a hint of robust BBQ flavor. There is an option to add chicken or steak and we opted for the chicken...great choice! If you love spicy (I sure do), they have a kick to them, as they are topped with freshly sliced jalapenos. Our server was excellent! She was so friendly, accommodating and checked on us frequently. She alone deserves a 5-star recognition! Try this place that offers locally-sourced, high quality food with its own, unique flavor."

I guess that means I'll have to make up for lost time. We got the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. There was a sweetness to it with the apples and honey and candied pecans. So good! For dinner, I got the Pan-Seared Chicken and had to say yes to that when I saw that the chicken was on top of risotto, my favorite. The chicken was a small piece but very flavorful. I got the tots and also some chili which was spicy! Thanks The Republic, great place. I gotta get one of your large cocktails next time too."

They were out of fried salmon (odd bc they had the other way?) or I would have gotten that since you can basically get a shrimp taco anywhere. I'll definitely be back for taco Tuesday again. It was a little cold, I like my food room temperature so it was perfect for me, but I could see someone being disappointed in the temperature of the food. But I'm not knocking off any stars for that since that's how I like my food."

                "description": "Came here for dinner on Tuesday night 6/15/21 with some family. I ordered the El Cesar Chavez salad with salmon and when they food came out the first bite I took I was fishing a bone out of my mouth from the salmon. So I started to inspect the rest of the fish and found 3 more bones. I informed our waitress and she kindly had it re made but when the second salmon came out I once again found 2 more fish bones inside.   At this point I did not receive an apology nor did a manager come by to check in to if everything was okay so I asked to speak to one and inform him. The gentlemen came over and apologized but really did not seem genuine about it after I explained how dangerous it was that I found a total of 6 fish bones that I could have choked on. He also attempted to blame the chef for not cleaning it right and saying \"I always tell him to make sure all the bones are out.\"   Coming from the restaurant business myself and having my husband be on the corporate side of a big restaurant chain - I was very disappointed in how this place dealt with the issue.   Please check your seafood at this place - they clearly are not ordering boneless seafood or properly cleaning they're fish."

As soon as we walked in here, I was drawn to the huge mural and the Japanese-style seating. I love that they have flights to really give you a chance to try some different flavors. Ordering at the bar was easy, and the bartender explained things well and gave us good explanations. We even purchased some snacks to eat with our sake. Although I probably won't choose this place as a destination in itself, I hope to be back when I am over in this complex (which has so much to offer!)."

I even bought cans to go.  For the sake flight, you get four tasting and the for the sparkling, you get three.  The tasting room is big. Plenty of seating.  If you're hungry, there's a food truck right outside."

                "description": "This review is for 3.5 stars.   As far as a unique experience goes, Texas Sake Co hits the marks. Random Japanese centric spot in the middle of the Yard. Sumo on tv, umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, and sake galore. Nice outdoor seating area out front adds an Austin flare.   But the sake was just not good. Ordered the flight and only finished 1 of the 4 5oz pours. About $20 for high quantity, but there was so much oak and smokiness that it didn't resemble any type of sake I've had in my life. The cloudy unfiltered sake with yuzu on special for the day was edible but the rest were actually off. And on top of that, the booths are just impossible to get in and out of. Supposed to be the old school Asian variety but they're not built for people with long legs and there's zero room to scooch in.   Experience was fine and love the vibe of the Yard, but just couldn't get down with the drinks or seating."

They had a front outside area with a few games to play and misters to keep cool. I can not forget to tell y'all they have snacks as well. Chocolate cookie pandas that were delicious and I took home some dried up edamame that I want to go back for more lol   They also sell their sake to take home any of your faves you tried and they are also very reasonably priced."

                "description": "A small batch sake distillery in Texas?!?!?  YES!  I really wanted to like this spot, but our visit was just OK. The staff didn't know where their rice was sourced and seemed disorganized.  Surprisingly, there are rice farmers in Texas along the lower Colorado river (https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/tag/texas-rice-farming/).  They started farming rice in the 19th century.  Unfortunately, no one was knowledgeable enough to confirm or deny the rice's source.    The spot is hard to find. Just drive to the back of all the strip mall (behind Book Women), and you will finally get there.  There is plenty of parking available.  The tasting room is small, dingy, and dark.  You can peer into the production facility in the back of the tasting room.  There are only a couple of seats around the tasting room bar, and some standing tables.  Thankfully there was a makeshift outdoor seating area in the parking lot area with tents and picnic tables.  You can select from a tasting flight, Sake cocktails, or a shot glass size of their sake.  Bottle purchase are also possible.  We tried their clear, and milky white sake. It came with a bowl of pretzels. The clear sake was OK.  The milky white sake was unique, and actually better than the first.  But, both were subpar to other sakes that I have had.    We were supposed to take a tour. They offer tours at 7pm, 8pm, and 9pm on Friday and Saturday.  We showed up in time to attend the 7pm, but as it got closer to 8pm, we asked about the tour.  There is only so long you can nurse an OK glass of sake. They said it would happen in 3 minutes.  By the time 8:16m rolled around we peaced out.    The one thing that we learned was that the ownership had changed a couple of years before, and it was now being run by the same people who own StrangeLand Brewery.  Wonder how that changed the experience and quality.  Was surprised to see this place rated so highly."

                "description": "This place was awesome!  I'm an out of towner and I've never had too much sake aside from ordering a \"hot sake\" from sushi restaurants, which I've always enjoyed.  When I heard about this place, I couldn't wait to try.  We got there at dark, and it looked unassuming aside from some lights hanging overhead, a few picnic tables, and a cornhole set up, and even the inside isn't too different from what you'd expect from a basic distillery.  I ordered the sample flight of sake so I could try a bunch of different things and actually learn something about sake while I was there.  The staff that was working was super friendly and great about answering any questions we had.  When he brought out the flights, he explained what each one was like and what to expect from it.  Despite my five star review, I didn't like all of the sake on the flight, but the point was to try a bunch of different types!  The sample flight came with four different types of sake - Junmai, Nigori, Nama, and Oak.  My two favorites were the Junmai and the Nigori, with the Junmai being most similar to the basic \"hot sake\" I'd always had before and the Nigori being a really smooth sake.  The Nama, in my opinion, was really strong, so it wasn't really for my tastes.  The Oak also felt a bit strong, but it was tempered by the oak-y taste that came with it.  We were also offered a taste of their Blood Orange CBD infused sake, which had really intrigued me.  It didn't taste like I had expected any sake to taste like, but I really enjoyed it!  I would definitely love to come back the next time I'm in town and try the tour to learn even more!"

I approached the bar and the bartender came up to me.  I told him that it was my first time here and what should I do - order at the bar, sit at table, wait to be seated, etc....  His reply, \"Buy sake\".  That was rude to me.  I ordered a flight and sat down annoyed.  Then, the sake.  It was VERY watered down.  I did not taste well.  Great space but that's all it's got going for it."

                "description": "My first visit to Texas Saké Company (TSC) was such a delight I could not wait to share it. I had no idea we had our own secret saké brewery (or kura) here in Austin!   While originally founded in 2011, the place re-launched in December 2015 under new ownership (including some of the guys behind Strangeland Brewing). Since March 2016, they have been serving happy customers in the onsite TSC tasting room, as well as selling bottles of its small batch productions to local stores, restaurants, and anyone else who enjoys the diverse world of saké. If you shop at Central Market, HEB, or in.gredients, you can pick up a bottle or two there, too.  I was fortunate to recently attend a special event at TSC (Thanks, Amy D. and Our ATX!) in which we were able to taste a flight of 4 different types of saké (each one more delicious than the last), as well as to tour the brew room. Toji (brew master) Jeff explained the TSC brew process and schooled us all in Saké 101. A surprise to me was the oak-aged junmai, which immediately had me thinking of smoke and bourbon - I'd love to show up to the next BBQ picnic with this one. If you are new to saké, don't be scared! The flavors of the TSC brews are intended to appeal to a wide range of palates and adventurous drinkers are sure to find one to like.  FYI, TSC is a local, small biz, craft operation, so retail hours can be sporadic (or have been during the recent transition to new owners and processes). Current tasting room hours are Fri-Sat, 6p-11p, but it's always best to call 844.438.8392 and/or check social media for any scheduling changes and special tasting events onsite and around town. https://www.facebook.com/txsake https://www.instagram.com/texassakecompany/ https://twitter.com/txsake  Finding the place is a little tricky. Follow your map to Book Woman on North Lamar just south of Koenig. Turn onto Nelray Blvd and park on the street or in the lot just behind the Book Woman building (next to Travis County Strength gym). The small door into TSC is right next to the number 115 on the wall of the large, tan warehouse-looking structure."

                "description": "Texas Sake Company is a neat concept insomuch as domestically brewed craft sake is a rarity.  I got a texas flight of 4 sake varieties.  Junmai- Smooth. Not much depth of flavor. Off finish. Not enough alcohol content.  Junmai Nigori- Milky mouthfeel. More alcohol content. Slight sweetness. Smooth.   Junmai Nama- Some effervescence. Not very sweet. Not much flavor. Lacking nuance.  Junmai Oak Aged- Sweetness is odd. Taste almost smokey. Caramel note. Oaky finish.    The nigori sake was definitely the standout for tasting like sake, and having the proper milky feel and alcohol taste one expects from sake. The nama is also a satisfactory take on sake, Again, I appreciate having a domestic sake producer that wants to take a craft approach. However, I am sad to say the sake comes off as amateur. The classic junmai is missing an alcoholic undertone, which is a common symptom of homebrewed alcohol. The oak sake is ambitious but really needs to be aged in an oak barrel. Adding wood chips makes is a shortcut that makes it taste cheap.  If you visit Texas Sake Company, I recommend sticking with the nigori and nama sake."

It is a pretty small and chill place and there is only 1 bartender so please be patient when waiting for your drinks. Last night I had the peach junmai and the oakey old fashioned. I love me a good old fashioned and this one is pretty good. They also have an apple pie cocktail and matcha cocktail on the menu. You can also get a saké flight so you can try 4 different types. They do distillery tours but I've never been on one. Definitely give this chill place a shot and support this business!"

                "description": "This pandemic has taken us all for a ride. The folks at Better Half had a nice and cozy building then a worldwide pandemic hit that required you to avoid that.exact.environment.  And they rolled with it.   On several occasions, we used their pickup and it was great. They were efficient, considerate (all the utensils and napkins) and the food was always good considering we would eat it while parked at Zilker.  Well, we finally decided to eat there this time. They have an awesome covered...tent or something, that fits up to 60 folks. They even had a heater blowing in that thing!!  And the food, whew. The grilled halloumi plate was so creative, we loved the mix of flavors. The spicy chicken sandwich was different than at other places, in a good way. I left trying to place all the flavors and can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.  A cool bonus is the view from the parking lot. I was able to take a quick picture."

                "description": "Possibly the rudest customer service I've experienced in Austin. There was a drink mixup and instead of accommodating us, they were rude and accusatory of us, as if we were trying to steal drinks from them. When in reality, the mixup happened because their waitstaff doesn't know what their food and drink items are by looking at them. They would just put the items down on the table and walk away. Instead of remedying the issue, eyes were rolled at us, and we were told if we want something else we needed to come inside to the bar and \"pay for it ourselves\".   We also had brought a birthday cake. It's an outdoor coffee shop and bar with a super casual atmosphere. When I asked if we could use some utensils, they told me that I shouldn't have a cake on the premises (which is \"standard for restaurants\") and that it would be $15 for us to use their forks and/or consume the cake on site. They said I should have called ahead. If it was a nice sit down restaurant and not a bar that has a Sunday brunch, I would have.   Again, this is an OUTDOOR coffee shop and bar. We had a big group of 20 people who all bought a ton of food and drinks, and we were treated like we were taking advantage. We were super patient (I've worked in customer service and know how awful people can be, so I always treat waitstaff with respect. But this is not that).   Never coming back."

Great place for a morning coffee with friends!"

I was not a big fan of the donut balls i tried, though they were hot and possibly freshly made. They were a little dry and dull for my taste . The breakfast sandwich was amazing too and they had a vegan meat option which is wonderful. Plenty parking, which is a plus in Austin and great outdoor seating too. Will go back again!"

Overall highly recommend the place. Great outdoor space as well."

Parking was also relatively easy since they have their own parking lot. They have happy hour Tues-Fri and Sunday 3-6pm, with $6 burgers! They also have reverse happy hour 9-10pm daily (also $6 burgers). The patio is very dog friendly and there is a self-serve water jug as well to help yourself. The food was delicious and a good portion for the price."

The portion was smaller than expected but the food was really good - the had browns were crispy and the Parmesan with the sunny side up egg paired really well with their gravy. I liked how the pickled onions added a sour kick to the gravy, but preferred the dish without the onions.   Would definitely come again and sit outdoors, if the weather permits!"

We went on Labor Day so it was quite busy and took probably a good 40 minutes to get our food, but it was absolutely worth every minute of the wait.  The Pastrami Sandwich had the best, smokiest pastrami I've ever had and everything from the mushrooms to the bread to the berbere horseradish sauce was just so well executed and damn delicious.   The Big Springy salad was a nice healthier contrast that still tasted interested and decadent (okaay, we added fried chicken, that might not be the healthiest). It was a little light on the cojita-chimichurri dressing so we got some more, and I just wanted to jello shot that condiment cup straight into my mouth it was so good.  I started off with the chagacinno and while it was a tad sweet for my preference, it was still absolutely delicious as well."

I had heard this place was one of the best breakfast spots in Austin and it did not disappoint!   I ordered the chicken biscuit and completely cleaned my plate not a crumb left! I will say the chicken was slightly salty but nothing i couldn't handle. The chicken tastes like it might be brined that would be my guess as to the extra salt (not sure if they use a brine or not). The cocktail was pretty good too went well with the sandwich.   From the description I was thinking there was going to be a spicy marmalade sauce on the side to dip the biscuit in which would've been amazing but nonetheless still a very good breakfast sandwich will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Austin!"

I absolutely love the backyard patio vibes - seems like a very chill spot to just hang out and chat.  I don't really recommend coming here to study or do work as this place can get quite rowdy. The same owners also opened a brewery right next doors called Hold Out Brewing, so you can slowly transition from productivity to drunken stupor if that's your thing."

                "description": "Better Half Coffee and Cocktails belongs in the book of Austin AF restaurants. What does that even mean? Innovative menu using fresh ingredients with high prices.   Our table of 3 split the entrees and shared as easy apps to get the full experience of the brunch AND lunch menu. For brunch, we ordered the Waffle Iron Hashbrown, which was literally a plate of overcooked hashbrowns, topped with coffee and cream gravy, cotija cheese, an egg, pickled onions and scallions. Sadly, this was just basic to me (or as Gen Z calls it Cheugy). Nothing that I would die for...  For lunch, we ordered the Vermicelli Salad, the Chilled Ramen, and a side of the Cauliflower Tots. I could not get enough of the Vermicelli Salad and strangely the Cauliflower Tots! The Vermicelli Salad was refreshing and light, and I enjoyed the Pineapple \"Fish\" Sauce substitute they use to make this dish vegan friendly!! The Cauliflowers admittedly looked like burnt bite-sized toast when it arrived, but as soon as I dipped it in the beet ketchup, I couldn't put my fork down.   BEWARE! If you order any of the Frozen Sloppee Frozen Cocktails, this thing will mess you up (in the best form possible). I would advise ordering with caution! The Spicy Peach'arita was my poison of choice, and though delicious, if you add Texas heat, it will melt fast and have you only tasting tequila!"

For eats, I got a biscuit with avo and the cauli tots- like the cauliflower, not the beet ketchup, but I'm not a beet girl.  Great space.  Great color scape.

Flavor is everywhere in it and it's smoked to perfection. 100% must try.    The burger is off the chain as well, super fresh and clearly made with care and intention.   Service: ASK FOR Kyle, he's seriously the bomb.   the people here are super friendly and after my second visit they knew me by name. Very welcoming and give great menu advice.

We started off with a brunch drink that I can't remember the name of, it had champagne and vodka, but it I was really good.   I was eyeing their creamsicle latte, but I wasn't in the current mood for a coffee drink, so sorry I can't tell you about it. It looked good though. They have some very interesting selections for coffee that I'd love to come back and try.   Food- we ordered the cauliflower tots with beet ketchup. It comes out looking like tofu and the taste is very good. The beet ketchup is a nice addition. My husband got the hash browns topped with Cojita gravy. The gravy was so good, the hash browns were cooked to hard, but a easy fix for next time. For the table we got the Pastrami Chips and Queso, that tasted like a brisket. I got a summer salad which was probably the only thing that we had that was meh. My friend had the chicken biscuit in which she said was really good. All in all I would like to come back again as their menu had some interesting items on it, a good looking happy hour and for the most part the food didn't disappoint."

Honestly one of the best chips and queso apps in Austin thus far. Both elements were fantastic.    The breakfast burrito isn't the largest thing in the world so if you're hungry make sure to get a side or an app along with it.   Will definitely come back.   There was a time limit on our table which wasn't preferred and the tables themselves weren't amazingly comfortable."

We got there an hour before our appt and host was very accommodating and sat us early. Not to mention we had our 4 month old in a stroller. We took the option to sit outside because the weather was great and they have an awesome patio. The waiter was very nice and very knowledgeable on the whole food menu and drinks. We wanted get something light since we have been eating so heavy on our vaca.   We split 3 dishes a ceviche, the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. All the 3 were very light, tasty and delicious!! It was exactly what we were looking for.   I would absolutely recommend this place!"

                "description": "Food was decent, but the parking situation ruined our experience and we likely won't return as a result.   There is a parking garage behind Perlas where they supposedly validate your parking. Apparently there is a new system in place in the parking garage that requires you to scan a QR code to pay for parking then somehow you get it validated at the restaurant. However, when you pull into the garage there is no QR code. So I walked to the restaurant to ask how to validate parking. They gave me the QR code but I had to have my license plate. So I had to walk back to my truck to get license plate. By the time I got back to my truck there was already a parking ticket on my truck!   I reached out to the manger of this parking garage, Travis, to explain the situation, but he refused to waive the parking ticket even though I showed him a copy of my receipt from Perlas which proves that my parking should have been free not to mention the confusing process."

                "description": "Service was professional and prompt. The server, Donovan, was quite excellent at providing suggestions and information without need to go back and consult a chef or manager. What this says is that the restaurant (and chef) ensure the employees taste what they serve so they can provide info to diners. This is one mark of excellence.   The setting is beautiful. Since it was a pleasant autumn day, we opted for outdoor dining and enjoyed our decision. It's hard to write about the vibe but this is closer to a low-key fine dining. It isn't fancy but the food and service make it close.   We had grilled (or broiled) oysters and they were as good as the ones I had at Felix's in the French Quarter. We also had a sampler of oysters in the half-shell and we were guided by Donovan who knew the types of oysters and sources and showed us that by flipping the shell, the underside gives clues as to the waters they originated from.   Tuna Tartare was excellent (I've only had it as good in Aspen, Co for 3x the price).  Then smoked octopus and grilled red snapper. Both of those were outstanding too.   Price is reasonable for the quality but our bill was over $175 (we ate a ton and didn't care) this restaurant is right on price considering the quality on the plate and from the staff. We will definitely go again."

Jacob, my server, was incredible and every dish he recommended was beyond amazing! It was totally worth the flight. This is huge for me because customer service in my opinion, has declined drastically, so when I rave about an experience such as Perla's, it's #facts! This evening I enjoyed some glasses of Chenin Blanc, from South Africa, some delicious oysters (Jacob chose all of them), fried okra, crab cake and the famous potato crusted sea bass and a sea salt dessert! Thanks Perla's for the amazing experience! Thanks for the warm welcome from the staff outside and the lovely hostesses inside. I'll certainly be back and cannot wait! Be safe. Be blessed. Be kind and enjoy good food! Perla's"

                "description": "Been waiting a while to go here, and finally got to make it while it was still nice out; We thought there was supposed to be a happy hour, but it turns out/doesn't seem like there is one anymore unfortunately.  Naturally, we got a few appetizers, oyster shooters and oysters, plus the octopus that came with a savory sauce and potatoes. I'm not a fan of bloody mary's so the shooter wasn't my favorite since that's how they were prepared, and kind of spendy at that. The oysters were a small bit still good; again,  no happy hour pricing.  The octopus was my favorite, grilled perfectly, same as the potatoes, covered in herbs and a butter/mayo sauce that paired nicely.   We both got fish, mine had a bit of spice to it, and the ahi was very nice and fresh; Overall, pleasant meal, more expensive than we would've liked but glad to have tried it. Personally, I think it's better to just get some appetizers/drinks and save the entree for somewhere else; while it's definitely good, I think it's overpriced and could make something comparable for a fraction of the cost."

                "description": "Our first time here for an occasion with my wife's second cousins. Two guests split a dozen oysters and loved them. We split the calamari and it was among the best we've had in Texas. Top two, maybe top five ever. My wife had the redfish on the half shell and loved it. I ordered an oyster Po Boy but was disappointed in the size of the oysters and was very salty. The shoe string fries were fine by my tastes despite what some reviews state. Kind of high price for what we got for lunch but that's what you get now with the CA invasion of Austin. Seafood seemed fresh which is rare in Texas."

The last time we went was for lunch on a Tuesday and we waited about 30 minutes for an outdoor table, but it's always worth it! The place has a really cool vibe and the staff is very pleasant and we appreciate the mask policy. The oysters are delicious! We usually get the calamari, octopus and fries as well. I will say the octopus is a tad too salty for me, but otherwise the food is good."

However, it was really nice outside so the sweet staff moved us out there upon asking. We came for my birthday dinner and it was a very relaxing, chill, but a little upscale vibe. We all wore jeans and it was totally acceptable. The food was 10/10. The calamari was light and crispy at the same time- just perfect. The creole oysters were packed with flavor, and the main dish lobster bucatini was literally the best dish I've ever had. It was delicious and that alone is enough for me to return. We split it which I think was perfect because I could barely finish my half after the appetizers.  We will definitely be back!"

First, I wouldn't recommend dining with family. It is too expensive and there's not a lot to select on the menu for the younger ones. It's definitely a date night or girls/guys night out vibe.   Red snapper dish was ok. Brussels sprouts were good, had a sweet taste. The prawns were good and I do recommend the calamari for an appetizer.  Complimentary hush puppies were a nice treat, too.   Cocktails were a little watered down for the price. Wine was decent.   Loved the outdoor seating area. If I go back, it will be for a glass of wine and calamari on the patio."

Parking wasn't easy for the area and I wish I had known the restaurant validates. I could have saved $10. Overall the service and atmosphere was satisfying. The brunch menu is not huge but the few items available still left me struggling to decide. I chose the lobster omelette and it was one of the fluffiest omelette's I ever had. Each bite was full of crab. I initially thought the lettuce was a garnish but took a bite and it was a salad with some of the best dressing I ever had. Oh and the grilled oysters are a MUST!

First we were sat ALONE in the outdoor patio which we really enjoyed, we then had a wonderful waiter who was very funny,super helpful and gave us some great recommendations on flavor combinations for desserts. The food was insane and each course was brought out at the perfect time. We both get full very quickly and the time in between each course gave us enough time to digest a bit but we were never hungry. We were super full by the end of the night and spent $230.78 including tip and we ate a good amount of food(We got the Japanese milk rolls,grilled octopus, the Halibut, the NY Strip, Brussels Sprouts, crushed potatoes, 2 apple frangipane tarts, the sticky toffee pudding and the chocolate caramel Breton. We also got 3 cocktails). Thank you for making our day so special, We will 100% be coming back!!"

Prior to my going,  I did see many favorable reviews regarding the Eggs Benedict however, none mentioned Braised Collar Greens.  Yes!  Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.  I'm a HUGE fan of vegetables but let's just say that after trying it at Eberly, I'm NOT a fan of Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.    I'll be back, Eberly."

They had multiple seating areas and a bar when you step in with plenty of space to walk around. The whole restaurant is designed elegantly and has wood features on the bar. I am really curious to see what it's like functioning normally.  The event had a lot of food, they served us BBQ with a full spread. The brisket, Mac n cheese and potato salad were my favorites. I have no idea if it was catered or if the restaurant made it, but it was really good.  They had a DJ downstairs with awesome decor and lights. Upstairs is Cedar Tavern, which I think maybe partners with Eberly or is owned by the same people? It was a good drinking area, with games and a mechanical bull. They had Symply Courtney hosting the mechanical bull rides and he was very entertaining. We talked to him after the show and he was super nice as well.   There was also a guy doing lasso tricks with a rope! I did not catch his name but, he was very talented.   The rest of the staff was really awesome too.   Overall 10/10 event, would definitely do another NYE here and am super curious to try the restaurant on a normal basis."

Our evening was just perfect, from the Service, Meal - Starters to Dessert, Wine to Post dinner drinks at the bar.   The reason for 4 stars not 5, the vegetarian pasta entree didn't deliver, the menu description had potential, what I was served paled disappointingly in comparison to everything else that graced our table.   I just noticed that the menu has changed just like our season has. Dinner date anyone? :)"

We started with the beef tartare, good but I would be open to other starters (not a must have for me). My husband had the wagyu for dinner and I had the mushroom mafaldini...which was amazing!! Loved it!! We finished with the chocolate caramel Breton...strong flavors that paired together very nicely!! Such unique dessert!!"

My water cup was never empty and they continuously checked in on us to see how we were doing. The short ribs were so tender and melts in your mouth. The crispy potatoes were huge and more than enough for two people. Overall this was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and try the pasta."

                "description": "We came here for a special occasion, and I will say the service side of things was fantastic for that. We were given a card signed by the entire staff (and printed with today's date so we knew it hadn't just been pulled from a stack) and two free glasses of champagne that we could tell was nice quality. At the end of the meal, they also brought out two small plates of dessert on the house, and it was delicious! Tasted sort of like an apple crisp, and really beautifully plated. I'm kicking myself for not having taken a picture of it.  I also really have to compliment our waiter, who said he had some level of sommelier training and had contributed to the wine list. He pointed us to a bottle of 2016 \"Sucette,\" a grenache from \"An Approach to Relaxation,\" a small vineyard in Australia. I'd never had a pure grenache and had never been a fan of GSM blends, but this bottle was absolutely lovely. It's hard to find online, and I love it when I can get a bottle at a restaurant that I can't just pick up at my local liqueur store...makes it more worth the mark-up.  So, service was five stars, all the way. Really nice.  The letdown was the food. First, they were out of the short rib. Guys...this was a special occasion, and I came all the way from Dallas for the short rib. Don't do me like that! I mean...the thought of walking out honestly crossed my mind. Instead, I took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the halibut. It was...fine. No short rib. We also shared the Wagyu sirlion, which honestly wasn't all that remarkable either. For sides, we did the asparagus (very nice) and the shells and cheese (also nice). Oh, and we started with the octopus, which also was nicely prepared. And then, yeah, heck, we went for it and ordered a full dessert in addition to the free mini desserts they gave us. The Chocolate Bar was...eh. Chocolatey? Nothing memorable, really.  At the end of the day, our bill was as sky-high as you might expect with a bottle of nice wine, two entrees (one being Wagyu steak), two sides, and a dessert. However, we both left feeling as though the food really hadn't lived up to the cost. We agreed that if we were going to drop that much money on a meal, we would have much rather gone next door to Uchi...and that's just not a great feeling.  I really do have to compliment the staff and their phenomenal attention to our special occasion. They earned those three stars all on their own. I wish the food had supported a higher rating, but it just fell short of expectations."

If you're looking for a nice restaurant, cool vibe, great food and don't mind the price tag that comes along with it, this is a great place for a date or dinner with friends.   Our group of friends went to Eberly most recently for a birthday celebration and we had the Japanese milk rolls, salmon poke, grilled octopus, short rib, wagyu steak, and shells and cheese. Everyone loved their entree! The grilled octopus and salmon poke blew us away - great starter dishes that I would highly recommend to any group going here.   The dessert was also great, we had the shortcake followed by a round of espresso martinis.   Great food, great vibe, great service. Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "I am honored to have experienced dining in at Eberly. This restaurant is simply amazing. All their food is fresh and high quality.   For appetizers, I would recommend all the starters. Although, if you have to narrow your choices, my top picks would be the Japanese rolls (dinner rolls), the steamed mussels, and the croquettes. Honestly though, everything is so amazing here that you won't be disappointed.  As for the main course, the short rib with polenta was incredible. The meat was fatty, soft, and full of flavor. It melted in your mouth.   Our server for the night was really great too and took their time to ensure we had all our dining needs met.   Unfortunately, what's preventing me from giving this restaurant a 5 out of 5 is that around 1030 after finishing our meal we wanted to go to the bar in the restaurant for some drinks and we were unable to do so. The bar was basically empty and the bartender told us we had to ask the host if we could sit for a drink at the empty bar. We went to go ask the host if we could sit and they said they would find out. We stood at the front waiting for 15 minutes for them to come back with an answer and they said \"you can sit at the bar but can only have 1 drink because we close at 11.\"   It took them 15 minutes to basically say no to sitting at their empty bar. Also, why would you tell us there's a drink limit? What if I can drink more than one drink in 15 minutes? I am disappointed I didn't get to finish my night at Eberly's bar.   I do recommend their restaurant but probably not the bar since they don't like to seat people at their empty bar."

It reminds me of Mad Men meets a speakeasy and I AM SO INTO IT.  My group's order: Cocktails: - Brooklynite - So smooth and delicious! Little tropical escape in a glass without the sugar punch. - Tristessa - Deliciously smokey and sweet, oh so good. - Sixteen Jackies - Favorite drink of the night! So pleasant and gentle you can barely taste any alcohol! - Autumn Rhythm - Classy, sophisticated, and the ice even has Eberly etched on it!  Food: - Japanese Milk Rolls - Its not hard to make bread absolutely divine but this really is something that I am now craving everyday... - Potato Leek Croquettes - Crispy but smooth on the inside with a pack of flavor in every bite. - Agnolotti - Vegetarians rejoice, these tiny pasta pillows are so delicious and tons of veggies to pair with it! - Asparagus - Sides can feed 2 people so share with the table! Cooked to perfection and so juicy. - Halibut - Fresh, moist, and every bit as healthy as you want it to be! - Braise Short Rib - Slightly dry unfortunately but otherwise epic flavors and the polenta was cooked to perfection. - Sticky Toffee Pudding - Wow this really was a perfect way to end the night! Please try this!  Long story short, GO TO EBERLY."

The reason I give it only 4 stars, is the the food was just good, and not great. When you are paying almost 100 dollars a person including drinks, you expect the food to be excellent. We had the fish and the wagyu sirloin. There was nothing wrong with the food, but it just didn't wow us. The wagyu tasted like a normal filet. Very lean but tender. It wasn't any tastier. I would have much rather have a prime ribeye for the same price."

The interior is gorgeous, especially if you are seating in the glass enclosed room.  10/10 for ambiance and design.  The cocktails are also great!  I've never had a drink here I didn't like.  Unfortunately, the food is where things go a bit south.  The portions are quite small and I find the quality to be inconsistent between dishes.  The price is also pretty high compared to other restaurants in the area.  That being said, the service has always been exceptional.  I think this place would be a lot better if they knocked a few bucks off their food prices (or improved the food)."

                "description": "TLDR: This is a great spot for a celebratory evening, but is overpriced and shouldn't be your \"go to date night\".  We went to Eberly to celebrate a friends job promotion. The ambiance was great. We sat in what felt kind of like a beautiful greenhouse. Plants everywhere, cute decor, and perfect lighting. The service was also great. Our waiter took great care of us the whole time. Everyone enjoyed the cocktails and drinks they ordered too.   The menu is not huge and every entree is over $21 a person some going up to $42. This price was okay for a celebration dinner, but it felt like a lot for the portion sizes.   Also, we ordered a side of the crushed potatoes and they were covered in mint. I personally dislike mint and the menu did not say the potatoes would be topped with it or I would not have ordered it. I was surprised and disappointed by my side order."

                "description": "In the latest wave of gentrification in this town, it seems like all I can find are hipster breweries that serve \"craft\" beer and overpriced food served on rectangular plates. If you like that kind of crap, go to aqua brew, you animal. If you want to go somewhere with cheap drinks and cool people (and if you live north of campus like this guy), look no further than Treff's. Some highlights.  You call it nights and you call it week:  Every Sunday, Treff's does $2.50 you call its, and $2.00 you call its on Tuesday. In addition to that, Treff's picks one week out of every month to be You call it week. That means $2 you call its all week. Going there, getting piss drunk, and stumbling back to my apartment, is among my fondest memories.   Atmosphere:  This place is dirty and divey in the best of ways. I used to go here with my friend from work all the time, and I always enjoyed seeing the bartenders and regulars. Really interesting people. Another upside is the patio, which allows filthy smokers like myself to smoke, drink, and have interesting conversations with other people. Another thing to mention, though, is that Treff's is much more of working people's bar. If you're a frat bro or sorority girl looking to blow mommy and daddy's money on a night of partying, you probably won't have a lot in common with the people here.  The glasses: This is just a little nitpick of mine, but I always hate going to the square and getting served drinks in a plastic cup. Treff's gets ridiculously busy some nights, and they still manage to serve all of their booze in glass, which is something I like. On another note, the bartenders here are absolute rock stars, and they don't take shit from anyone.   I haven't gone in a while since I don't have anyone to go with, but you can bet your ass the first place I'm taking my girlfriend when she turns 21 is gonna be Treff's."

A few minutes later another friend met up with us and brought a round of shots. Within 10 minutes of being there a bouncer came up to us and told us we need to leave because we were \"too drunk\". I told him we weren't and we hadn't drank at all before we got there, we had all just been at a work function. He told us the bartender saw us walking to the bathroom \"looking drunk\". He wouldn't let us finish our drinks that we had just been served and only made the 4 people with shots out of my friend group leave.

As a longtime bartender being served by a long term bartender, when I'm told \"wells are $2\" I trusted that Chad would be honest with us. Instead, he took us to the cleaners. If I could give no stars I would. I have been in San Marcos for over 10 years. About 6 years ago I was man-handled by a door guy for no reason. I did not return to Treff's for almost 4 years. Since then, I have gone back a handful of times in hopes that it was just \"one bad apple\", but now I see that the employees at Treff's are out for nothing more than money. Even the door guy tonight was short and smile-less. I have received nothing less than awful service at this bar and I will not be returning."

This was my second visit to Treff's because the first time i had been there i did not have a great experience. However, I am a big fan a second chances because who knows what might had been going on that night.   The drink prices are very reasonable. Whiskey Sours only $3.50 and then they have some killer drink specials during the week I believe on Sundays and Tuesdays they have -You - Call -  Its- for only $2!!   The upstairs bar area has a bunch of darts to play and even a pac-man arcade game to entertain with.   As for this little dive, I would return."

A toss between \"dive\" and \"college bar\", this establishment has cheap drink specials and the students know it! Beer selection is moderate, but for a college hangout there's a few local and craftbeers in the mix of domestic \"moneymaker\" beers.  The bar gets super busy, especially during \"$2 Tuesdays\" when everything is $2 and I mean EVERYTHING! With other various specials during the week, this is a must if you're a student looking to have a good time and stretch you're student loan/ scholarship/ college fund/ or emergency credit card that mom gave you just a little more..."

Their selection of beers was so/so, although I had heard that they had more than what they actually had.  The parking lot was awful. Construction going on and one way in and out. Only about 10-13 cars could park and you can forget it if you're driving a truck, as the guy driving a f250 found out after hitting the parked Mercedes.  Not a great place for a huge group of people, but not bad for a San Marcos bar. When visiting just be wary of the parking lot and crazy drivers."

Well, as usual, we squished into a parking spot in the front of the tavern, walked in and sat at an open bar stool. I ordered an Ace pear cider and started chatting with friends while the jukebox was going with a vast array of music choices! Thats the beauty of a jukebox and I love the diversity!  Okay so I decided to check in (via Yelp) and saw that they had an offer for $2 drinks which really excited me because it wasn't a Tuesday and I still could get some $2 drinks? HELL YEAH!  WELLLLLLL.... it was more like a HELLLLLL NO because the bartender didn't allow me to redeem my deal. He even said he texted the owner and that the owner had no idea what kind of deal I was talking about? Well, the offer is still open on my Yelp app and I plan to find the owner next time I'm at the bar and ask him about it because that offer didn't magically come to be!!!  Anyway, yes Treff's is a super chill, casual and cool bar but they lost some points with not accepting my Yelp offer (I mean that's what the offers are there for hellloooooo)!! Guess I'll stick to only going in on Tuesdays..."

The gin and tonic was more like a margarita and the Vietnamese coffee was really delicious. Smaller beer selection but there's something for every type of craft beer lover.   Hh chicken sandwich was HUGE. It kind of had a fried fish batter on the chicken. Nommm chicken karaage was pretty good and made a great shareable. Tomato and cucumber salad was so refreshing and had a bit of a spice kick. Got some type of bbq beef that was a bit pricey but tasted good."

                "description": "I've only been here twice but, have enjoyed it both times. I think I need to explore the menu more to figure out what my favorites are. I will say that with it being the new year, I have been trying to eat lighter and one thing I like about Loro is that they have plenty of healthy options on the menu.   I ordered the salmon rice bowl. The salmon was tender, flaked off easily and was seasoned well. It was quite tasty. It came with white rice, cilantro, red onion and a sauce. I thought the sauce/rest of the bowl could have been a bit more flavorful. I honestly think this was because I ordered salmon and salmon doesn't have a lot of fat like pork belly, etc. I took a bite of a friends bowl that had ordered pork belly and of course this was a large flavor difference. Not really any fault of Loros, I just think I will order a little extra sauce next time  if I choose salmon. It definitely checked off the health part though, ha!   We got an appetizer of pickled veggies, which were awesome! They had a variety of vegetables and they all packed quite a taste punch! Very good.   Also tried the Mango Sake Slushie and it was so good! My friend said this is what they're known for. It wasn't overly sweet and tasted natural but, still had alcohol in it! Definitely would get this again.   Giving 4 stars because I simply haven't tried enough of the menu yet, but look forward to trying more of what they have and enjoy knowing they have a variety of foods to pick from depending on my mood or calorie limit of the day!"

                "description": "TL;DR; Really quality food; cocktails are solid; service is nice with an interesting concept; cool vibes. Get the chicken karaage.  My husband and I came here for a date night on Saturday and had a great time. Seating was surprisingly easy (we got there around 6:30pm? We're seated at the bar within 5 minutes). We sat at the bar, which was nice because we didn't have to go up and order food/drinks (which is what you'd have to do if you are seated at a table). Bartender and service was nice and attentive, host was friendly but not annoying.   Originally, we came for drinks and try a few dishes to share, but everything sounded so go that we stuffed ourselves with too food to get to the drinks. I did try the Typhoon, which was pretty good. The frozen drinks looked good, but was too full of food to get one.  Would DEFINITELY come back for the food. We both got rice bowls (husband got the chopped smoked brisket and I got the char siew pork belly), the corn fritters, and chicken karaage. DO NOT SLEEP ON THE KARAAGE. So delicious--the sauce they drizzle on top is *chef's kiss*, the jalapeño aioli was a perfect pair, and it was super tender, juicy, and crisp all at the same time.  Corn fritters tasted great, only critique is that the sweet corn was SUPER sticky/gummy (stick to your teeth in every aspect)."

These are all the things I would associate Loro with. Did you know that Loro is a fusion from the famous bbq of Austin TX - Franklin  and amazing sushi chef from Uchi? This birth child mix of Asian fusion bbq is not to miss or else you'll regret it.  Let's begin with how satisfy I was with the fantastic happy hour price. Don't forget to catch it on weekdays 2 pm to 5 pm. The drinks are to die for and that fried chicken was so crispy and delicious , I'll be content with just eating it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   Definitely a must go to for one of the best happy hour deals in town !"

Picture THAT dish that knocks you off your feet in a big meal....now imagine every dish you have is THAT good. I'd haul it back to Austin just for the bavette!!  Must try's when you come: - crispy potatoes: every potato was crispy on the outside yet flavorful and soft on the inside. I could drink the yuzu aioli  - crunchy sweet corn fritters: the best corn fritters I've ever had??? Again the sriracha aioli was PERFECT to pair with it (overall Loro had mad sauce game) - chicken karaage: perfectly fried and plenty of juicy, slightly mala meat. Def need to get if you like chili oil  - smoked beef brisket: it's so tender, it's difficult to pick up and literally melts in your mouth  - char siew pork belly: the sauce is hoisin with a twist, and it's so savory and cuts the fatty pork belly in the best way - smoked prime bavette: oh my god? How have I never had bavette before this?? This was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. It was the most perfect medium rare and literally so tender I couldn't comprehend  They also hit it out of the park with their drinks - the mango sake and Vietnamese coffee slushees were AMAZING (the viet coffee will WAKE you up). Overall an amazing spot to grab a bite with friends or for a date night. Heard they're opening up in Houston and you bet I'll be first in line to check it out!"

My wife and I usually go for their happy hour and the Yuzu Spritz is our favorite. The food is really delicious too but wish there were some vegetarian food options in their happy hour menu.  This has definitely become our go to Friday happy hour spot.  Couple of recommendations - 1. Parking can get full so you may have to lurk around a little  2. Food and drinks ordering is a little fast food style where yo I go inside the restaurant to order and then the servers will come find you   Overall, a must visit !!"

I was confused when I entered because I didn't know if I needed to check in, but it's pretty much self seating and you order your food and drinks at the bar.   Since I was only here to grab a quick weekday lunch bite, I ordered the Chicken Karaage and the Smoke Prime Bavette. They were both so good! The chicken karaage was well battered and just fried perfectly, on top of that, the chicken was topped with their version of a sweet chili sauce and some cilantro and Thai basil. The smoked prime Bavette was delicious! The steak was obviously the tasty star of the dish, but I also that they did a really good job with their coconut rice. The sides, like watermelon radish and red onion. help cut the richness of the rice and the smoked prime. Lastly, my only drawback was the sauce that came with it as it was a little too sour for my tastes, so to anyone who is sensitive to sour, take it easy with your pour!  Overall, I would definitely come back with friends to try their drinks and enjoy this delicious food again."

Loro is the brainchild of Aaron Franklin and Tyson Cole and it does not disappoint. They call themselves an Asian smokehouse. The menu brings the best of both worlds to all those who dine there.   Happy Hour is from 2-5. They sell $4 Ty Ku Sake plus Stemmari wines on tap (Pinot Grigio, Rosé, and Pinot Noir). I love the Rosé. They have a cheeseburger that has shredded brisket with red onion jam on top! It is only available during HH or until they run out.  Pro-tip. Order it to go and enjoy it the next day.   Other favorites include the chicken Karage, corn fritters, beef tostadas, crispy potatoes, pickled vegetables, pork belly, and the smoked Prime bavette. The brisket is delicious, but only available after 4 pm. Everything comes with an Asian flair (sriracha aioli with the corn fritters, chili aioli and Thai herbs with the Karage, miso mustard and yuzu aioli with the potatoes, hoisin sauce with the pork belly, and shishito salsa verde with the bavette).  They have a nice large outdoor patio with a combination of picnic tables and smaller tables with chairs. They also have ample indoor seating. You order at the bar and they bring the food to your table. They also offer curbside service - which was my go-to option during the lockdown.  The parking gets full quickly, but there are spaces just south of them in the lot behind the building next door."

Service is different than expected but we appreciated how it worked out. You order drinks and food at the bar. They give you a pager tracker to put on your table. Runners bring out the food. They have a large outdoor seating area and a large dining room. Great collaboration of BBQ and Asian  flavors. Most are weird  combinations but what else would you expect in Austin? Solid 5"

                "description": "The atmosphere of the restaurant was super casual. You seat yourself and then order food at the bar. The outdoor dining patio area had spacious picnic tables with some sections covered with tent coverings.  Smoked Prime Bavette ($18.75): The medium-rare steak was tender and sliced thinly. There were some rich flavors from the shishito salsa verde and the natural smoke.  Loro Cheeseburger ($12):  When I bit into the thick beef patty, I knew right away how high quality it was. The burger had a southern flare with the slight barbecue sweetness from the brisket layer.  The red-onion brisket jam added some more  dimension.  Crunchy Corn Fritters ($7.75): An appetizer with an Incredibly crispy outer battered shell and soft sweet corn tidbits inside. The sriracha aioli dipping sauce cut through the heaviness from the fried batter."

                "description": "I'm sorry, but I will never get the hype with this place. I've been here three times, and every time I wonder why it is that people recommend Loro. Fusion Asian food is always a huge hit or miss, and Loro definitely misses out every single time.   My friend and I ordered their chicken karaage, cold noodles, and corn fritters. All of the dishes were incredibly mediocre and left us wanting more out of the dish. The corn fritters were only edible with the sauce that they give, the cold noodles were not worth the price tag attached, and the chicken karaage was a mess. The only redeeming items we ordered were their gin and tonic and mint mojito. Those were absolutely delicious.   For some reason, their workers always seem like they don't want to be working there and I almost feel bad for going up to them to order my food. I've never come across a kind server at Loro."

                "description": "Came to Loro for a friend's birthday, and as per usual, was met with a great experience. We stopped by Friday evening around 7:30pm and waited a little over an hour for a table, but the time flew by with great company and the ambience. The waiting area was equipped with an outside bar, elevating the atmosphere and allowing us to get some drinks in while we waited.  In terms of food, we ordered the crispy potatoes, chicken karaage, smoked brisket, and the malaysian chicken bo ssam (not pictured, sorry ate too fast). The potatoes were delectably crispy and were paired perfectly with the creamy aioli sauce. Needless to say, they were destroyed within minutes.   Moving on, if there's one thing you'd have to get at Loro, it would definitely be the chicken karaage. One thing about Loro is that every single ingredient and flavor you can tell is thought out and placed for a reason. Not only do the flavors of the ginger and cilantro complement the sweet glaze of the chicken wonderfully, it also add layers of flavor that bombard your taste buds in the best way.   I would also highly recommend the malaysian chicken bo ssam which was unfortunately demolished before I could get a picture. It came with lettuce wraps, pickles, pickled radish and chicken. The chicken was tender and topped with an authentic Malaysian sauce that was smoky and had curry-esque flavors. I really enjoyed how light/clean this entree was, whilst still providing a great variety of volume and flavors.   Finally, we also ordered the smoked brisket. I feel like the only thing needed to be said is that you can tell Franklin's was involved in this establishment.   To sum things up, Loro continues to be one of my go-to spots here in Austin. I always walk away feeling beyond satisfied in terms of quantity, and happy knowing the quality is similarly as great.   5 stars."

Place your order at the bar, get a number and they bring it out to your table. Asian fusion. Upscale casual atmosphere. Turned into more of a bar atmosphere as time went on - lots of people standing around between tables. Extremely fast service. Friendly staff.  We tried a bunch of different dishes, which combined to be enough for five people. I counted nine dishes and enjoyed every single one of them! Also had a Vietnamese coffee slush, which is alcoholic, to end it. Unique and refreshing!"

The chilaquiles ($11) are seriously amazing. Pork, salsa verde, tortilla chips, feta, sour cream, eggs, onions, arugula, radishes. Yum. I finished every bite on my plate and craved more hours later once my appetite returned. This is the best thing by far on the menu.   If you are looking for an appetizer (aka their snacks) the pimento cheese dip is wonderful. One of the best ones I have ever tasted. Also Texans LOVE pimento cheese.   During brunch they have $5 mimosas, $5 frose, and $5 bloody Mary's. Yum.   They occasionally host drag brunch, which I have also attended with my girlfriends. We booked a table a month in advance and had a wonderful experience. Super fun for a girls \"day\" out/birthday party/etc."

                "description": "Everything except the Froze was LEGIT.  Baby was paying today, so I ordered two entrees: the Kale Caesar salad was fresh and delicious. It was tart, well-dressed, great texture.  Avocado toast was as delicious. Toast was a tad crispy for my taste, but I appreciate the whole wheat offering and importantly, my over-medium egg was cooked perfectly. My wife's tomato bisque was spot-on, and her grilled cheese was golden brown and ooey-gooey.  Service was great, food came out quick and hot, and the atmosphere was adorable and spacious.  The froze would've been better marketed as a novelty slush than a drink- it was icy but dry- could've been served with a spoon. We'll return again to try more of the awesome options in the extensive menu."

The outside patio, and pink lit up letters caught our attention. We noticed it was pretty packed because they were having a Bachelor watch party lol.   When we walked up to the window, my eyes lit up looking at their desert display  but I knew I had to eat dinner first. We both ordered burgers, but mine were sliders.   I will say that the meat was cooked to the perfect medium well temperature on a lightly toasted buttered bun. Great flavor! I had it with a side of chips, and washed it down a delicious froźe.   The vibe was super chill, and it's a great patio to hang out at on a good weather day."

So excellent, beautiful texture and taste. Honestly a bit mind blowing  2. The Buffalo chicken is quite good, but perhaps should have eaten it faster because the bread got a bit soggy  3. The fried chicken slider was average -- a bit too dry and flavorless -- compared to the others.  Enjoyed my friends peach vodka drink, had a weird maitai wouldn't recommend.   The strawberry cake was just fine"

                "description": "My friends and I came here for our final brunch of bachelorette weekend. This place is really well known spot that I've been hearing about for years as a San Antonio native.  On weekends they usually don't take reservations, but bc we wanted to reserve for a bachelorette, they let us reserve in advance for $18 a person. The price includes popcorn, Jell-O shots, and a dessert as well.  Popcorn was a bit stale, and for the dessert they had bite sized rice krispy treats. I was expecting actual dessert or the option to choose a dessert, but that wasn't the case. They ran pretty short on the jello shots so they offered to cover a drink/coffee for the entire party. I didn't try the dessert or the jello shots so can't really review that, but I did get a latte and that was pretty basic. I liked that they had alternative milks to choose from!   For the actual eating portion, I decided on the French toast platter. It's supposed to come with berries on top and choice of eggs and protein/avo (I chose poached w/ avocado).   The platter was good, especially for the price ($12 for a well known brunch spot!). Instead of adding berries to it, they added peaches. Still good but it would be nice to be notified of the change. My Eggs and avocado looked a bit sad and small, which was unfortunate. I'm guessing they just skimp out on poached eggs because my friends had theirs scrambled and it filled up the plate. Food overall was pretty good tho aside from the minor drawbacks!   This was definitely a learning experience for me. I would love to come back again, but next time would avoid making a party reservation (to avoid an extra $18 fee) and get my eggs made differently!"

I ordered an \"apple of my pie\" drink, one of their seasonal fall cocktails. It took a long time to get my drink, but it was worth the wait. It was light and you can barely taste the alcohol.   As far as the food, everyone in my party of 6 wasn't impressed. I ordered the fried chicken sliders and they were bland. Two of my friends ordered the turkey Rueben and said it had too much dressing. Another friend ordered pimento cheese dip and it came with saltine crackers; it tasted fine with saltines but it would've been better with tortilla chips. The others ordered salads and wings and they said they were fine.   If you're looking for a nice casual drinking spot, Irene's is your place. They have a nice patio area with picnic tables and our server was really nice and attentive."

They have a small parking lot right next door that you can text to pay- super easy but pricy.   Walking in, we went straight to the host and was seated immediately- they have indoor and outdoor dining. We chose to sit indoor because it was so hot today!  Our server greeted us quickly and we decided to order our drinks \"to-go\" but not really to go because of the cute capri-sun/koolaid pouch style drinks.  The drinks were great- nice and strong. I got buzzed off of one!!!   We decided to order light since we were going to eat somewhere else after.  The food: 1) Al Pastor Tacos: meat and tortilla were really dry. However the pineapple salsa was nice and refreshing. 2) Kimchi beef sliders: ordered as medium,  but came out as well done. But the flavors were great, I enjoyed it!!  Service was average. Checkout was quick. Would come back to try other food items."

The songs they played (all rap music, which I don't typically have a problem with, but not these particular choices and not first thing to start my day at lunch in a restaurant) had a lot of cursing - on one particular song that was the whole chorus, so it was impossible to ignore.  Since we stopped in town for Mom's 75th birthday weekend on our way up to Lake Travis, it wasn't something we wanted to hear while we are eating, so we finished pretty quickly and left rather than having the leisurely lunch I'd planned.  ¡No Bueno!

It was pretty busy as we went during prime brunch hours on a Saturday. We had the option of either putting our name down on a list and waiting for about an hour for a table or ordering through an outside checkout line and getting a table in the outside seating area (first come first serve). We chose the latter and it was pretty easy to get a table outside and the outside checkout line was pretty seamless!

Came at 11am on a Sunday morning with 5 others and was seated immediately. Their patio area is large and well spaced out with adequate ventilation. Pretty cute decor and vibes.  Now, onto the food. It wasn't bad by any means, but was below expectations. My order (baked eggs) was probably the best thing we had, and the mixture of grits, kimchi, and eggs was decently filling with a lot of different flavors (not for everyone imo). The bread it came with was really good! On the other hand, my friends got the brunch grilled cheese and chilaquiles, and both were small portions and looked like you could make them (better?) at home. Flavors and seasoning for the chilaquiles were not good according to my friend (I trust his judgments)."

                "description": "This place was great! Drove up from SA last weekend. My husband arrived early and sat at the bar from the minute it opened. When I arrived, he was already in pretty deep. He offered to order some food for me, but I doubted he would have ordered what I would've wanted considering his state.  Upon arrival there was a massive wait list already going. I sat next to my hub at the bar and ordered a pozole, confusing the bartender because she thought I was going to order a drink. She was super nice and the pozole was delicious. I was surprised at how filling it was. I'm used to crushing a huge vat of pozole, and here's this petite cast iron pot of it.   Our friends arrived an hour later. I was determined to have a slice or strawberry cake and since I'm so health conscious...some vegetables christened with slabs of friend chicken.  The cake came first. It was good. Fresh strawberries dotted the cake throughout. Jam separated each layer. The cream cheese frosting was sweet, but played nicely with the tartness of the berry and the cheese.  The salad was good, with butternut squash and apples. The fried chicken was so moist. It think it was chicken breast..but the moistest chicken breast I've ever had.  Se stayed seemingly til the end of service. The service was wonderful throughout. What a nice Sunday in Austin."

                "description": "I won't be going back.  There was almost no customers when we went. Despite saying to seat yourself, no one came to take our order.  I went to the bar twice in twenty minutes to ask if I should order there or if a server was coming and was told a server would be sent.  I received no such server.  This was exemplary of their frequent inattentive and disinterested service towards customers.  Also, the food options are honestly quite limited in what you can get. The drinks are usually watered down and overpriced, based off of prior experiences here.  I couldn't find anything on the menu that seemed appealing enough to order.  I'll be going to other places nearby from now on."

                "description": "I arrived in Austin, TX on 10/18/18 with no plans until the following day and thought a tour was a good idea. However all the traditional tours appeared to be booked. I stumbled upon the Austin Brewery Tours' website while searching on Yelp for ideas.   I had an awesome time exploring Austin's growing beer scene. I also had a great time meeting and making friends the other tourists on our tour.   I enjoyed all of the 3 breweries but the behind the scene tour at Independence Brewing Co. made it my favorite.   The price is very fair when you consider it includes your tastings and tips for your severs.   In a nutshell, a good alternative tour for those interested in the Austin craft beer scene."

No one In our group lived in Austin so it was good to get some info about the city and neighborhoods. The 3 breweries we stopped at were all unique from each other in size, atmosphere, and beers. At each stop you choose two beers to try which is great. We've been on other tours where you do not pick. We were given about an hour at each stop which was ample time. I would highly recommend this tour company!"

                "description": "Apparently it's become a tradition that we do a brewery tour when we travel. One of the breweries I was told I MUST visit, while in Austin, was Jester King. Searched online for brewery tours that included this and finally decided on Austin Brewery Tours.  Almost daily tours, online booking was so easy, and we got a reminder, a couple of days earlier to our tour, via email.  Tour starts at noon.  Meetup time was 11:30am. At around 11:25am the van was there.  Out comes Shane, owner and tour guide. He immediately introduced himself, thanked us for being on time and proceeded to ask us our names and where we were from. Once the other people taking the tour arrived, we were all introduced and in the van we went.  During the time we were driving, he would ask us questions to get to know us better, and see the style of beers we liked. He also gave us an intro of each of the breweries we would visit. He made the time driving pass by fast and welcomed all questions we could have.  At each of the breweries, he explained the process and what we had included in the price of the tour. At Jester King, they even had a special release and he bought a sample of each (which was not included in the price but he gifted us with it) making sure we had the complete experience.    You can tell he enjoys doing these tours and meeting the people.   He even took us to Revolution - which was in front of one of the breweries we visited - to try locally made flavored gin.   So greateful he allowed us to do this quick stop - this was delicious, and gave me the opportunity to talk more with one of the ladies on the tour, exchanging ideas on recipes with the gin we had just tried.    Shane is grate at incorporating everyone in the tour and conversations.  He allows you plenty of time to enjoy each brewery and every beer you choose.   He is now friends with the staff at each of these breweries, which works on the advantage of everyone in the tour since we got excellent/ friendly service at each stop.  Best part of this all, is you meet new people, get to enjoy all the beer you can drink, and don't have to drive. Great way to spend a day in Austin.  If looking for a beer tour, look no further, this is it!"

                "description": "October 2018. 5 out of 5. We decided to take a brewery tour while we visited Austin. This ended up being a great decision. The tour is structured well. We did three stops which gave us a good opportunity to try three different breweries without having to worry about driving, parking, or any of the attendant Logistics. The tour covers all expenses including tips which is a nice touch. You can tell that the tour is well organized and that the breweries appreciate the business. That means you end up getting much better service at all of the breweries than you sometimes get with such packages. The tour guide also is able to make excellent suggestions so if you don't have a lot of experience with craft beer this is a great way to learn. If you have any interest in a brewery tour while in Austin I highly recommend this tour."

They made it so easy to have a fun day planned. Our tour guide, James, was the best! Great driver, super cool guy, and made sure we had the best experience possible at each brewery. He made the day so fun, stress-free, and kept us all on track.  We stopped at a mix of well known and off the beaten path breweries. If you're visiting from out of town, this is one of the best tours to see the heart of Austin craft brewing. I can't recommend them highly enough."

Of all the awesome people we met and food we ate, our guide Shane as well as the guys at the Lotus Joint food truck were freakin awesome!  SXSW had Austin jammed with a lot to do but Shane made sure we got to see Austin and its beer community like the locals do. He was insanely knowledgeable not just about beer but also about Texas. When you've solo traveled the world like he has, you gain a perspective that makes you far more relatable too which made him an all around cool guy to hangout with.  Most important.. The beers were phenomenal! (Try the goat tacos at Lotus also!)  In town for a day, a week, or a life time - Hands down recommend this for anyone in Austin!"

I was so pleased with the entire tour: Shane is an amazing host who took us around, shared lots of information about the area, along with the breweries. He was very friendly and ensured we had a good time. Even though it was about 1000 degrees outside, he kept the van cool and ensured we were cared for.  We had opportunities to not only sample excellent beers, but also visit several food trucks in the area. His rapport with the brewery owners gave us extra attention and really made us feel special.  I would absolutely do this tour again!  Highly recommended."

His knowledge of beer in general along with his totally chill attitude and attention to every little detail ( making sure we had water along with our tastings to matching our individual tastes in selecting what we should explore ) was over the top customer experience!!!

Brooke was a wonderful tour guide, and she made good beer recommendations (especially considering that I'm not much of a beer drinker).   We did the Hill Country Tour and visited Jester King, Last Stand, and Skull Mechanix. Each tour had a tasting option (one where we all tasted beers as a group and the others where we each got to pick our own beers to try). After selecting beer to taste, we got to explore each brewery on our own before moving onto the next location. We had enough time to eat (plan on eating at Jester King. The food is awesome and we spent the most time there) and to drink at every place, while still getting to individually wander and see all that these breweries had to offer. We also got to take the Jester King tour, which is really cool.   I'd highly recommend an afternoon with Austin Brewery Tours!! Thank you Brooke for a great day!"

Tremendous job moving us from location to location while never making us feel rushed, so glad it wasn't on me to wrangle the guys when it was time to go :). Also, your beer recommendations were spot on! Same with your suggestions for things to do for the rest of the weekend.   I have been on similar tours in other cities and Austin Brewery Tours is the gold standard now.

                "description": "LADIES, if you want to feel uncomfortable, if you want to be harassed, assaulted and invalidated this is the place to go! The manager Tyler is incompetent and does not care about the well being of his customers.   Never going back to this bar again and I suggest you don't either.   Been coming to this bar for years with no issues, ever and have spent SO much money here (I live on Rainey). The staff have always been great until...  Tonight I had a group of young girls create a conflict with my group of friends for no reason. They swarmed our table and harassed us - pulled my friends hair, STOLE MY FRIENDS PHONE and, on top of that, a man that was part of this group forcefully grabbed my arms. The bouncers did nothing to get our phone returned nor remove a girl who pulled my friends hair and was cursing me out and flipping me off. They made me sound crazy when I asked for help. My voice did not matter. I asked to see the cameras and conveniently there are no cameras located in the front (which is absurd given that this is where all the tables and chairs are). It is one thing that these mean girls tried to start conflict with me and my friends for no reason, but this man grabbed my wrists so hard that I could not move and I had to front kick him in the stomach to get away. This is not okay under any circumstance and the fact that the bouncer and manager turned a blind eye is disgusting.  I wish there were cameras because I would press charges. This is so incredibly degrading as a woman and I am still shook that appropriate action was not taken."

When we walked in, everything felt perfect so we booked it on the spot.    We had some random requests like being able to adjust the music volume, film in the space, have dedicated security, and have a custom drink and glass (photo attached).  Idle Hands was able to accommodate everything (thanks Matt!).  During the event, Gabriel from Idle Hands helped ensure all of our guests were well-attended to.  Everything went super smooth, if you're considering a private event, you're in good hands with Idle Hands :)"

                "description": "Nice joint on Rainey which punches above its weight in terms of drinks and food. Rainey in general is a bit of a mixed bag but this place was surprisingly good.   They have a Cuban food focus and use an interesting ticket system with every drink you get that you can redeem for food (probably to ensure enough food sales to stay open during Covid). I had about 4 Painkillers, a properly dangerous pineapple/coconut/orange and rum drink that was delicious. Summery is the best way to describe a lot of their cocktails.   Had some of the best fried plantain chips I've ever had with guacamole and ceviche. My only complaint was I wish they had comfier seating for hanging out and it ended up shortening our time we spent there (lots of high chairs and hard back seats). They dont have a decent back deck like a lot of Rainey places do so the seating was mainly up front where speakers were blasting, including the neighboring businesses music. So it ended up being a little chaotic.   Either way its a nice spot. Service, drinks and food were great so I think we'll drop by again."

                "description": "Love the drinks, menu and staff. Very friendly service and with the bar being mostly outside, a safe space to enjoy a cocktail or a bite to eat. And as a bonus they have live music almost every night!!    My faves: The Painkiller - it goes down way too easy.  The Lover Boy - a killer chorizo-infused burger that will make your mouth water.   Lots of great staff and be sure to save room for the dessert! Tyler is an amazing baker who makes all the desserts for this place. The cheesecake was incredible!!   A few words about Covid restrictions - I've seen most of the bars on Rainey - almost none of them are following the protocols. I feel like this place is the exception. No lines or large groups gathering on top of each other inside. Outside seating spaced well. Staff all have on masks. That plus the food, drinks and service mean I'll be back many more times. The menu evolves some too, always like a place willing to add and try new things while keeping some of the faves on the menu.  Thank you Idle Hands - finally something good out of 2020!"

Read all these reviews raving about it and thought it'd be better. I guess y'all were smashed from the fancy cocktails lol. It wasn't bad, just didn't really standout and for $12 for a burger and fries, I think there's better options in town. My fault for expecting culinary excellence from what I assume is a bar kitchen."

                "description": "This is a generous two star offering. Love the location, the great local talent playing on the porch and our drinks were very tasty.   Big however...  The food was pitiful. The black bean burger was an oversized sopping, crumbly mess with zero flavor and the fries were cold and uneventful. The ranch may as well been runny, salty mayo. My lady pal got the plantain chips with guacamole. They gave us tortilla chips with guacamole. My guy friend went in to ask for the plantain chips that they were supposed to come with. He took a photo with his phone of the chips and dip to show the bartender and he practically laughed in my buddies face and mocked his photo taking as a means to justify his request (he's in production and art, okay? Let the guy make art and an example of your crappy food).   The man brought us the plantain chips out a few moments later to go with the guacamole. Which was the worst guacamole I've had. Del Taco makes better guacamole. Salt? Lime? Heat? Maybe just try to make it flavorful...  Oh and the quinoa bowl-- that one veggie thing. What the heck even was that? It had no sauce; oil or spices to bind together what was basically a sad bowl of vegetables and bitter arugula.   Way off the mark with the food, guys. Good thing the music was kickin' and the mezcal ritas were nice n' zesty.   Get drinks and an earful or music and skip the food. All 3 of our dishes were very weak."

My roommate and I came from SF, CA, and on our second night we randomly stopped here because of the live music - who actually was a contestant on the voice!! WOW!!!! We ordered \"That One Healthy Thing\" and some very specific drinks made by Brennan. He is an amazing bartender! I hope if the owner sees this, he/she gives him a fat raise.

Someone at our table spilled a cocktail and they replaced it quickly and for free!  One cool thing about this bar is that they give you tickets every time you order a drink, and tickets add up to be free food items! Their fries and chips/queso were good.

                "description": "I understand having hiccups in a new establishment, but I was really disappointed in some of the things they had more control over. - COVID protocols are unfortunately lacking. To order, you're required to download an app. Nobody at our table was able to access to menu from the app, and the staff seemed super unfamiliar with it, too. A couple of employees looked at the app on our phone for a couple seconds before they gave up and took our orders normally, negating \"contact-free\" ordering. - Our waitress routinely came within 6 inches of us, which is basically face-to-face when youre sitting at a high top. She would pull her mask down to speak and came over at least once with her mask on her chin. - The drinks were great!  - The live music was a nice touch and was a mental break from the whole looming pandemic thing. People were singing along to the acoustic guitar player and having fun.  - Due to COVID, each drink is required to also come with plantain chips, which was not communicated with us. We received our check and had 5 orders of plantain chips tracked on and were super confused. I understand the requirement, but a surprise $22 charge isn't cool. Additionally, they apparently ran out of chips, so we paid for 5 chips we never received.  - When we arrived, we explained that our friends were inside already at a table waiting for us. The ID taker had us wait outside for 5 minutes before allowing us in to meet them. He gave no explanation and I'm still not sure what we were waiting for."

The outdoor gravel patio is like sitting in someone's backyard under huge oak trees. They have simple lanterns strung from the tree branches and umbrellas all around. I loved the ambiance.   We ordered the tasting menu and the wine flight. The wine pairings were one of the best I've ever had. I'm not a fan of white wine but the owner picked the best French wines that paired perfectly with each course.   The first course was a hamachi crudo- perfectly light with subtle flavor.  Second course was a green bean salad- this was my favorite of the night. The beans were lightly pickled then charred and served on a yogurt queso fresco sauce- HEAVENLY. I make a mean green bean but theirs was the best I've ever had.  Third course was shrimp and vegetables. This was my least favorite, and it was still amazing.  Fourth course was the char siu and watermelon. Perfectly cooked and the balance of flavors was delicious. I was so full at this point but I still soldiered on.  Last course was ice cream with almond crumble. I'm not a fan of ice cream but this was really good.  Our server Quentin made our experience an unforgettable one. We'll be back for sure."

FOOD: Delicious and thoughtful menu. We did the tasting menu for a birthday, and it took about 2 hours (we're quick eaters, too). They asked very intentionally at the beginning if we had any allergies and dietary restrictions, which was really thoughtful. Slight side note that the plates and serving ware was quite cute, which is just an ancillary sort of plus.  SERVERS: Speedy and really quite nice. They had recommendations, provided bug spray, were knowledgeable about the beverages. No complaints.  AMBIENCE: Currently (Oct 2021) only outdoor seating. It was well-lit and covered overhead. Quite good dinner date spot.   BATHROOMS: Gender neutral bathrooms indoors. It's may be a 50-ft walk to the bathrooms? Two single-person bathrooms. Clean, stocked. No complaints.  PARKING: A few (Like 10ish?) parking spots in a lot, otherwise I think it's street parking."

We had a 5 course meal and only one wasn't to my liking. The char shui was moist and flavored well. I was a little skeptical at first glance but it turned out delicious.   My only gripe was that dinner took 2.5 hours. It cut into our other plans that we had that night. So, if you have a big party, plan accordingly.   PS - Because it's near a creek, please careful of water bugs... As I was cutting the char shui, one crawled across my lap napkin. Imagine a screaming woman frantically waving her knife around as her first initial reaction. Yep, that was me. *Raise hand* I almost stabbed my friend while trying to get it off me."

Go for the HH for 1/2 bottle robes and great mixed drinks the watermelon chiller was pretty and refreshing.  We got the cab franc bottle and was light and paired well with our meals. - HH bread with pimiento was interesting  -HH shrimp boil was different with fresh shrimp and okra and corn and something crunchy on top  - lamb vindaloo was not spicy but tasty and oddly accompanied very well with the sliced watermelon  - mp bass with Goan crab curry was delightful and complex flavors to create a light main entree  Service was so friendly and just stellar and we enjoyed our culinary experience for 2 hours on a Thursday night and in no way felt rushed  Romantic and fun place to be.  Highly recommended!"

The opening items (an Amuse bouche of falafel-like crisps with a lovely sauce and a sashimi with a tangy sauce) were so good. Blew us away.   Personally, the third item, gnocchi, was not my favorite. It is made from corn flour, not potato, which is slightly off putting. My friend described it as enchilada in bite form. I liked the spinach.   The steak was amazing. I liked the texture and the taste. It had a lovely chimichurri like sauce with leeks. The cucumber salad bopped too.   Finally, the dessert -- light and pleasing. Highly recommend trying the tasting menu if you come."

Each dish was full of pleasantly surprising flavors and they were all beautifully presented. The tasting menu also left us happily full without being overstuffed.   To go with our meal, we chose a bottle of wine from their ample selection. They also offer a few cocktails, beers, and some wine by the glass, but getting a bottle seems to be the way to go.    Our server, Dustin, was fantastic. He was very willing to hear any and all dietary restrictions or quirks, and was happy to work with the the couple that I mentioned. He was clearly passionate about everything on the menu and his excitement for what we chose showed. He even gave us great tips on places to check out in Austin later that night.   Dining at Lenoir was a highlight during the few days we spent in Austin, the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was wonderful."

                "description": "Noticed they were doing their Chef's Tasting menu (five courses) for only $29 during January so booked a table the last weekend of the special.  The wine patio was a perfect happy hour spot pre-COVID, and so it's no shock that with a few finishing touches like a tent and heaters, it would make for a wonderful dinner experience, too.  Anthony was our server and he was so on top of it all night long. In addition to taking care of the dietary restrictions of some of the group, he also was very generous with the wine pours!  I can thankfully eat everything, but just want to give a hats off to the kitchen for accommodating the two gluten-free diners. They even made a special dessert for a friend that is allergic to eggs!  The menu was pretty stacked with seafood options which made it light but satisfying. I am not a huge oyster fan, but Sweet Home Alabama were theirs tasty! The tuna pappardelle was interesting...someone's hot take was that it reminded them of a more sophisticated tuna casserole. Impressive there was no dairy in the dish but it had a creamy, cheesy texture. My favorite was the seafood stew-esque dish with the delightful bread for dipping.   The $40 wine pairing was a steal! Not only were the pours accompanying each dish full (not a sissy tasting pour), but Anthony would just magically top off our glasses like a vino ninja, so I felt as if I had prob consumed an entire bottle by the end. And, definitely not mad at that!  While the half off special may not be a thing any longer, I still recommend visiting Lenoir for a nice dinner out, with all the precautions in place/being observed."

                "description": "Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 Food: 3.5  Came for the January chef's tasting menu ($29) outside. Been wanting to try this place for some time so there were definitely some expectations after having seen and heard about it. Overall it was a good experience, but the food was not as great as expected.   Started with an oyster on the half shell - how can you go wrong with that? They did it perfectly.   Next up was a winter salad, which had beets, roasted butternut squash, some tomatoes, and beer infused peanuts; the peanuts were delicious, and the squash was nice; I didn't care too much for the texture but the flavor overall was decent and fresh.   A cooked \"salad\" was next with roasted broccoli, mushrooms, walnuts, and grapefruit, with melted taleggio cheese on the bottom. Interesting mix of flavors and textures, saltiness of the cheese and bitterness of the grapefruit were different, but the broccoli were very large pieces. Nice to try but probably not something I'd eat often.   The main dish was a baked fish with shrimp, arugula, and sliced radish in a tomato soup. TBH it was kind of underwhelming for the main dish and a bit too bitter and salty for my taste. The shrimp and fish were nicely cooked but not my favorite on flavor.   For dessert was a coconut cake, and a rice pudding. I didn't try the cake, and I know that rice pudding should be al dente, but this was a bit undercooked. It was nice of them to whip it up since I couldn't have the cake due to gluten, but it just wasn't that great unfortunately."

                "description": "This is a nice place with date vibes. The food was great , me and my partner decided to do chefs menu, pescatarian version. Started with hush puppies, strawberry aguachile, avocado tostada, large crab stuffed fish and citron cake.   One thing I'm confused about still is if we got one order of each or was it two servings as everything came in 1 plate for 2 people to share.   We additionally had Pullman bread and peach, strawberry cocktails. Everything was great.   Advice: ask if you opt for chef menu do you get 1 or 2 serving of the item when 2 people are eating. I believe we got only 1 per item to share in which case you are better off ordering from menu yourself rather than chefs choice."

I realize they can't remove patrons! But, we didn't have to wait that long and they seated us in a little area while we waited and gave us a pitcher of water (and two glasses!).  We opted for the the chef's menu and wine pairing. We really, really enjoyed it. the ambiance was specular, outside under the Live Oak trees and lanterns. The servers were excellent. We will be back to try other items on the menu. Honestly, we felt like we were on vacation."

                "description": "Partner and I went to Lenoir for a date night. It's been a long time since I've dined here and didn't realize they had this nice spacious beer garden! They are offering 50% off their chef's tasting which is a 5 course tasting. They serve things family style and had an upgrade to a fish dish for an additional $25. Overall the dishes were good, though the beginning dishes were a little spicy and acidic. I very much enjoyed the whole fish that they mostly deboned. Dessert was a flan and churro-esque cookie that was a light way to end the meal.   During COVID it felt safe dining as it was outside and it was well spaced. They do have a covered area which unfortunately we didn't get to sit under. There was some light rain during the meal which they provided umbrellas for, but awkwardly we had to hold it up ourselves. Most tables had an umbrella but ours didn't."

Lots of shade and misting fans to keep down the heat and umbrellas also. Lights strung up to really make the ambiance perfect for dining.  The service was top notch. Thank you Clinton for anticipating our every need and knowing and recommending perfect wine pairings also. You and your team are on top of everything and it's greatly appreciated, especially because you have a friendly and respectful attitude. No snobs here.  Finally, the food was outstanding!!!! Way to go chef. Farm fresh and full of flavor in every bites. Our party of 4 tried 3 small, 3 large plates and 2 desserts and there wasn't a morsel left of any of them. So much flavor!!!  The wines were also outstanding. All natural and bursting with flavor that paired perfectly with every dish.  We will definitely be back and with friends!!"

The outdoor patio seating is spacious and comfortable, with fire pits at the ready should the temperature drop. The food - just outstanding!! The chef's tasting with wine pairing runs at $40 a person, a value I dare you to best. Service hit on all marks. Parking is a bit limited. I can't wait to come back."

The food was amazing, service was excellent, and the atmosphere is so classy and Austin-y! My night started with the server asking about our drink choice (obviously) but I had never tried any of the wines on their list and requested a recommendation. She was so patient and kind when choosing our wines and allowed us to sample them before committing.   Here is my order (Chef's choice 5 course meal): - Nebbiolo - Choice of wine for the night. It was light, earthy, and perfectly paired with most of my dishes throughout the evening! - Amuse-Bouche - A delightfully light and airy fish with herbs and greens. Honestly, I wish I knew what exactly this was but due to the volume of the place and the masks, I could not always hear my waiter! - Roasted Butternut Squash and Beets - This salad was DELISH and made me feel so healthy to start off the meal! Typically I don't like peanuts on my dishes but these were so seamlessly worked into the meal that I didn't even notice! - Tuna casserole - Never would I ever have ordered this of my own volition but lets just say, trust this chef!! It was incredibly fresh pasta that was light and packed a flavor punch. Not your grandma's tuna casserole! - Braise lamb shank with chickpea stew - OH MY GOSH! This was absolutely delicious. The meat just fell off the bone and did not taste game-y at all! 10/10 recommend - Coffee Flan - Perfect ending to the perfect night.  TLDR; Find Lenior and give it a try! Take a date, a friend, or impress your parents with your swanky new find!"

                "description": "This January, I discovered the Wine Patio at Lenoir.  I had been to Lenoir in the past, but inside in a tiny little space.  When I was looking for a place to celebrate some family milestones, I found that Lenoir had outdoor dining.    Since I'm not willing to take my chances with indoor dining at this point, I'm much more willing to \"take my chances\" as to what the weather will be like for outdoor dining and make a reservation.  Also, with most restaurants doing take-out, I'm thinking, if the weather is bad for our reservation, we'll just get take out instead.    As it turned out, I've been able to dine out two lovely meals at Lenoir.  The first was a Sunday evening meal.  We ate early in the evening, and that was great, because we were able to find parking right there at Lenoir, and we had the place to ourselves at first.  We were seated under a tent with propane heaters all around.  The tent is open on two sides, so it's still getting plenty of air circulation even though we had a roof over our heads.  While Lenoir has adapted their dining format to include a la carte ordering, we chose to go with the traditional Lenoir chef's choice tasting menu.    Everything about that evening was magical.  Just going out to eat for a celebration was special.  Then the weather was just fine for dining outdoors, and the wine patio area of Lenoir is so beautiful and romantic.  The tent is decorated with beautiful hanging potted plants, and the uncovered area was dotted with fire pits and chimineas.  Our servers were knowledgeable, personable, and masked at all times.  The food was all delicious and it was a truly special evening.  Through Yelp, I heard that Lenoir is running a special $25 5-course evening dine-in meal through the end of January.  I was looking for a reservation, and could not find any available times that meshed with my schedule, but I saw they now had lunch!  We went for lunch on a foggy, misty day.  We were a little concerned that we would be crowded with too many people within the covered area, and once again, was prepared to get take-out instead of dining in if it looked crowded.  As it was, it must be a well-kept secret that Lenoir is open for lunch, because we had Lenoir to ourselves for most of our meal.  It was once again a super lovely experience.  My husband had a crab stuffed omelette, and I had a winter salad topped with roasted beets, butternut squash, and chicken and the most amazing combination of spices.  For dessert we split a piece of Meyer Lemon Cheese Cake. Everything was super delicious.   When we told our server how we found they had lunch when we were unsuccessful finding a dinner reservation in January, the server asked when we'd like to come to dinner and that he would talk to management about getting us in.  As we were leaving, we were told we have a reservation for early Friday evening.  I can't wait to be back.  Lenoir is a lovely place to safely dine outdoors on some of the freshest best food that Austin has to offer."

                "description": "Great happy hour deals on drinks and wine. The pinky tuscadero and first blush cocktails as well as the capri sunset mocktail were all refreshing on a hot day. Although it was very hot outside, they do have a big tent that covers the tables and they also have fans with misters as well as candles on each table followed by citronella candles placed just about everywhere which is a must because not only are there trees everywhere, but Lenoir backs up to a creek. The mosquitos are out for blood this year (no pun intended), but if you are hoping to escape them by dining indoors, then Lenoir is not for you until the end of September as the inside of the restaurant is completely gutted. I also stinks because on a rainy day, you are SOL; which happened to us so this was our second attempt to dine at Lenoir. However, please do not be discouraged as it is very nice dining outside and romantic if on a date. Just make sure you bring some type of bug spray. Overall, we were impressed and after starting with the pullman bread, we all decided on the tasting menu which is such a bargain, it really can't be beat.  We were impressed with all of the choices except the chicken liver, peach tostado. I love chicken liver, foie gras and pretty much any pate, but somehow the combination just did not go over well. The dorade with blue crab, pullman bread and hush puppies were my top favorite dishes. Vanessa D. was our waitress and she was lovely. I will definitely come back when they are back to indoor dining and the tasting menu has changed."

We shared a few plates, but didn't really care for most of it. The shrimp dish was tasty, but small shareable and overly spicy. The noodle choice was horrible and I don't recommend. The salad was good, but difficult to share. I really wanted to like this place and looked forward to going, but left disappointed."

Came here for date night as we were looking for somewhere outside where we could enjoy the weather. Stopped in for their happy hour and enjoyed the sweet potato Pullman bread along with the smoked fish tartine. Both dishes were fantastic and paired well with first blush cocktail and blood orange ipa which were both on the happy hour menu. The star however was the whole roasted dorade entree dish we ordered. Not only was it super flavorful served in a delicious curry sauce but it was beautifully presented and most of the bones were picked out for full enjoyment. The ambiance really pulled the entire experience together for me as illuminating lights hung throughout the trees and the smell of fire burning in the air. Highly recommend this place if your looking for a special date night or Valentine's Day plans."

I think it was underdone and too hard so it was a bit tough to eat.  The 2 plate bbq dish was good though, especially the brisket (how can you go wrong with brisket?). The \"coleslaw\" wasn't the best and could have used more seasoning and either a better vinegar or mayo base to give it a better texture.  The drinks are pretty good and their atmosphere is overall nice; would definitely go again and check out their HH menu."

The food sucks, and the service is even worse. I came once during July 4thweekend, and it started pouring. Waiters would still bring food on trays that had an inch of water in it, and I was one of those unlucky ones who received food after it started raining. I asked the waiter if it was possible to return my food because it was drenched in rainwater, and he said it was too late because I had already ordered it. Excuse me?? I was genuinely shocked. I went downstairs to ask a manager if I could get a refund, and he said I would have to dispute it with the online ordering system company. Absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't say enough negative things about this establishment. Please, anybody else, do bottomless mimosas because I'm tired of having only this one crappy place be the go-to despite how terrible the service and food is."

Anyway, we showed up to this place and we almost left because it was sooooo packed! It was during their famous brunch time, and so we had to get the mimosa carafe. We ended up changing seats when the bar opened up, so we'd have a view of the game. Loved all the ladies working there. They were nice, friendly, funny, and it made it such a fun day! We ate some loaded fries but added their brisket- omg so good! Also had some fried pickles, but forgot to take a photo."

It turns out that they do not do bottomless mimosas they just sell the bottle or glass by their price. So they should really take off their advertisement of $14 bottomless mimosas because we would have went elsewhere. When we were there, the app that they have went down, so everything was chaotic and no organization was there. My friends and I ordered food and drinks, my friends food came out but mine did not and it was a whole ordeal to get my food. I ended up having them box it up because my friends already finished their food because I didn't want them to wait for mine and have their food get cold. I spoke to the manager on shift and she basically was just trying to make excuses for all their mistakes rather than just own up to them and apologize for all the miscommunication going on that day. Katie, the server, who wasn't even our server, was AMAZING. She was the only one who truly cared about our problems going on and she will literally be the only reason we would ever come back to this place. She should be placed in management. If you do visit here, ask for Katie to be your server because then you will have a great experience for sure!"

Not to mention the food or the East austin energy I felt while brunching here. Everyone is happy and enjoying the beautiful weather. As I got a chance to look at the menu I only took a glance and new exactly what I wanted. The Trifecta is amazing and it just complements an already near perfect experience at eating here."

                "description": "Went today during brunch to celebrate my birthday and my experience was probably the worst I've ever had at any restaurant.  I asked the hostess to place us on the waitlist for a table inside and she tells me it'll be about 30 min wait. In the meantime, my party and I decided to sit outside and order a drink while we wait. We never got a text letting us know that a table was ready.   We stayed outside and ordered food. 3 of us ordered the chicken sandwich, one of us ordered the brunch burger, and another friend ordered the Brussel sprouts. Well, everyone got their food except me. I waited a little over an hour, asked 3 different waiters, until I finally got my food. My entire party was already done eating.   I had also ordered the bottomless mimosas, but I never received that either. Everyone at my table kept getting their drinks, while I was still waiting for mine. I got up, went downstairs, and asked the hostess if she could remove the mimosa from my tab since I never received it.   Food is ok, but service is TERRIBLE. Still can't believe how bad of an experience I had."

There's a small parking lot where I was able to snag a spot so we are off to a good start! Music is good and service was nice and friendly.  Got the smoked wings for an appetizer and bottomless mimosas to start. The wings were good and the homemade bbq sauce was sweet tangy and a hint of spice, *chef kiss. For brunch I got the breakfast taco plate, it was good as well!   Great spot to checkout for bottomless drinks/brunch/bbq"

You have to order and pay through an application which removed the ability to receive our meal in courses. We got appetizers and meal all at once. It took over 45minutes to get our food which was subpar. The cornbread was completely burned. The BLT sandwich literally had one slice of bacon and the queso was lukewarm. This is a foodie town and today's experience was below quality considering citywide options."

The manager came by our table letting us know that the kitchen closed at 9 PM and that there was nothing she can do. Nothing you can do? Not even heat up our food? We let her know that we were disappointed with the food once again and then asked us \"Well when the waiter came by did you guys let him know everything was okay?\" And \"I'm just trying to figure this out... how long did you guys wait to eat your food?\" She was just very defensive and looked terrified at the same time. Then she mumbled something to us and left. I questioned management and tried to figure out if she was even the manager because of the way she handled the situation. My husband and I both looked at each other like what is going on. The waiter came by and let us know our meal was taken care of but we would have to pay for our wine. He also gave us a free appetizer card. We're from Los Angeles so of course we won't be able to use that. I would definitely come back and give this place a second chance if their guest services was better. Unfortunately   food was not great at all and management needs improvement."

Had she approached us more professionally this review would be unnecessary but she was rude and unprofessional. Caroline our server was great and hopefully no one else has to deal with Ashley's unprofessional rude attitude.  This place is great!!! Just stay away from Ashley.

The food was horrible, our brunch burgers had undercooked eggs and undercooked bacon and had absolutely no taste. No one came to check on our tables not once after our food took nearly 45 minutes to arrive and when we tried to make them aware of what was going on with the order, no staff was in sight. Overpriced for such terrible quality food and service. Would absolutely not recommend ever going back."

                "description": "Though it's a hotel restaurant, it's actually pretty good.  Well crafted cocktails and lots of delicious bites to share.  An outside table is especially nice for people watching.  House-Made Zucchini Cornbread: Comes in a cast iron skillet with a nice crispy top.  Underneath is a warm moist grainy cornbread that goes excellent with the butter on the side.  There were green bits in there, but you won't even notice it's zucchini thankfully.  Burnt Ends: An often overlooked meat that is so good!  Came in cubes that were well cooked and nice and tender.  Seemed more wet than typical BBQ, so maybe it was braised?  Either way, it tasted so rich and so delicious against those little dinner rolls.  Three Dips and Chips: I got this for the queso.  And the queso kinda tasted like the traditional Velveeta variety.  It hit the spot for sure, but wasn't anything original/innovative.  Beef Barbacoa Tacos: A huge amount of meat.  Especially loved the crispy shallots on top to give it a nice crunch.  The herbal chimichurri was a great pairing too.  Pork Carnitas Tacos: Very porky and very meaty.  Didn't quite have that fried (after braising) texture that some some carnitas does.  But was still delicious.  Shrimp and Grits: The grits were smooth and creamy.  The shrimp was big and plump, but kinda bland / unseasoned.  Though the tomato sauce on the edges of the grits helped liven it up.  Warm Pecan Brownie: Wow, this was delicious!  It managed to have a lot of delicious crispy edges but also warm gooey center.  And the fresh Texas pecans, way better than when brownies use bitter walnuts.  Really great with ice cream.  Tres Leches: Came in a little mason jar with a smear of dulce de leche on top.  The cake seemed firmer and less soaked than other tres leches I've had before that is just swimming in cream.  But it was moist enough.  And the bites with dulce de leche tasted great."

My plus one almost always goes w the chipotle honey glazed salmon dish and I usually hop around the menu to try new dishes. We always get the trio chips and dip that comes w queso, salsa, and guacamole. We also did try the winter cocktails this time around with the spiced winter old fashioned, very aromatic and delicious. This particular visit I tried the braised wagyu beef tips w a mashed purée and mushrooms. It was very soft, tender, and rich in flavors. I loved that the mash soaked up all the juice and flavors. The roasted vegetables had a rustic approach and although flavorful I wouldn't have missed them on the dish. If you do try the restaurant also be aware you can go into the hotel lobby for a nice lounge feel and casual seating post dinner."

I came recently for lunch on a Friday and they had a limited menu. Came two days later for dinner and AGAIN they have a limited menu. Annoying but nothing one can do about it, apparently they do this any time the hotel is over sold. However, they did serve me 100% raw salmon the last time I ordered it here. It took 20 minutes to get another, and it was the worst meal I've had here unfortunately. My frequenting this establishment will now be limited to booze, apps, or the grouper only (when they have it on the menu...?)  Service is good and drinks are great, people watching is superior.

The food was surprisingly good and our service was awesome. We ordered the nachos (huge portions and our favorite!), burnt ends, and vegetarian tacos. Everything was pretty tasty and came out quickly. The restaurant seems to be pretty large and has a cool indoor/outdoor patio setup too. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're wandering around downtown and looking for a decent spot for food and drinks."

Since our interaction outside was less then stellar we chose to eat inside. (Btw several empty tables outside!) inside had large bar and both booths and tables  Good choice. Attentive waiter.

I am bumping off one star because the food was pricey pricey as well as the drinks. I ordered the Jalapeño Honey Mustard Grouper which was very good but didn't knock my socks off. The cocktails were crafted well and tasty but also pretty expensive compared to other places."

Like, had to wave someone down for a box. Boo.  My food was 50%- the zucchini cornbread was bomb, but the shrimp n grits was lackluster.  Texture of the grit was good but shrimp lacked flavor.  My drink was satisfactory.  I'd say, come for the drinks and grab dinner elsewhere."

The burnt ends were not as crispy as I liked and a little to fatty for my taste. The Brussels sprouts were good but didn't have enough little pieces of pancetta. The staff was overall friendly for the most part. We had to find a place at the bar top since all the tables were full. It was the end of the night and we stayed till last call."

The drinks were unique but worth every penny! The beesnes was our favorite. For an app the trio dip was yummy and lots of food. Overall we will be back this place had great vibes and amazing food!"

I visited for breakfast and getting a seat was not an issue. I had the waffle and a side of sausage, which was pretty good. My guest had the All American with eggs, potatoes, meat and he left a happy plate. The menu is limited but that is cool, it covers the basics. As of eye candy, well it was Sunday morning so mostly kids and couples. However, I  do see potential because they have an outdoor seating area that is a perfect poll position for people watching on the street. I do recommend and will visit again."

The ambiance looked so nice- both outdoor and indoor, and we opted to dine in the A/C. Friendly service, comfy couch-like booths to sit on, and a great menu made it an enjoyable experience.  Our waiter suggested the cast iron zucchini cornbread, which was delicious. A bit dry and crumbly, but very buttery and rich.  Ordered: - Margarita with Don Julio (this was so delicious!) - Red Sangria - Cast Iron Zucchini Cornbread - Barbacoa tacos (so much meat, great portions!) and Pork Carnita Tacos - Mexican Chicken Salad. Presentation is so neat- comes in a \"tube\" that is then lifted so it all falls together. Delicious as well, with a spicy kick!  The only con, was getting charged for a drink we did not order... it was pricey enough! But besides for that, had a great experience overall."

My husband and I stopped in for a drink since we had dined earlier next door and didn't want to overpay for another drink. In retrospect we should of dined here instead because the prices were way better and it smelled amazing.  Anyway, the bar area was nice and plenty of places to stand and or sit in the dining area. The food smelled so good and would love to grab a slice and a drink next time while here. They have gluten free options to include side and pizzas."

Their innovative twists on a classic dish was truly incredible from the first bite when the diversity of flavors exploded on my tastebuds. Also, the price was phenomenal for the amount you get. One small pizza was MORE than enough to fill me up and leave me beyond satisfied. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying all their specialty pizzas. If you're looking for something incredible and affordable, this restaurant is an absolute MUST. Innovative, fresh, affordable, and delicious; it can't get any better."

The chips and salsa could have bought at the convenience store across the street as there was no creativity for $6.  The pretzel and pizzas were top notch.  We tried several of the beers over the course of two visits in two days.  All were really good and I would have the. Again if I ever go back.  The beer bases are awesome as well. Very helpful in finding the right beverage on a hot Texas Summer day.    Worth visiting!!"

Their crust sets them apart from other 'za joints and they craft brews are right up their with any of the big guys (if you know, you know!).   During Covid quarantine, I have been taking advantage of their online beer release ordering and curbside pickup. Yay! Really hope this \"new\" process doesn't change. I also discussed they sell their dough to go, so I've been getting more creative in my own kitchen making pretzels and other yummies.   What else can I say? Nothing really, except go...just go!

(I've discovered I only really LOVE love their specialty pies though - Honey Pear is possibly my favorite pizza of all time and the Banh Mi one is so fun and spicy and there's so many textures and flavors but it all works really well.)  Pictured is The Works and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. But I will always go back!! For Honey Pear  Note: Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm and its $2 off pints of PHP beer as well as $2 off beer mates (cheesy garlic bread). Only complaint is I drink beer too slowly so maybe next time I'll order 2 before happy hour ends ;)"

For example, my friend convinced me to try the honey pear pizza (I was suspicious but got it anyways), the tanginess of the pear with the sweetness of the honey and caramelized onion, with the saltiness of the prosciutto made it one of my all time favorites! Of course, they have \"regular\" pizzas as well, which were also quite delicious. PHP is also a brewery. I won't claim to be a beer connoisseur (it was good beer, that's all I can say), but the combination of beer and pizza here is amazing! Great laid back atmosphere with excellent pies."

My go-to has to be the honey pear, but I've tried most of the others and you can't go wrong. Three slices of the large pizza is sufficient to get me stuffed.   The inside seating is plentiful, yet the place is somehow always packed and very loud (think, so loud I have to shout to hear myself). But the hassles of dining in is still worth eating the pizza fresh and hot. You can ask for to go plates and forks for your party if you'd like to eat elsewhere. There is ample parking and employees are all kind."

We waited around 20 minutes to get seating indoors - but it was well worth the wait. Even though the mask mandate is lifted, they still have covid safety protocols. They explain getting the food, where one person per group goes order the food as they don't want too many people crowded around. It is also required to wear a mask when standing up/ walking around. The seats between each group are well spaced. Based on what I saw, it seems like they got an efficient to-go/take-out system - so that is always an option if the lines are too long.   Now onto the food! For a group of 3 - ordering three medium pizzas was a lot to consume in one sitting. No regrets because this is one of the best pizza places I've ever eaten + with their beer! such a good meal :)  Special shoutout to the honey pear pizza! I love it so much - it is still salty - but the sliced pear, caramelized onions, and honey add so much depth to the taste.   Highly recommend visiting!"

                "description": "This place is as Austin as Austin gets. The spray paint decor really works and the space is cozy but a good place to work in if you need a place to study or work remote.   The drinks at the Spokesman are excellent. I ordered a caramel iced latte and it was very good. The milk options are on the lower end (whole, almond, oat), but the coffee is clean and flavorful and the caramel sweet enough but not overpowering. That said, prices are on the high side for a drink, especially for the size of the drink. It's definitely treat or entertainment coffee and not an everyday affair. Still, when those times roll around, more than happy to get my pick me up at the Spokesman."

                "description": "Entertainment value - Five Stars  Coffee - Two Stars  Long Term Place to Work - Two Stars  Keep Austin Weird - Six Stars  **********  Spokesman Coffee is for all intents and purposes an appendage of the Crux Climbing Center next door.   This is one of those artificial rock wall centers   Where people learn how to climb mountains   Being able to fall on to a mat rather than off of a cliff.  The second floor has huge wrap around windows where you can see the climbers in action.  Watching the climbers is like watching blooper out-takes from American Ninja.  People are just learning how to climb the rock walls.  Climbing rock walls is hard.  There are a lot of shenanigans trying to get up to the next nub.  There are a lot of shenanigans trying to stay on the old nub.  People go down a lot.  They go down a lot in harmless but entertaining ways.  For artistic contrast, there are also the buff ballet dancers of the indoor climbing world.  They are elegant, athletic, and can do all sorts of suave sophisticated moves.  They look even more elegant and athletic because Zeppo and Mimi,   Both Rank 1 Amateurs,   Are doing Three Stooges stuff trying to get up to the third nub.  * * *  If you are not here to watch the Brave Buffoons Falling Off the Wall Show,  then the stock of Spokesman goes way down.  The coffee is terrible.  I had an almost tasteless espresso. The taste that was there was less than wonderful.  My wife did not finish her cafe au lait.  She didn't like the coffee itself.  She didn't like the sweetened alt-milk that had been put in it.  Breakfast tacos were acceptable, but not worth leaving the house for.  As a work place, the tables are very very small.  You will work hard to fit your coffee, your food and your laptop all on the same postage stamp.  Worse - most seating stations have no backs.  This is by probably by design.  They don't have many seats.  They want to encourage you to move along   So someone else can buy some coffee and pay the rent.  There are also some people who can work on backless stools for hours.  I am not one of them.  My lower back gives out over time.  My back gives out over time because of the unusually weighty thoughts I have while I write.  These require extra furniture support.   If you don't like the previous explanation,   You can go with Samuel C. being old and washed up.  He needs a chair so he doesn't fall over while drooling.  Either way, if I am going to get work done, I am going to need better furniture.  Internet provision is very good though.  Give Spokesman credit for that.  The spray paint job on the walls?  All the more reason to watch the climbers.  If you look at the walls, you could hurt your eyes.  * * *  Overall, there are more negatives than positives at Spokesman.  But watching the climbers IS a riot.  If you are working on your grand masterpiece on \"THE DECLINE AND FALL\"  You might be able to do that here.  You can write about the climbers falling off the rock face.  You can write about yourself falling off your stool.  You can write about your espresso cup falling off your microtable.  You can write about how standards in coffee making have fallen off.  If you are there to study for your chemistry exam at ACC,   Your grades may end up falling off too."

My hubby said his americano was the good stuff too. The space is edgy modern cool. Small stools are not comfy. Tables super small. Fun to watch the climbing gym. Close to Blue genie if you are out shopping over their next few weeks holiday bazaar."

It's not frequent that we take a sip of our drinks and comment in amazement, but that was exactly what we did when we picked up our coffee. My iced matcha latte was definitely on the expensive side (~$6) and came in a pretty tiny cup, but it was one of the best matcha lattes I've ordered in Austin. My friend ordered a drip coffee, and he said the acidity and balance was perfect.   The inside of Spokesman is really unique! It seems like a great place to study, and they're open later than many other Austin coffee shops. I would definitely come back again."

                "description": "Great coffee spot sandwiched between Crux, the Brewtorium, and then Blue Genie off to the side. Parking is a plenty, outside seating is kind of not. It's just a couple picnic benches. Inside you can sit upstairs and overlook Crux. The decor is pretty interesting, it's basically a bunch of graffiti but only in black spray paint.  Coffee is pretty solid. I picked up a bag of their Ethiopian beans. It's good but the notes aren't as strong as I hoped. They open relatively late and close early compared to other places. But that's ok because once they close you can move it next door to the Brewtorium!"

Im not sure what roast the cold brew is I feel like it's a lighter one but it gives it a nice flavor while black. It's pretty smooth compared to a few places I've been. They serve vegan tacos which is great and delicious, on the flip side their vegan coffee cake isn't that good. Maybe it needs to be warmed up? I'm not sure. The option to choose your espresso for lattes is amazing and one of my favorite things about this place. You can tell the beans here are quality just from opening and smelling inside the coffee bag if you buy one. I'll be coming more often."

I got an iced pumpkin spice latte (the gourdon ramsay) because it was such a warm day but I recommend trying it hot for the best experience, especially if you appreciate milk texture and want an enhanced flavor of the spices! (Can't go wrong though!)   Same amazing art and vibes as the Elmo location. This space feels a little smaller, but they have an upstairs area. Tables are nice and spaced out, and there's hand sanitizer near the front. :)   Stop by if you're in the area! Might be a little difficult to find at first, but if you're on airport, turn on denson dr and then onto Dillard Cir. There's plenty of parking on the street facing the store."

I had an iced mocha, I usually get it with skim milk but they didn't have that so it was extra creamy than I usually get, super delicious. If you stay in for your visit they have glassware to serve drinks In.   Nice patio out front, and seating on 2 levels inside. Plenty of room to spread out. Free WiFi. Bike racks in front of the shop and I saw plenty of parking but I bet it's tight on the weekend. Inside had music playing but not too loud. You could have a private conversation with no problem.   Covid safety: all employees were masked up, customers need to a mask inside except when eating or drinking.   I like this place and it's close to home, I will be back for sure."

                "description": "My wife and I have been on a question to try as many coffee shops as we can in Austin. Since moving here from Chicago during the summer, we've made our way through our list at a pretty good clip. I'm not sure how Spokesman wasn't on our radar until this week, but boy am I glad we found it. We took advantage of the baby's nap time to walk with her and make the 1.5-mile trek over to their new location off Highland.  What we found was an awesome environment, delicious coffee, and two super friendly baristas.  Kudos to both of them for the engaging conversation on snow, Houston, and peppermint mochas -- and most importantly, for the delicious coffee. If mgmt is reading this, it was the two baristas whoring on the morning of 1/18. One of them was subbing in from another one of your locations.  I can't wait to go back."

I used to manage a place like this and can tell you that for certain my experience would've been more enjoyable if she would've suggested something. Nonetheless she was super friendly!"

Interesting arty decor (maybe a bit overwhelming for old folks like me), and superb coffee/espresso drinks. I bought two bags to bring home and drank it daily while in Austin. I am just finishing off my second bag back home.  In the store, the take home bean prices are excellent, but shipped it is very pricey. So I will have to wait until my next visit to Austin to enjoy it again.  This is my number one pick of coffee places in Austin, and I went to about half a dozen of them in my two weeks there."

                "description": "Been here a few times. I must say that the waiters and waitresses here are phenomenal. During my most recent experience our waitress was Karisha.  Late 30s early 40s generation like me will LOVE the music selection here - I felt like they were playing my old playlists from high school or something!   (And they actually have a barcode to listen to their playlist on Spotify which I thought was cool)  I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. (I had a very paltry breakfast and had recently worked out so my body was lusting for some bovine carnage)  My better half ordered truffle fries and the Gardein Buffalo chicken - which she absolutely loved - and trust me that's a rare sight - so Thank You Yard House!  Meanwhile, this steak had everything I hoped for - it was bone-in, juicy and cooked to perfection. The server even asked me to cut into it to ensure it was to my liking - I had to ask her to repeat herself because I've never had someone ask me before.. how thoughtful! And cut into it I did, again and again until all that was left was the bone.   The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also scrumptious! Just the right texture and not too cheesy at all, the right touch of Parmesan.   Oh and there was also the healthy baby broccoli. The heads were very good, the stem was a little tough for me to chew but that's probably because they are grilled (as opposed to steamed) but that's fine because I usually only eat the heads anyways.   I don't usually drink but they are supposed to have a large selection on tap as well as bottled beers. I had the Heineken 0 (0% alcohol) and for those who used to drink Heineken I recommend it because it tastes exactly like the real thing! I was amazed they had it, so I guess there's something for everyone here.  I think this place is a keeper and I will return to see what other delicious adventures are lurking inside that menu. I've had the steak bowl before and it always hits the spot! The burgers are also delicious - though sadly I'm watching my carb intake recently.   In the end, you can't go wrong with this place! It can get pretty busy but all you have to do is give your name and number and they text you when your table is ready! Just go walk to Restoration Hardware and look at extremely expensive furniture you'll never buy in the meantime or stroll on over to Amazon books and play with their toys :) the possibilities are endless"

                "description": "We've come here almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week since we moved to Austin 3 months ago. The hours are great and the food has always been good, you get a full menu and happy hour specials. I'm not sure if we've been here any other Sunday but this past Sunday the food was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if the head chef, kitchen manager, etc. is off or what but both our meals and appetizer tasted like they were microwaved leftovers.   We got the ahi tuna and it was very strange this time, so strange I didn't want to really eat it but the portion was so small this time we just ate it. I guess that kind of shows we're really not picky so when I say something was terrible it's really-really bad. I know anyone reading this will say that's your fault for getting ahi tuna from a sports bar but we've got it dozens of times and it was always surprisingly good. The tuna sandwich and poke nachos are great as well, but we didn't get them this time. We did get the fish and chips and the hot chicken sandwich. The fish was 100% microwaved, it was rubbery and had no crisp to the breading so they're dead giveaways. Also, the coleslaw was brown so that was nice. The chicken sandwich tasted nothing like the chicken sandwiches we've had from there before, and the taste of this one was not pleasant. We still ate most of our food so I wasn't going to complain that it was terrible unless our waitress asked and to my surprise she never did. lol. I think she knew so she avoided that question.   The cocktails and beer selection is great from here and they make great drinks for a sports bar. During happy hour they have small discounts on drinks and larger discounts on food. I don't remember what they all are but I know the cocktails are 2 dollars off, nothing crazy but hey I'll take it. I ordered my first cocktail during happy hour and about 30-40 minutes later another. The waitress took my order for the drink and came back later maybe 10-15 minutes and asked if I still want the drink I ordered. I was confused and said yeah so another 10 minutes or so I got my drink. My girlfriend was on her phone and noticed she came back to ask right after 11 PM when happy hour is done. So I was charged 2 dollars extra for one drink, I could care less. But it was really weird for her to do that.   I don't think we'll stop coming here because of our bad experience. I figured I would take my time to at least let the establishment know of our experience. So they can improve - if they want to. I know a lot of restaurants have staffing issues and there is a massive amount of competition in Austin. A bad meal isn't the end of the world by any means."

The staff is Amazing and professional but not so much where they're snobby.  Just a kick back place.  While my husband and I sat down at the bar there was a guy watching a game..GO DODGERS!! To our left.. a couple to our right and a blind date across the way. I feeds everyone's needs.   Our bartender KEITH was fantastic...  if your ever so luck for him to make you a drink... you'll be in mixer heaven. He recommended a beer to my hubby some kind of blonde.  Jez I wish I can remember the name... any who, he's gave himself a sample and that was the end of that.  Also, we ordered shots and I ordered a dirty martini.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  DRINK.  Was delicious haha. But also, he was  good company and made sure we're taken care of.   Pros: EVERYTHING!!!! FOOD IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL.  CHEERS TO THE KITCHEN  Cons: nothing. And I always find something that can be"

Finally, last night I had dinner at the Yard, and was so pleased.  First, Miguel, our  young wonderful Server who was just the BESTEST-helpful, kind and patient.  You couldn't ask for more.  Second, the food, the appetizers, buffalo wings and Sushi Nachos were so impressive, fresh and tasty.  The bacon cheese burger were amazing.  Good beef, and delicious fries.  Of course the Beer was good too, and cold.  All in all I am already planning my return until I sampled everything on the menu that appeals to me."

In case you didn't know, during happy hour all their apps are half off.! Unfortunately I only took pictures of the calamari and nachos, however some of my appetizer favorites are the ahi sashimi, poke nachos, fried calamari, and the chicken lettuce wraps. I also like the chicken nachos, classic sliders, and have heard great things about the cheese curds. Often times, I come here for the happy hour and don't even end up ordering an entre just get a few half priced apps!"

I got the KBBQ Cheesesteak sandwich, which had decent flavors and nice presentation. I would personally have preferred a stronger tasting gochujang sauce, but it was still tasty as is. My friend got the whiskey salmon, which had great sauce! The sweetness and whisky flavors mixed very well. I had a pretty good experience overall and was really happy with the atmosphere and waiters! Tim and Noah, you guys were cool!  I also had Yard House in the past once at maybe 1am and ordered their pepperoni mushroom pizza and Margherita pizza, both which tasted great! Definitely a great meal after being out with friends. Would recommend as a fun, laidback place to eat and drink!"

The waitress that assisted me was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. My order came out in a timely manner. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos that came with rice and beans. The sauce that is on the tacos is spicy. For my drink I ordered a Sangria. The food and drink were great!   I sat outside on the patio because it was a nice day outside. The patio is a nice size that has a lot of tables. The restrooms were clean and they are unisex. It's a parking garage across from Yard House which is convenient."

Great spots for drinks after work, happy hour, dinner etc   Eats- we started with the spicy tuna roll but was told it was not sushi! Glad they said something! Was very tasty and without the guilt of the rice!   I got the Baja fish tacos (white fish) it was lightly fried with a nice sauce and slaw on it. I wrapped it in lettuce to lighten it up a bit. However it was delicious! Would 100% recommend this! I also ordered brussel sprouts instead of the rice and beans and they were deliciously fried !   My husband got the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with fries! This was delicious and not super spicy, filled with flavor! Fries were good too! Would recommend this as well.   Worth- the whole check was about $100 after tip. We did get a few drinks as well so that added up. However the portions were large and we felt that it was worth the amount of food and quality of food as well.   Drinks- i got a couple vodka sodas and my husband got the half yard of the left hand milk stout. He loved it !   Services - our waiter was very nice. He checked on us multiple times and refilled waters promptly, he also guided us through the extensive menu and helped us narrow down our choices. Loved that!   Would def come here again! I might bring the pups next time and sit on the patio(when it's warmer)!"

We ordered waters and beers, which they were out of all the beers we wanted to try. Our waitress didn't bring us water for 25 minutes! We had our appetizers basically finished by the time we even had a drink. The poke nachos and cheese curds were awesome and really large. The waitress barely checked on us, and when she did the one time we asked her for sauce and she just never returned for over 15 min. We paid and left without ever getting our sauce. Food and atmosphere were amazing but our waitress truly ruined the experience for us."

                "description": "We absolutely love yard houses HH! We have tried bunch of there appetizers and they are all pretty good, and most of there appetizers are 50% off and pizzas too. But if it's outside the HH time, I this it's bit pricey.  Chicken nachos: skimpy on the chicken and too much of sour cream.  Korean chicken wings: it was pretty good, it had a nice hint with a hint of sweetness and our kiddo loved it.  Onion rings: I mostly don't like onion rings because it's greasy and feels heavy, but at the YH, it's light, crispy and non greasy.  Chicken strips: chicken strips comes with the small basket of fries, chicken stripes itself doesn't have much flavors or seasoning, but it's good if you dip it in some sauce.  They don't have online reservations, so that sucks. Ordering and paying is with the tablet they have on the table and that's not convenient either, we had to try atleast 4-5 times for payment to go through and it's so confusing, otherwise everything else is good."

                "description": "SHAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT!   After dinner last night we decided on going bar hopping. I really don't know the places to go so I trusted my brother and his girlfriend's opinions here. They wanted to show me the places where they have gone on dates and enjoyed.   Whiskers was one of the first stops we made after dinner. My brother told me that this bar had plenty of different rooms that you could go into. So we first walked around and went into each of the rooms before ordering some drinks.   Me being the smart 25 year old that I am decided for the evening since I had already had vodka at dinner I was going to only drink white liquor for the evening because I did not want to screw myself and be really hungry over when my parents got here the next day. (HAHA)!   I looked over the seasonal menu and decided on the Sage Advice drink! It had citrus juices in it as well as vodka. And it was spectacular. All of the flavors in this beverage complimented each other very well. It is definitely one of those drinks I would classify as dangerous. If you had a few of those you might be on the floor. It honestly tastes like juice. So one too many might lead to you not being able to walk. So just be warned.   The inside of the bar was decorated for christmas. They went all out. There were chandeliers at the bars and lights everywhere and even one big christmas tree all decorated in white lights.   It is definitely one of those bars that you need to check out next time you are in Austin. I have only seen it with the holiday decor, but I am sure they decorate it all out for other holidays as well!   The staff and service was great! Very quick and easy. It is a busy bar so you might have to wait a few minutes to get a bartenders attention. But it it all worth it at the end of the night!"

                "description": "An East Austin staple with an eclectic and quirky décor.  If you are looking for a quiet, stuffy cocktail bar, this place is not what you're looking for (at least on the weekends). I would characterize it as sort of a slightly dressed up dive bar with some very unique vibes. The interior has the feeling of an old wild west sort of saloon, crossed with an old cathedral, crossed with an old hunting lodge. Past patrons have written messages on the walls and it is interesting reading some of their musings while sipping on an old fashioned. The exterior bar is fairly standard, although there is a random bath tub located in the middle of the backyard area, which is another interesting quirk.  Generally, the cocktails here are quite good; sometimes they pre-make the cocktails in a larger batch, cutting down on the wait time a bit. My experience has generally been positive with the pre-made cocktails.  One downside here is that it is very popular and is therefore quite crowded much of the time. During the busiest hours on weekend nights, you can expect to encounter a line to get in and another line to get drinks. That said, if you're with the right company, a few minutes wait for cocktails is pretty tolerable.  If you are visiting Austin, this is one good spot to check out to experience the \"charm\" of the area. Additionally, being on 6th, this place is very walkable to other bars and makes for a great place to start or end the night."

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and had the best time getting some drinks while sitting on the patio. The bartenders are awesome and extremely helpful when ordering.   We ordered a few drinks, and we loved each one of them! They even offer happy hour 2-5 daily which includes an old fashioned, a gin lavender drink, mule, and many more. As we were leaving the lines for the bar were getting pretty long, however the bartenders move pretty quickly so the wait was not too bad.

The bar upstairs is a mezcal tasting room which has yet to disappoint me. The bartender will tailor your tasting to what you and your guests are interested in trying and also ensure that the space isn't too overrun by other guests. Push through the crowd and add this bar to your itinerary when visiting Austin and I can assure you won't be disappointed with the experience."

It was a hot afternoon, and it got a bit uncomfortable inside (no a/c), but it would be an awesome place on a cool fall day (the four we have in Austin!). I tried the old fashioned first, having heard it was \"signature.\" It did not disappoint! My second drink was not as good (something to do with ambition in the name?), so I will stick to the old fashioned next time.   Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that I didn't feel any sort of discrimination. Having read some of the other reviews, I was a little nervous to visit as older than 30,  but I found no problems at all. I had no issues getting drinks. Only once did an employee act like a jerk because the inside bar was closed, but that wasn't readily apparent, and he got snippy that I was waiting there. He did it with others, too, though. I think everyone's experiences are valid, but my experience was not that this bar only caters to picture perfect 20-somethings."

Definitely recommend going after dark because the setting of the inside of the bar is part spooky/part western-y/part old-timey and kinda makes you feel like you could meet a vampire in the corner... but in a cool way! I have had many different drinks from their set menu but admittedly their bartenders know high quality cocktails on and off the menu so order your heart's wishes.   My most recent order: - Twisted Nerve - Fancy, not-too-sweet, and so refreshing on a warm day! - Whisler's Old Fashioned - Smooth and will put some hair on your chest.  Give this bar a shot! Or take a shot... No judgement here."

Every person who visits me here in Austin leaves a fan!  They don't have casamigos and you definitely can not get a Vegas bomb! No beer on draft but there are 3 canned options (hans pils, fire eagle IPA, and a golden ale brewed specially for whislers by a local brewery.)   Sometimes it can take a little minute to get a drink but that's just life baby! I promise you the wait is worth it."

                "description": "Last night my wife and I made the mistake of going to another cocktail bar that wasn't Whislers. Big mistake. ~$30 and 45 unimpressive minutes later, we hightailed it over to East 6th.   First thing I noticed is that they nixed their dinky parking situation to make room for even more patio tables. Perfect. It's not like Whisler's really needed the space, but with the interior bar unmanned and COVID in the air, it's a welcome addition.  I'm always surprised when people say the cocktails here are unimpressive. I don't know where else they are drinking (in ATX at least), but I'd appreciate a clue-in. Whisler's does a damn fine job; we always drink too much here because we can't stop sipping on inventive and tasty cocktails.   Last night's outing had two standouts I'd like to highlight. First, the Drab Majesty. With rum, cachaça (a fermented sugarcane liquer), beet, raspberry and lime, the drink struck a sweet spot between sweet and savory, with some carribean flair to boot. Next, the Feel Good Hit of the Summer, mint julep-inspired with an attitude. Couching the bourbon inside a fruity melangerie of cantaloupe, apricot, lemon and lemongrass made for a supremely sippable summer drink - a sublime libation if I ever had one.   Last note; I love coming to Whisler's and walking out having tried multiple types of alcohol I never knew existed. It's always fun to learn a thing or two!"

I got this mezcal drink with turmeric and it was so good. I like the smoky taste of mezcal so I enjoyed it. Btw, if you like mezcal, don't forget to check out the \"secret\" mezcal only bar they have upstairs. The bartender will help you select one based on whether you wanna shoot or sip (definitely sip it) and your price point. It had cool music playing, there was incense going, and it had a whole hipster surfer tantric meditation vibe going. If you live in Austin or just visiting, go there for a drink or two."

To my surprise, I got a great drink without the waiting part. I had a twisted nerve which was fantastic. Not sweet, not dry, just really smooth. The other patron in my party had an old fashioned and said it was perfect!  The prices are great for how strong the drinks are. The music and energy were reminiscent of the speakeasies. I definitely recommend and will be visiting this establishment again to try some of the other drinks on the menu."

My favorites were the Twisted Rita and Sweet Sow. The Shrooms to the Moon had some good umami to it -- it's the most flavorful, but a bit heavier than the first two. Also -- if you like pizza rolls, then I would definitely try the Rollin' Ronies.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the near future.  Note about ordering: I ordered online and picked up the food. I will say, however, that the order was not ready by the estimated time. Instead, you can wait for a text notification to pick up the order. I didn't know that, but now I do!"

There is conflicting info on Yelp and their website. I called ahead because going to the wrong pickup spot would turn me into a hangry rage. They did not answer the phone but the host breweries did. CONFIRMED: They are currently located at Celis brewery.   We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup on Grubhub on a Friday night. BackDraft and pepperoni. They were ready in about 30 minutes. CONFIRMED: The pizzas were AMAZING. Like... hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their homemade sausage and humongous thin pepperoni slices were phenomenal.  I can't speak for anyone else's experiences recently. It sounds like delivery may be questionable? But as of April 2021, if you can drive to pick up a pie, this is the place you need to go."

It's topped with House Made Spicy Sausage, Pepperoni, Fresh Jalapeños, but we also added mushrooms on ours.  It's a thin crust style pizza that is PACKED with flavor.  Our buddy ordered the Kale Yeah Caesar salad which he was very pleased with.  The guys that run this truck are really cool and definitely dedicated to their craft.  Backdraft Pizzeria is definitely up there on the short list of Austin's best pizza.  I'd be surprised if they didn't branch out and open up another location in the near future, especially in the downtown Austin area.  I would highly recommend giving them a visit and try their food.  How can you say no to a fantastic pizza and a frothy craft beer to go with it?"

                "description": "TLDR: BackDraft is back, and they're better than ev-VAH!  I'm a longtime fan of BackDraft, even once calling it 'the best pizza you can get off a truck'.  That's damning with faint praise, as this is some of the best pizza in all of Austin.    Back when I first tried them, the food truck was parked down on 360 near Bee Cave.  But now that both I and they have moved to the north quadrant of Austin, and they're attached to an excellent brewery to boot!  By far, my favorite is a slightly altered 'Shrooms to the Moon', which is a triple-whammy combo of homemade spicy sausage, mushrooms, and carmelized onion. If you look at the picture, you'll see that the crust has the  right amount of 'char' or 'leoparding' as some call it.   Whoever's doing the pizza-slinging at BackDraft knows their stuff. Get down here when they're open, grab a brewski, and you're in for one of the best lunch combos that Austin can serve up!  Some Tips:  1) I said 'best lunch', but be sure to check their hours before you come. I'm pretty sure they just do lunch Friday and Saturday.  Otherwise, they follow brewery peak hours and just do evenings.  2) Try the Shrooms to the Moon but ask them to hold the caramelized onions.  Without the onions, you get a spicier, hotter pizza which goes perfectly with a pale ale beer to wash it down.  You'll end up with a pizza-nirvana feeling of a warm glow in your tummy.  This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

                "description": "I've been known to enjoy eating a cold slice of pizza for breakfast. Assuming, of course, that it was leftover from the night before. But this pie from BackDraft pizza ARRIVED cold.  The fact that it was skimpy for the cost pretty much assured that there weren't going to be any leftovers. From one perspective; that could be a blessing. Because while it wasn't the worst pie I've eaten; it would easily place among the bottom three. Two stars is more generous than this deserves."

I had the chicken and the brisket and both were really good , seasoned well and very moist - cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish my salad and took maybe half of it home. So, portion wise, this is also a win. My daughter had the 1/2 ribs and we were all taken by surprise on the flavor. Seriously, TRY their RIBS!!!  They have a selection of different sauces, including a strawberry one that came with the ribs. I was very skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well. However, their mustard based one is my favorite.  We can't wait to be back!"

                "description": "Great BBQ for an even greater price! I was really impressed with everything we tried, and for it all being just under $50, it was worth it. It's not your \"traditional\" BBQ stop - the menu is really fun and there are some pretty creative treats to try, from Texas-sized sandwiches to habanero strawberry glazed ribs. The meats were tender as could be, the flavor was incredible, and the sauces were amazing. Will definitely be visiting again!   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Individual food ratings: - Habanero Strawberry Glazed ribs (5/5): sweet and spicy (but more sweet), these ribs were perfectly tender and had really great flavor! You can get them without the glaze, or get the glaze on the side. - Smoked Gouda Mac'n'cheese (4/5): pretty tasty mac, very cheesy and creamy, would be great with hot sauce or meat. - BBQ nachos w/brisket (5/5): super loaded, huge shareable portion, and great flavors! Add extra sauces on top to get saucy. - El Jefe sammie (5/5): brisket, onions, peppers, and Fritos for some crunch, this was a great sandwich and super filling! - Twice baked potato casserole (3/5): needed a kick or maybe some more salt/pepper, but was good overall with the dank white sauce on top."

The menu pretty easy to survey and food comes out quick fresh and hot! Those are the things I love quick fresh and hot. The prices are appropriate and the sides are reasonably priced. Also the baked beans was the business. Oh, yeah the nortorious BIG was delicious! It's topped with Cole slaw and piled with brisket very tender meat!   I love this place and it was a short drive from the hotel."

The pulled pork sandwich had very good flavor and the Mac and cheese was fabulous. They also serve beer which complements BBQ , IMHO. The service was courteous and prompt. The dining area was clean, though we opted to sit in their temporary outdoor seating area because it was a beautiful day. Check it out as an alternative fast food option."

The have 4 types of sauces, I sampled them all and my fav has to be the backyard red sauce. We ordered the Texas OG on a tortilla and the Tony Montana. The brisket was meaty and fatty. The Tony Montana could have had more queso on it for sure. We also tried the gouda Mac and cheese amd twice baked potato and it was creamy and pretty good. The potato was just ok according to my boyfriend. They are located in a strip mall with lots of parking."

We thoroughly enjoyed our meal! Our party of three started with the double meat bbq brisket nachos, then we shared 1/2 # of ribs, a Texas Tornado wrap with double brisket (absolutely LOVE their brisket) then added an extra large order of the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese, green bean casserole and finished up with a banana pudding .  Gotta say I haven't eaten such great bbq for years AND took home enough for another meal.  This is my new go-to for Austin BBQ! They have a nice selection of regular and craft beers as well.  Definitely a repeater!!"

The sliders, brisket nachos and chicken sandwich were all delicious. The max n cheese was good, it had a smoky flavor, like it was cooked on the grill. The potato salad didn't have any flavor but we just know not to order it, it was a side and not the star of the show like the meats. The music was great! If I lived here, I would definitely be here once a week! Great food and vibe!"

The line was long, but luckily I was able to head to the to-go desk and place my order fairly quickly...Brisket Nachos packaged with all the ingredients separated so as not to get soggy. They easily survived the drive home to Cedar Park and were super delicious and unique! Like a chopped brisket sandwich on tortilla chips with queso. Um, yes, please.  This barbecue place has a vibe like no other. The walls and music combine hip hop with classic Texas in a way I would not have dreamed possible, but it works. Pretty trendy spot. I really appreciated the clear partitions separating tables as a covid precaution."

The St. Louis ribs are some of the most tender I've had.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce that came with the ribs but it's on the side and they have other sauces available as well- the one it came with was a little sweet for me. Planning on bringing my small rib aficionado this weekend after the pumpkin patch.  One complaint... the kids meal ribs says it comes with two.. TWO. Mine will be asking where the rest are if I ordered him a kids meal  they do have a great amount of meat on them but I have a 3 year old that eats like a teenager when he has ribs in front of him so these kids meals won't work for us  we will be getting a whole rack and I'll be lucky if *I* get to have two."

Right when you walk in, the smell hits you, and you know you've picked the right place.  Not only do they have great food, they have a bar with beer, several flat screen TVs and a nice-sized patio area. I had the BBQ nachos with extra queso and rib meat; it had jalapeños, diced onions and pickles and one of their signature bbq sauces drizzled on top. My meal was so amazing, and the portion size was enough to get full and still have half of the plate to take home(which is equally amazing after reheating in the oven)."

We knocked off a star bc some of the meat was dry, the smoked mac was very runny and the coleslaw wasn't too good but overall enjoyed our meal. We allotted more time here for lunch bc we assumed there'd be a lunch rush and orders would be slower if meats were being smoked throughout the day but our meal came out almost instantly so stuff was ready to go / could have contributed to some of the meat being dry....  * Slab slider trio - sliders of Notorious PIG, Texas OG and Chicken WA. Notorious was very good flavor and pulled pork was still nicely moist. The Texas OG was kind of a let down bc the brisket was dry and there wasn't a lot of sauce on the sandwich to keep it moist and flavorful. The chicken WA was actually pretty good and the chicken surprisingly stayed moist * El Jefe - hubby got this was and liked it.. the brisket wasn't as dried as it was on my Texas OG * Smoke gouda mac - I love macs and this was way too runny, wish the sauce was more creamy * Cole slaw - my hubby is a cole slaw snob and he thought this didn't really have enough flavor  They had outdoor seating so we got to people watch but it is in a strip mall, so not too much to see.  Woman at the counter was very nice and gave recos for us while we were ordering."

                "description": "We came from San Antonio to try this place out due to great food reviews.  There are no servers that come to your table, if you want food you have to order at the bar. The staff wasn't very friendly at all and of course didn't have good customer service quality's.  The lighting inside was very dim and dark - more like a bar setting but the variety of appetizers was great. The D.J. was playing some good tunes and when our food came out - They had the best wings and Cheese Waffle fries. We had a couple of drinks and ordered a couple more appetizers but then we saw the WORST - A RAT ran above us on the beams and then my husband and cousin saw another RAT in front of him running along the opposite end!!!  And we all know if there is 1/2 rats their are more to follow. Obviously this is an issue that they are aware of. Needless to say we grabbed our stuff and left! I felt so disgusted and nauseous!!!  Coming out the restaurant we met a couple (locals) outside and they told us they have heard as well about infestation of rats. So if your looking for a good restaurant- Don't come here!!!"

                "description": "The Jackalope in downtown Austin. It was a blast great drinks and it attracted great people. The food was even good, including the drinks. I would go back for sure, pretty cool atmosphere as well.  When I went I had done research and everything. There are other places to go to but, this was the best for a Sunday. I arrived just a bit before happy hour and enjoyed myself.  I had the Jackalope burger and it was plenary to eat. With the toppings I didn't even need anything else. I usually get honey mustard and mayo, I didn't need it but, I did put mayo on it. There were plenty of pickles and the burger meat was tasty.   I had a frozen margarita, the frozen was out after that and I switched to a hibiscus margarita. I know your thinking hibiscus flower, yea it was even pretty like the flower. I also had the huge Heldarado as well. Man let me tell you now have a few people would help you finish but it was good.   It was just great company we had fun there I met a couple cool people there and it was rememberable. It's kind of what we are looking for when we go out to eat or something. The server was good even when they switched out for shifts, the only thing I will get you don't want us they could use a few more extra service. Great experience I definitely go back."

The giant jackalope inside is very insta-friendly, they tell you to feel free to hop on and take a pic.   Our bartender was really friendly and funny, and served us right away. He gave us a few suggestions, and we ordered drinks and a round of shots. They were all good and mid-priced. The only downfall was they didn't shake the pineapple chaser, so it was lukewarm.   Overall, a solid and memorable bar experience!"

                "description": "Food was good when it came out correctly but had to send back what was put in the computer versus what I asked for.    Tonight October 30, 2021. I put a food order in for honey jalapeño wings, an order of waffle fries and a dos xx draft. Total came to 22 and was given order number 80 around 8:00 Pm. Order came out as a burger and side of fries which after checking your menu, should've only been 14$ plus what ever the beer was which I'm sure isn't 8$ for a draft beer in a plastic cup.   I informed the food runner it should've been wings and he showed me where the food was rung in as a burger instead, no harm no foul a simple misunderstanding or so I thought. The bartender who rang it in informed me I ordered a burger when I \"shouted\" my order at him and said I like that with fries. By my calculations, if I did intact order the burger with a side of fries it should've been 11.5 for burger plus 2.5 for fries. Not almost 16 I'm assuming plus 6$ for a dosxx.   I get it it's Halloween weekend. But if you can't fully hear the order then just make sure with customer before finalizing and putting order in and over charge them if in fact you thought I ordered a burger. But also don't give attitude when customer asks for the wings and believes the wings only come with 8 like you PDF menu states. Not from Austin but will not be back anytime soon. Unfortunately I paid in cash or I would ask for a refund for the difference because I'm entitled to that I believe. I understand customer isn't always right. But food costs can't be that high that you need to argue about the wrong button being pressed on your end.   And yes this is the exact same review I sent to the contact us for on the website, I'm sure nothing will change with how orders are put in on busy nights, but just make sure you get your itemized at this establishment so that you know before you walk away from bar."

I understand circumstances are weird due to COVID-19.  I get that. We ALL get that. We are in Austin visiting for our best friends bachelorette and on our second night here we decided to take the advice from our waiter at Caroline's and go to The Jackalope.  We went there at 9pm just to check it out and our bartender, Bart, gave us complimentary drinks. We were so thankful, we paid for the giant mixed drink and went next door for a few hours and then went back to The Jackalope because the bride requested it. We sat down for 20 minutes even ordered some drinks (which they never brought) and they were playing the jams -- so naturally we started dancing around our table.   Even the other bartender, Dimitrius, was hitting on one of our bridesmaids HEAVILY and hanging around with us while we were dancing - not even one whole song went by before Dimitrius told us we couldn't be dancing and that we needed to be in our seats. We said okay, that sucks but sure. So we sat down and made sure our butts where planted -- next thing you know some random came up to us and started twerking at our table then on jumped on the couch and started twerking and spreading her legs in the air. Again - SHE WAS NOT WITH US. None of us even knew who she was. Immediately, some angry bartender (that clearly needs to get laid) with a ponytail ran over to us being loud and demanding that WE get out meanwhile Twerker conveniently slinks on back to her table    I can understand if we were the ones doing THAT and you wanted to kick us out - FINE.  But that was not the case. No one wanted to even hear us out, one of our bridesmaids does not drink and she was very civil in trying to explain to Ponytail Bartender but he literally was non-stop raising his voice to us. He even yells at Bart to come over - and this fool just straight up decides to \"go with his boys on this one\" and preceded to gesture us to get out  Ponytail could not WAIT to kick us out, let me tell you. Like there's some underlying issues there  He yelled at us saying \"You're not even ordering drinks! You're not even ordering food!!!\" NOPE. Wrong again, Ponytail.   We DID order food and drinks but your stubborn hating ass didn't accommodate us  Meanwhile Twerker (aka THE PROBLEM) is still running rampant inside the bar   Also, the pink haired lady was GOD AWFUL. Not helpful whatsoever.  Bart you were the biggest disappointment, and Ponytail -- you just suck. Thank you for ending our night horribly and giving us a HORRIBLE first trip experience.   I do not recommend this place whatsoever for anyone who is looking to actually have a good time."

I got the wings and the fries and was super impressed. The mango jalapeño I think was really fresh and good and the fries where hot.

And for a minute, I thought: the competition is getting tough... There are cheaper ways to go out and play board games now, and there's always tons of places to eat in Austin   But honestly, Vigilante still deserves five full stars because they provide a unique experience you can't get anywhere else. The service is EXCELLENT. The wait staff is always extremely friendly and makes you excited to be there. The game masters are truly that, and can teach you a game as fast as possible. The food is also much improved and truly enjoyable. While also staying out of the way of the real focus: playing games with friends!  By always innovating and keeping the experience top notch, Vigilante will always have a spot in my rotation."

It's got everything you could want for a nice fun evening.  Ordering system is pretty simple - just tell your server what game you want and they go fetch it. Once you're done, flag someone and pick another game.  Food is pretty simple and if you order three things all at once, it's a little cheaper. I wasn't particularly hungry the couple of times I went but the pretzel bites are decent with queso. The sandwiches and milkshakes also don't look bad though I can't vouch for it. They got a lot of drinks on tap too.  Sit back, kick back and relax!"

The room really made our night special with the insanely detailed decor, Bluetooth speaker to customize the gaming vibe, and remote controlled fan for comfort. The waitresses were also so kind and we all felt right at home. We ordered almost every drink and small plate on the menu. I recommend ordering an old fashioned and the dumplings - the sauce was so good! In the main area, they had a nerf gun war planned to end NYE along with a champagne toast. Everything they do is well thought out - definitely give it a try!"

I understand they want to keep it snack size so you can focus on gaming, but when you make things gluten free, i.e., take away the buns, the portions get reduced significantly, but the prices don't get reduced at all."

                "description": "This is such an amazing concept and we had a blast!  Our group of 4 came here for an adult game night and were not disappointed.  They have a huge variety of board games to choose from.  These game range from easy to hard, long play to short play.  We ordered several different appetizers to share as a table and we each had a burger.  The appetizers were decent and the burgers were very small but pretty good.  This place is definitely not about the food but about the games.  It is good for the snackable items, but I wouldn't plan your dinner here.  The drinks are good and very reasonably priced.  We had a reservation for two hours, but we ended up staying there for about 3 and a half hours and we were not kicked out or asked to leave.  The staff was all super friendly and helpful.  This is definitely a spot that we will be back to."

                "description": "I've been here many weekends since moving into the Crestview neighborhood. It is easily the best bar in walking distance. Cocktails are amazing. Bar food is delicious and perfectly snackable. You can never have just one plate. The staff is always friendly.   By far the most unique and best part is the extensive bored game library. This makes it the perfect gathering place for parties small and large to get together for some wholesome and competitive fun. The thought put into this aspect is also plain to see. The design of the tables, the food choice, and the atmosphere makes this the perfect place for the next role of the dice or grand strategic victory. For large parties and special events, ask about the hidden rooms."

The food options are super cheap and they are all SO good! You can choose from 60+ board games on the app too- we played Clue and Bad Medicine. Overall it was a great experience and I highly recommend if a group is looking for something to do at night time!"

And I love that the game selections are so well organized by type, difficulty level, #of players, etc. If you've never heard of a game or are unsure of what to pick, the staff is super helpful in recommending or explaining game options. For one occasion we reserved one of the private rooms for playing some DND and it was super cool! It's hidden behind a bookcase! Also, the bathrooms are nice. Just saying."

                "description": "Super fun board game bar! All boardgame boxes have been replaced by custom wooden boxes.  You can check out one box at a time. They do split the check individually since it's a handheld POS system that they use.  Majority of your party must be there in order to be seated, otherwise you can just wait at the bar. If you choose not to play board games, you can hangout at the bar and they'll give you switch controllers so you can play smash on their projector screen.  I saw that there was 1 hidden room, behind the bookcase, which I can only assume people can rent out for private parties. There is free parking out front in the garage.  -1 star because service was painfully slow."

                "description": "Man what a gem this spot is! If you haven't been, you mos def need to go. From groups of 2 to about 8, you're gonna have a great time from their lengthy list of board games, small and easy plates, plus brewskies or cocktails! Came here with three friends on MLK night and it was busy! But we were able to get our gaming in. FYI, at night it's a bit tough to see the store sign, but it's right at the corner/entrance of the apartment complex it's near!  Inside - 5/5 The left side of the spot has long benched tables with booths lining the wall/corner. If you sit in this at area, the staff give you a cool plasma-esque lantern so that you can call them over for food, libations, and games. The back of the left side is a bar with a projector in the behind. But what really sets the inside are the four person tables on the right side that are outfitted for perfect board and card games. Each side of the table has compartments where you can put your personal items, a cup for rolling dice, and a slider for cards. There are swinging sections at each corner to put your drinks or other items. Lastly, each side has a button that turns on a light right above the table to let the staff know you need something! P legit.  Food - 4/5 There are two pretty cool three plate deals you can order for $12 as you partake in the games. So far I've had the tacos, fries, and rolls and they weren't that bad. Nothing to write home to, but would be nice with larger portions. If ya don't do the deal, the  plates a la carte are of course a bit more expensive. Also, they can gluten-free most, if not all options! The beer and cocktail selection is pretty nice. Again, nothing out of this world, but cool you can really spend hours here.  Games - 5/5 The best part of Vigilante is of course the games. As several of the menu photos depict, they have a full menu of categorized games (e.g. adventure, party, cards, board). They also break it down by how difficult the games are to learn, set-up, and play. They of course have your staples - Settlers of Catan, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens - but there are plenty of more games that you can try with your friends! For example, we tried Sushi Go (a quick card dealing game to get the most points) and it has now become one of our go to games! The fun part is that the games are placed in a protective wooden box, which makes you feel like you're accessing a side quest of some sort.  Tips! Like a night club, it's $5 per person to sit at a table and play! And it's unlimited games all night. Your group can only one game at a time. Sit at the 4 person tables I described above! You won't regret it! You can order per person - the staff have mobile card readers  Overall - 4.5/5 I don't think any place is perfect as I believe it's always fun to continue building and making something better. Nevertheless Vigilante is a must go place for a date, a \"night in\", or what have you among other game loving fellows. It has everything you need and you're not risking yourself in the crazy scary world out there. Don't do yourself a disservice and go go go (Power Rangers)!"

                "description": "Overall poor customer service. Visited for happy hour today with friends, and ambiance initially was nice. Their system of notifying staff with flicking lanterns only however encourages neglect for tables; we were never notified that apparently staying for more than 90 minutes meant EVERY guest at the table was charged their game fee, despite us never using any of the games.  Poor communication. We weren't even told of this option by any staff. Once we asked for our checks we were each notified of the surcharges, which honestly felt like I was being scammed because there was no communication given to us. No itemized receipts for me to prove this either, just electronic signatures on a page where the default tip was the highest amount percentage. Bad service but I still tipped 18% because there weren't any other options. Seems like Vigilante is just sneakily after your money, doesn't sit right with me.   Extremely small portions of sides and appetizers. Beer and cider was average selection and price. There are better places for happy hour that don't try to scam you with hidden fees."

You order games from a menu (they have an amazing collection) just like you would order food. They have some good vegetarian options. I felt that portions are small when compared to other restaurants. But if you are here to spend time with your friends, that should be ok. The \"choose your own adventure\" was $12 for 3 items ok the menu. It costs $5 per person to play the games if you are sitting in the general seating area.  This could be a really good place to just hangout with your friends and have a good time. They are also open until super late!"

                "description": "Terrible experience! We decided to go here last night after dinner (group of 4) and we called ahead to see if we needed a reservation. We were told no, they keep some tables available for walk ins. When we arrived it was 8:55 and the host told us we were 3rd on the list because there were some 9pm reservations coming in. Ok, no problem we waited outside. Slightly confusing to us though because the place was half empty. The host said it's because they're still operating at 50% capacity. Um...why? Texas opened 100% back in March. Anyway, waited outside. 9:00 comes and goes, 9:10, 9:20...so we go inside to ask what's up? No people ever walked in while we were waiting. We were told that if the 9pm reservation doesn't show then they call and text them to ask if they're still coming and give them time to get there. This was ridiculous! We had been there 30 minutes..the only people waiting on site..we had money to spend there..and we had to wait just in case someone decided they wanted to show for their reservation 30 minutes late. So back outside, there's an open table that's just been sitting open so we decide to seat ourselves. We ask a server if we can get some drinks and he says he'll be back. A few minutes later another guy comes outside to tell us we can't sit there, they're waiting to see if the 9pm folks are going to show. It's 9:30!!! At this point we are fed up and argue with the guy about this \"policy\". We finally said we would just leave because it's obvious we weren't welcome, our money wasn't needed (although idk how since 50% capacity isn't good business for anyone). To top it off, as we are getting up to leave the man who I assume is some kind of shift lead tells us NOT TO COME BACK! Great business you're running here. Such a disgusting experience."

Mainly wanted to write this review because I noticed there were no pictures of the brunch menu anywhere I could find online. Saturday and Sunday, 11-2, if you come and do the pick 3 for 10.50 brunch they waive the $5 game fee. My table tried every dish and there were no misses. Here are a few notes: -Loved the mini smoothie bowl (it's more like a little cup) -Taco is great just be sure to add bacon and you may want to ask for extra hot sauce  -Bacon pancakes come as stack of 4 and they are baseball sized, so pretty good deal -Hash-browns are also a pretty decent portion   I don't really need to speak to the game menu; they have a vast and varied collection and there is multiple things for everyone.   A must go for a low-key brunch option :)"

                "description": "I came here with a group who rented out \"The Wizard's Office,\" one of the private rooms available. They state the capacity is 12, but I can't even imagine how uncomfortable that would be. Not only would there be little room to maneuver yourself around, but it would be swelteringly hot. Even with our party of 8 it became stuffy. Service was the biggest issue: waitstaff were unresponsive to the push-button service request, often taking 10 minutes to come in. Waitstaff also had to be asked over 4 times to bring additional water until it finally arrived.   There's a good selection of games, although it can be hard to find what you want given the proximity of other tables to their game selections, and that they are all in their own custom boxes, making it more difficult in some aspects to locate a game, as they're not as easily identifiable.   I'm trying to find a good way to describe their food, and the only descriptor I can think of is, meh. I'm happy we went to Top Notch before coming in, as the food is small, and they didn't \"course it out\" as described. Instead the food came within minutes of one another, clogging up the table. Not to mention, one of the people in the party later ordered a burger, for it to take over 40 minutes to appear.  Will I come here to play games again? Yes. Will I come here to eat or drink? No. Best you stop off at any of the other numerous restaurants in the area beforehand."

                "description": "First, this place is perfectly nice and probably worth going to again if I am back in the area but would easily be convinced to try something else.  My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

                "description": "Wife and I decided to try this place out for late afternoon brunch on the patio. We had the Bacon Beignets, Reuben, and Pimento Burger. We had a little difficulty finding good selections on the menu. Citrus pancakes sounded good, but they were out of them. The Bacon Beignets were the highlight, warm, freshly made and tasty. Reuben was good, with nicely salted corned beef and delicious German slaw. Pimento burger was too rich for my taste. Service was good. Overall experience was good. Would be 5 stars, but menu was not great for us. If you find things you like on the menu, then you should try it out."

                "description": "The meal was much more attractive than it was delicious. Everything was fresh but lacked flair in the flavor department. This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

We were in no hurry so we had another beer and looked over the menu.  It was obvious that Oast was short staffed and everyone was doing double duty. Thank the pandemic!  Nevertheless, tHe staff was very friendly and the service was adequate.  However our burgers were not very hot and my pretzel bun was stale. The fries were very good. In better times, this will probably be a very nice dinner option."

However, it's laid back, chill atmosphere, and modern feel makes it a great spot for almost any occasion.  The food was pretty good. I did get something i could make at home. However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough. But still good.   Mimosas were a good deal as well!   Overall we had a great time and most likely will return again!"

We came here because we found some good reviews on Yelp, but have to say I was a bit apprehensive about how long it's been since the last review posted for this place.   This restaurant seems to be a family go to place where people just eat and never care to leave a review.   This place a gem! We came in for an early dinner and were surprised by how good their food and drinks are.   I wasn't really found of the butternut squash soup but we were in the mood for trying so we did it.   I do recommend this place for anyone.  Specially if you are looking for food away from Downtown like us.   Enjoy!"

                "description": "Came here for brunch after church on Sunday. I must shout out Henry because his service was awesome. He was personable, friendly and efficient. His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

The service was really good (and timely/efficient) and we enjoyed the covered seating outside. They had a great beer/cocktail/wine selection and had several drafts i had never seen before. The chicken and waffles were really strong, and the chicken was almost like hot chicken which was a pleasant surprise and carried the dish but no complaints there. The carnitas poutine and the Cubano were certainly enjoyed as well"

                "description": "Oasthouse has been my periodic GrubHub treat when my standbys on another delivery service aren't available for several months. What more does one need in life when brie pimento burgers and coffee rubbed carrots with green peppercorn ranch are on the menu? I don't even mind that my average order for one meal is at least 35-40.00 with delivery. Sometimes it's just worth it for something so yummy.   I was excited tonight to share an Oasthouse experience with my daughter and was pretty disappointed at both a mediocre meal and pettiness on my bill. Even though I was happy to spend the 45.00 plus 20.00 delivery charges and tip to reward ourselves after a strenuous and stressful day of work, I felt shortchanged pretty quick when I couldn't even see the pimento on my burger, got an overly dry bun and was charged 2.00 after the fact for some perceived \"extra\" change to my order.   Whether this was an upcharge because they were out of mashed potatoes (usually substituted for fries since I'm gluten free) and gave me the more expensive brussels sprouts. Or maybe they changed me for the extra pimento I always ask for (#swoon) but didn't get. Since they didn't say what it was for I'm left wondering.   All in all, my highly anticipated Oasthouse indulgence fell kind of flat on a day when I really needed it. I guess nobody's perfect."

Cool atmosphere and decent prices for food and drinks. We ordered 2 carafes of mimosas for only $8 each, which I thought was a great deal. They bring out your champagne and orange juice in separate carafes so you can measure out how much you personally want of each, which I appreciated.   I was not blown away by the food, but everything we ordered was still solid. Two of us ordered the all day breakfast plate that came with eggs, uncured bacon, a slice of toast, and breakfast potatoes. Everything was good, simply nothing stood out. The other two people in our party enjoyed their eggs Benedict and strawberries field salad. Good service and she stayed attentive the whole time we were there catching up. Overall, good experience."

He was able to give great suggestions for food and drinks. We've had the fried mushrooms (featured) and the Reuben egg rolls for appetizers which were both amazing! For entrees we've had the chicken schnitzel, cheesy meatball sub (featured), and the strawberry fields salad which were really tasty. My personal favorite is the chicken schnitzel. Other reviews mention the drinks being so-so but every drink I've gotten has been quality with the alcohol. The hotter melon was recommended by Henry and was very refreshing.

I ordered the Truffled Prosciutto Bruschetta, consisting of creamy truffled ricotta, argula, mission figs and local honey topped by a generous dollop of prosciutto.  It was a dreamy combo of textures and flavors.  On the side I had the seasonal tomato soup, thick and creamy.  My husband was briefly disappointed when Megan reported that the ribs were sold out.  However, she recommended the Wagu steak and frites.  The steak arrived warm and beautifully sliced with a giant side of shoestring fries, delicate and just fried to perfection.  We topped off the meal by splitting a peach crumble adorned with vanilla bean ice cream - a desert to die for."

                "description": "My family rode the North Pole Flyer, not so much for the Santa stuff since we have no children under 10, it was more for family fun. And it was a fantastic experience. The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from.

Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

Super We stayed in the Turquoise Room, which consisted of 2 tables, 8 chairs and two smaller windows. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable...Once the train started the conductor came in to room to announce that there we several open seats in the main car...everyone got up and left leaving the wife and I in peace...Not that we are anti social, but it was peaceful to say the least...Good to catch up with each other, as we both work different hours...Truly not much to see on the way up...but it was a great ride....AC did work, not great but tolerable...I see in other reviews there were issues...You have freedom to roam Car to Car once the train gets rolling...and the train does turn around in Burnet...hard to explain, but it does...and we were able to see the other side of the tracks on the way home...Plenty to see and eat in Burnet...Our Car/cabin also came with free snacks and drinks...which is a great perk..as the snacks in the concession stand were quit expensive...The trip was worth it for us and will do it again next year with the granddaughter.."

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "It's such an adorable idea - volunteers running a historic train line on weekends to give people an authentic experience. But the train is slow - really really slow. The view is simple and unmemorable. The FandB in the first class is simply a cinnamon roll and lemon cake with tea. They do have apples and oranges as well. The trip back was painful - we stood in the concession cart the entire time because the A/Cs didn't work and it was triple-digit hot on a September Saturday. Even my 5-year-old nephew, who is obsessed with trains and knows all there is to know about them, wasn't engaged in this ride much. Thankfully, we had carried board games and our own food so the ride to Burnet was okay but the ride back was really terrible."

                "description": "The most horrible rip off of an experience I have ever had. I bought 4 tickets for the VIP lounge which included treats and drinks and a nicer car, it was none of those things. The food offered were store bought generic cookies and the drinks were either warm apple juice or water. The car lost the A.C. capacity on the return from the small town with nothing to offer and did not even have the gun fight reenactment due to the extreme heat, now imagine that extreme heat inside a metal sardine box. I invited my 72 year old father and I was genuinely worried we would have to rush him to the emergency room upon arrival. I chewed the place out for their false advertisement and putting the elderly and children at risk in the extreme heat without AC.   In summation, do not buy tickets to any of the events this was a horrible experience. I got my money almost a month later, and I will never return and I will warn anyone thinking about ever going to one of these fiascos."

We booked tickets on the Sunset Express trip. The Staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable.   You are able to bring your own drinks (non alcoholic) and snacks which is a plus. They do have a concessions car which is nice.   To us the trip was not as much about the scenery as it was the experience of a mode of travel long since gone."

Just jump off the train, and there you are.  Each train car has it's own characteristics, but take my word, spend the extra money for the air conditioned cars.  We had a chance to walk through the other cars, and even on a beautiful spring day, you can tell a big difference walking into the cars without A/C.  We rode on the City of Chicago, in a table for two, which had great views.  There was complimentary water, tea and snacks on our car.  The volunteer, Barbara, was informative about the train, wildflowers, and announced points of interest on the route."

                "description": "My family and I took a ride on the Hill Country Flyer and this a brief overview of our experience and I recommend you heed this review well.  ----------------------------  I visited and rode the September 7th 10:00 am to 5:00 pm ride to Burnett going out of Cedar Park Wirth the Austin Steam Train Association and I'd like to share my experience that day.   To begin the train left 20 minutes late from the terminal when it was communicated the train would be leaving promptly and on time consistently. Which is fine although it did negatively impact the quality of time spent in Burnett and exploring the town which was a key experience in the advertised outing. Another large disappointment was the lack of the advertised western gun fight. We saw no mention of it, nor display of it. Apparently that was another misrepresentation of the trip. It was advertised we would have two hours to explore downtown Burnett and have lunch. This was barely enough time to visit a local restaurant flooding with business from both local lunchtime and other passengers. With barely an hour in Burnett without enough time to eat we actually had to leave the restaurant we were at in a manic frenzy without eating, apologize to the staff at the restaurant for our rush due to this,and return to the train. Then upon returning at the specified time we still not even begin the process of departing until nearly 30 minutes past the time we were told to return! The. On the return trip we didn't even get above 10 mph on the speed making for a grueling and arduous journey back creating an atmosphere on complete misery on the entire train. On top of all of that the trains expected time to return was 5:00 we did not return until after 5:30! This is insane it officially help derail our entire vacation plan and helped out more of a strain on our time off. Meaning we had to rush and adjust our original plans.   Another issue with the experience was there little to no a/c in rear car named Rippling Stream on a day with temperatures rising above 95 degrees! Although the next car over had perfect a/c with a lower priced ticket. Paying for six tickets @55 dollars to sit in the heat in pool of our own sweat was not the idea of a luxury car provided by marketing materials. We actually had to use the pamphlets provided to make fans in order to be comfortable during the ride and continuously go into the other cars for refuge from the sweltering heat. Upon informing staff of the issue we were told once the train is moving we can go to other cars and stand in the cool air to gain some reprise from the heat.This is insane as we bought out the entire private room to have a bonding family experience we certainly were unable to enjoy. Also this car represented itself as a purchase of an adults only car ticket and children were running through the car. We wanted an experience that would supply with a relaxing adult atmosphere that was negatively impacted by this not being enforced.   Another major concern of mine is lack of communication from staff with the private areas of the train. Announcements regarding safety, departure time, arrival, landmarks etc were unheard in the private room and no effort was made by train personnel to inform us of anything. We were left alone with no information about anything given without having to seek out an attendant regularly. To mention with sound there was also an almost constant excessively loud screeching noise as we moved along at a slugs pace that I feel each passenger will hear in their nightmares of this ride for years to come.   This experience wound up being more stressful due to the previously mentioned circumstances causing our trip to be unenjoyable. Due to the dishonest representation of a truly climate controlled car, and times for departure misrepresented. Unfortunately this is not an outing that we would attended again or recommend to others visiting the Austin/Hill Country area. This is not something we would recommend for anyone trying to relax or enjoy a vacation."

I love that it is in its own section with food trucks outside in case you are hungry. I was lucky enough to have came about an hour before sunset so I was able to enjoy the Austin heat, Sunset, and then nightlife of Radio Coffee and Beer. And just as you would imagine, you can get coffee and Beer. I know that sounds like a stomach ache but I was absolutely fatigued and got a thai tea upon arriving. We didnt plan to stay long and I needed a caffein boost. As I finished my drink, a band was getting ready to set up and the sun was setting and at that point I had all the energy I needed to get a cocktail.   Their beverages and atmosphere is great for an after work happy hour."

They have a back parking lot with the entrance located just north of Radio Coffee, past the small house.    Once inside of their large indoor coffee bar, their baristas will whip up anything within their power, using their house RCB Roasters coffee. From experience, they make a mean macchiato and iced espresso.   Radio Coffee is not just for coffeetotalers, they also serve libations. For weekend mornings - that means mimosas! They will mix up one of their signature Cocktails, with local spirits like a Sotol Silver 'Rita featuring Desert Door and a Paris, TX mixed up with Still Austin Gin. More into wine? They have a small selection of respectable wines that will satisfy an array of palates (2 reds, 2 whites, 1 rose, 1 sparkling-Stella di Notte Prosecco, and 1 Sake). If beer or cider is your jam, you will be pleased with the 14 they have on tap, including appearances from 512, St. Elmo, and Austin Beerworks.   If sitting indoors is not your style, grab your beverage of choice and an outdoor table in their massive kid- and dog-friendly outdoor courtyard with plenty of options for sun or shade and large or small tables.   Hungry? They have three food trucks surrounding their outdoor courtyard including Vera Cruz All Natural and Briscuits. Vera Cruz is always busy. Pro-tip, get there before 9 AM on a weekend, and order your food first to avoid a hangry long wait.   Radio Coffee is that perfect slice of Austin showcasing the best of Austin's relaxed quirkiness, coolness, and eclectic local vibe. So grab an outdoor table and relax while enjoying the Austin ambiance only Radio Coffee can provide."

There's two other lots around the property--don't ask me how to get to them--and on Sunday you can park in front of Tire Man (cool guys, btw).   As soon as you walk onto the premises you realize it's about twice as big as it looks from the street. The coffee aspect was simple but efficient and the food truck selection was perfect for a Sunday morning, biscuits and tacos, what else do you want!  The people watching was great and the everyone I ran into was nice and friendly."

Parking is free if you can find a space, though there wasn't much room by 10AM.   Cashier refused to heat up the almond-buckwheat cake and mushroom-chevre tart I ordered. Understandable since there was a big line, but she didn't even give me a plate. The tart and the cake both turned out to be really tasty even unheated.  Probably a better bar than a coffee shop"

Yes, this place gets busy, especially on weekends. The parking, the wait times, the lines--you should expect it. But I don't see it as a lack of service, it's just because this place is so good! They have tons of space and staff, it's just always full of customers. So prepare yourself for that ahead of time to have a better experience.   Anyway, I love this place. There is tons of outdoor seating with gorgeous trees for shade, a tented area, a covered area, and inside seating as well. There are three different food trucks to choose from, Veracruz being the biggest and most popular. The coffee bar itself is great with lots of drink options, both coffee and alcoholic. They also have some baked goodies!   I've had spotty customer service in the past, but it seems to be a thing of the past! Everyone working the register and bar were super friendly and helpful. Like so kind and made a killer mimosa and dirty chai. So glad to report that!   They got gf/df options, the ambience is great, and the service is sweet--what more can you want for your saturday morning?!"

                "description": "Went here for breakfast and coffee. Really awesome vibes! There was a lot of outdoor seating and they provide water bowls for dogs, so super pet friendly. There were two food trucks open at the time - Briscuit and Veracruz All Natural, but we got Briscuit. As for drinks, my partner got their kombucha on tap and I got a cold brew. Here are our thoughts:  Briscuit - brisket sandwich -- my partner really enjoyed this flavor combination of a buttery biscuit that sandwiches brisket and peach jam. He said it wasn't too greasy and was refreshingly unique take.  Briscuit - tomato, egg and cheese biscuit sandwich  -- I thought the sandwich was very good, but what makes it is the great soft egg scramble and the smoked strawberry jam I ordered on the side. Great option for vegetarians!  Kombucha on tap - my partner says it was refreshing and not as sour as other kombuchas he has had, and recommends it!  Cold brew, black - I thought it wasn't anything special. Definitely had better cold brews in the past that tasted good and had stronger caffeine effects. It tasted kinda watered down.  Ambiance - looks like a great place to just hangout, study and work. Again, love the vibes!"

The back patio area was really nice. we got to enjoy it both before and after the event. it's really well spaced and has good lighting for an outdoor area. I didn't get to try any of the coffee, So I can't testify to that. however, they do have a great tap wall, mostly local, with a lot of variety. I also got to try a couple of the cocktails, and they did a pretty solid job with them.   all in all, a great place for a low key couple of drinks. 4.25/5."

Purchased tic through Eventbrite, pre-ordered some tacos from the Veracruz taco truck (bummed the Cajun and Thai trucks weren't open that evening), and got drinks from the bar.   We checked in, told to find a socially-distanced-table with the number of chairs we needed, then sat back and enjoyed. The music and ambiance were fantastic. Will be back!  Parking was a little crazy, but I think some of the shops next door allow you to park in their lots after hours."

The owners have truly built something special; I love their outside area with the seemingly unlimited amount of seating, fairy lights strung above and just the overall vibe that I get here. The staff are super cool which is always the first thing I take note of, I appreciate when someone has great people skills.   Parking isn't too bad, they have space out front, as well as behind the building. However, on really busy nights, prepare to find street parking.   The drinks? 10/10. I'm really picky when it comes to mixed drinks and the bartenders and Radio Coffee definitely understood the assignment; every drink I've had here tasted amazing and was 100% on point.  It was in the high 90's when we went but luckily there are tons of fans spraying mist everywhere, it was AMAZING.   Honey Made played for a couple of hours on the stage outside and it really tied the experience together nicely for me. Radio Coffee is definitely somewhere I'm excited to visit again."

They also have the indoor option, but limited space and only small group tables.  I tried their coffee and it was good! I didn't try anything at the bar, but it was very busy on a Friday afternoon, lots of people in line for both bar and coffee.  I was a little disappointed that only Veracruz taco truck was open, but I presume that's not radio coffee's decision. I was looking forward to a variety of options from the other 2 food trucks.  I think overall radio coffee and beer is a good vibe for any occasion, such as social, business, study. The parking is limited so just pray that a spot opens up when you arrive!"

The dim-lit bar vibes throwing off a morning coffee buzz or the smell of espresso disorienting for night-time drinkers. Radio sway between both outfits seamlessly. What works for daytime, works for drinking time.  The espresso coffees are great and I love that they do soy milk - a rarity these days.   There's also a few different areas you can get work done or get some downtime. An outside beer garden for sunny days or a cozy indoors spot that's perfect for coffee dates or remote work.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the very good taco truck, Veracruz parked outside. Another operation that can satisfy morning, noon and night."

Their cocktails looked especially tempting in the middle of a run-of-the-mill workday :)  The staff was friendly, efficient with a short line of folks waiting 6-ft. apart, and they had plenty of outdoor seating that accommodated all the recent COVID-19 CDC guidelines. Appreciate them all taking the extra precautions with signs and suggestions for their patrons.  Would definitely come back to visit and enjoy some sun while either working remotely or meeting up with a group of friends! There seemed to be plenty of parking available in the front, but on an more crowded day, I'd recommend a carpool!"

Mix of people hanging out and working, lots of tables to choose from!  The coffee shop itself has a coffee and beer menu, and a few pastries from Easy Tiger, a local restaurant. The beer selection looked awesome!  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I got a decaf americano and it was pretty boring.   I learned after my friend gave up her parking spot in the main lot to me (I had my baby with me) that there's also a secondary lot. So if you don't have luck finding parking in front of the coffee shop, check out the back."

But I know I'm a minority in this.  Playing important games here and there sure!  But when the TVs came, the Music died so much! The table sharing was less.  But you know what? I still feel like I'm \"home\" when I come here. And you can NOT beat the cheese curds!  So stuff your face, play some darts, and enjoy the locals! Because here we are!  Only gripe....

I really like their Trashcan Tuesdays (all Texas canned beers are $3!) to pair with my very own basket of cheese curds, a plate of burger sliders, and some crispy sweet potato fries! Sorry but I don't share my cheese curds when I come here.  Parking can be a thing but do know that there are about a dozen spots reserved for just BSL in the back behind Cindy's (go around back around the corner). There are also a few spots directly in front by the patio area. Otherwise I would suggest ridesharing to BSL if you got a group of folks who you plan on meeting up with.  This is a place where you can bring large groups for sure as there is plenty of space in the game room area AND inside area. I love the bar area too but it can be get crowded with regulars - which isn't a bad thing but something to note.  Service is fast and quick here every time I come even during peak or major game watching. I have never had an issue with being there to meet friends, having my own separate tab, lack of service etc. Only positive experiences here for me which is what keeps me coming back!"

The onion rings are absolutely perfect -- hot and crispy, not greasy-- and it's always worth it to get the full basket. The Chicago Dog is one of my favorites too. I haven't tried the burgers yet, but I can't imagine I'd be disappointed in the least. Very highly recommended!"

                "description": "Not a bad location if you're trying to just go watch a game, chill with friends, or just kick back and let the Austin traffic die down. Lots of TVs so during football season I'm sure it's a full house. The drink choices and food are good, but there are a few minor complaints I have.  There are daily specials on select Texas drafts, cocktails, and other drinks. However, I wish there would be more choices of drafts because it didn't seem like they have any. But I really like the choices I tried, and they even have some others from different breweries. They also have select drinks in cans and bottles.  The food is good, but it wasn't really what I expected. I just had 8 wings to watch a basketball game. The Buffalo medium sauce was excellent, but the lemon pepper dry rub had a little too much of the powder on it, decreasing the integrity of the taste. But I must say the Buffalo sauce and the taste of the chicken wings were pretty good. Maybe a burger or something next time.  I think I'll be back during football for some games, or another time whenever I want to bring a friend. Go try it out and maybe you'll like it. Parking is available in the back by Cindie's, but get there early as spaces run out quick."

                "description": "This is a solid bar with plenty of options.  They have a mildly exhaustive beer selection which will please any palate, discerning or otherwise.  I plan to visit more and scroll through the list of options again.  There's also a number of daily food and drink specials and I believe there is a happy hour offered as well.  I typically come to here to watch [European] football  (soccer) with a cold beer and standard American bar fare.  My one gripe is that they have a pretty good burger that they just don't know how to cook at medium temperature. I've ordered it twice and reiterated that I'd like it medium and it comes out well done each time.  That's mad annoying but I'm still holding out faith that they'll get it right one day. The fries are pretty top notch.  Again, you can't loose coming here just on the strength of the beer selection alone.  I'll be back for a better burger experience soon."

The porch is chill and dog friendly though, so there's that. If you've got tons of time and don't mind being ignored and overlooked, it's worth a look. That said, you'd likely being doing yourself a favor by going to either ABGB or Loro, both of which are within walking distance."

I also appreciate the large number of TVS and the staff's ability to switch one to the game you'd like to see. During football season it can be hard to find a bar playing anything other than the Texas games, which makes sense but can be frustrating. Luckily Black Sheep has so many TVs and the set-up to accommodate many guests with multiple interests!"

They have 2 spaces in the front and parking that is not theirs that even the wait staff says is only available from certain hours. The second issue: on this occasion my experience with my waitress was not the best. Didn't get seen/attended to for about 5 minutes. Then it took forever to close my tab/close out due to her not even acknowledging my table. She would go sit and mingle with other tables. (And they weren't even that busy)   Over all, the wait staff could've been a lot better. And the establishment itself should do something about their shitty parking situation. Nobody wants to pay $100 to get their car unbooted because of the lack of parking."

Not sure if this is the standard but when we got there about half the tables were reserved for people who come to trivia each week. I get honoring loyalty, but this was a big turnoff for newcomers or people visiting Austin.   The biggest perk of this place is the ability to order off the Alamo full food menu for the chocolate chip cookies or bottomless popcorn. Otherwise, it's nothing you couldn't miss for another nearby bar. Perhaps I just hit people on an off night, but that's my opinion."

We had to figure out whether to seat ourselves or wait, by asking.  No eye contact from either waiter/waitress.  Annoyed the waitress told us to sit anywhere and someone will be with us. We sat at a dirty table didn't see a better option.  After 5 minutes we were approached but after a hufff and a puff the fat winded waiter walked off without saying a word then came back with a towel and aggressively began to wipe the table.

We had about half an hour to spare and lucky for us, got to partake in the happy hour specials. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4-7 and all day on Sunday's.  They have a Mexican inspired menu so there are a lot of tequila drinks (they even do flights) as well as dishes like queso con chorizo and grilled elotes which are corn on the cob with mayo, queso cotija, lime, and chili.   We had tickets to what they call a 'feast', where dinner is included with the movie, so we only wanted drinks. They have a lot of fun ones here and one called the Love Bug caught my eye which I think was made with sparkling wine, strawberry, lemon, and honey? I can't remember but I do know it was like $9. Gut punch!  I instead went with the more pocket friendly option of the happy hour Austin Eastciders Original Cider for $5. I'd never tried it before and it was really good!  My husband got a Karbach Sympathy for the lager for $3 which he also enjoyed.   The inside is small but there are both sit down and stand at tables, as well as bar seating. They also have games you can borrow and play while you are there which I think is awesome. And bonus! If you haven't finished your drink by the time your theater opens, they are cool with you taking it in there."

We've been Alamo Drafthouse fans for 20+ years so I really want to love and appreciate this location -- but the food is awful and the service at 400 Rabbits is unpredictable. It hasn't always been that way. But the last year or so, I've met friends on several occasions for drinks and snacks. Chewy nuts, flat drinks. My last visit was the final straw: I couldn't even get a glass of water and the two dishes we ordered were terrible. Chili fries and pumpkin dip. Overly complicated food ideas and poorly executed. The pumpkin dip was bland and unappetizing. The fries were almost inedible but it came with a dip that made them bearable.  Please managers, fix this place. We love having an Alamo in 78739. We don't want some chain to come in and sweep us off our feet. But it wouldn't take much."

There is outdoor seating with patio furniture and fancy cocktails inside. Kyle helped us, and was very helpful when we were choosing beverages. The prices are a little high, but we also got the specialty cocktails and not my usual beer."

                "description": "400 Rabbits Bar lives up to it's name serving an impressive list of Mezcal and tequila.  The decor is swanky with black plush booths lining the wall, black walls with gold accents and dimly lit (well, at least after sunset).  The place is pretty small but there is some room for patrons to stand.  The menu items are on the expensive side. We ordered the senoran hot dog which is bacon wrapped dog, grilled with green Chile salsa, beans, pickled onions, jicama, tomato, cilantro mayo, cotija cheese on a bolilo bun. The bacon could have been crisper but overall I enjoyed the flavors of chilies and cilantro mayo but in my opinion not worth $9. The senoran dog was served with a generous portion of chips with delicious warm salsa.  The draw here is the Mezcal and tequila which can be purchased by itself or as flights with a small glass of I believe sangrita or tomato juice.  Note that the Mezcal flight is $30 and consists of 3 - 3/4 ounce servings.  When I consume tequila or Mezcal, my evil twin tends to make an appearance. And no one likes her, I promise. With that said I tried one of their specialty cocktails, the Lester Burnham. This light refreshing drink is definitely an acquired taste. It consists of gin, San Pelegrino Limonita, rose water, prosecco and candied rose petals. Jesse ordered the Manhattan. Although the drinks were pricey they were STRONG making it justifiable.  After a couple drinks here you will leave a drunken rabbit.  Besides the drinks we enjoyed, they have an extensive specialty cocktail list along with beer and wine.   I would definitely grab a drink here before/after watching a movie at this Alamo but I will likely skip the food next time."

                "description": "Never reviewed? Oops! I'm a fan! [Note I have only been here before or after a movie, never as a standalone destination]  When I come to Alamo Slaughter I will often hang for a beverage here before, during (see below!), or after the movie. The cocktails are excellent! They do classics like a Moscow Mule or Corpse Reviver, have a variety of margaritas (on the rocks, no frozen mix here), and their signature cocktails - all crafted from tequila or mezcal - are something special. Examples:  LA MANZANA DE FUMAR - Reposado mezcal, apple liquer, tamarind-arbol chile syrup.  PASADO DE MODA - Silver tequila, mezcal, honey, mole bitters, orange peel  Goodness. The cocktails aren't cheap (all about $8-10), but these b-tenders know what they are doing and these tasty bevies pack a punch. (Admission: first time I've ever used b-tender in a sentence, not sure if I can get away with it. But I just saw that hysterical episode of Parks and Rec where John Ralfio says- wait, I'll just post the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5uoNFQEotQ Hysterical.)  They also have some Mexican munchies like chili lime \"cerveza nuts\" and tostadas with grilled shrimp (and it seems like the menu is different each time?)  I ahve only enjoyed food once (a brunch item) but am always tempted.   The bar itself is a bit dim and dark, so during the day all that dark leather seems weird to me, but it's perfect if you are on a date.  Best part about this place: If you are running late or just don't feel like swinging by, you can order anything they have from inside the Alamo theater! Yup, this means you can choose from all the Alamo goodies AND the 400 Rabbits menu!"

They have multitude of whiskeys and beers to pick from.  Plus the outdoor seating and dog friendly atmosphere make this a chill spot for mingling with friends or soaking in the awesomeness of the state capital of Texas.  They also sell awesome shirts.  Sadly the Excite Bike shirt I saw the bartender rocking wasn't available so I settled for the blue shirt.  Please get more of those in!  The Wheel, keep on spinning!"

Came today to have a celebratory vaccine cocktail. It looks like they used to have a $4 whisky of the day... well, it's now $5 but the winning bet is to make it as a cocktail for $8. An $8 old fashioned? Can't say I'm mad about that. Jenny behind the bar was super friendly and I gotta say it's nice to sit at an actual bar again."

The bartenders are cool folks with lots of great knowledge. The music isn't too loud - a good volume for talking but still bumping :-)  Unfortunately though... its quite expensive, and the staff isn't super transparent about the pricing. For instance, the whiskey of the day is supposed to be $5. I got it with ice, and was charged an extra dollar. This might be trivial, but it sucks getting charged without warning, especially for something that shouldn't get an upcharge (even if the on-the-rocks pour is slightly more liquid)... kinda like getting charged for napkins. And in general, everything's pretty pricey for a neighborhood bar.  I guess I'm a little too old school for all the new hotness in Austin. But I don't see any reason to visit The Wheel when you have so many other places that are both inexpensive and cool."

No TV, limited beer selection that runs out quickly (both IPA kegs tapped out on a random Tuesday night), and no food.  You come here to let the night get away from you and order some strong cocktails.  Lots of outdoor space is cool and bring your own food is actually a plus in my book.  Beer selection 8 on draft, but good prices at $7/ish per big pour.  Everyone is nice and vibe seems 20s-30s clientele. I liked the Wheel for what it is, a good starting point nearby my apartment to begin a drinking night."

The bartenders are extremely friendly and seemed genuinely interested in conversation beyond just your tip.   They definitely specialize in cocktails so I would probably look elsewhere if you are looking for a nice draft or bottle of Shiner. I had 2 different specialty cocktails, both of which were good but definitely on the pricier side ($10-$15 each).   They have a large patio space for meeting up with friends and the indoor bar is intimate enough to make it a decent  first date spot worth checking out."

The indoor area is intimate, dimly lit, and has a sort of prohibition-era bar feel with its tin ceiling, newspaper clipping wallpaper, and red lighting. Outside, you'll find a large patio with lots tables, and a great fountain made from beer taps. The drinks... well, my beer was way too expensive for what it was (a fairly generic IPA), and their selection for beers was limited (on draft: 8 taps, 1 IPA). HOWEVER, I know that's mainly due to the fact that The Wheel's specialty is whiskey. If whiskey's your drink of choice, I'm sure you'll love it here. They have $4 daily specials, and a number of specialty cocktails.  I'm glad I gave it a shot, and I'll definitely recommend it to my whiskey drinking friends, but if you're looking for anything besides whiskey (or maybe a nice cocktail) I'd steer you elsewhere."

I forgot pics, bit there's a dedicated dog area, not just at the seating just outside the front door but also across the parking lot with lots of shade, picnic tables, and a water station.  Our server, Luis, made our experience the best as he was willing to serve us across the way under the trees since things were slow.  His recommendation for salad dressing was cool too as we mixed 2 on our Southwest salad and that was awesome (cilantro and chipotle I think).  All in all, the pizza was good, and there is a dedicated brunch menu, which was unexpected as well.  We'll be back another time to try more things beyond pizza and to take pics."

The Zilker Love pizza had become its own food group in our home, and there are many vegetarian delights to delight, as well as craft beer and a fabulous brunch! The staff is thoughtful and diners tend to be very pleasant as well!  If you see Miss Sophia while visiting, please drop by and say hello!"

Plenty of unique pizzas and burgers, Austin Terrier focuses on new American taste, mixed with the old.   Vegans rejoice, as there is a pizza and burger for you. The Greenbelt Pizza (sub for vegan cheese) and the Impossible Burger are going to be your go-tos. What makes the Greenbelt Pizza great is the truffle oil, the fresh and plentiful arugula, topped with red onions and mushrooms.  Add the Trio of Fries (sub the truffle parm fries), and you have a perfect meal for two."

I had a pretty delicious sandwich with Brie and apples, and my boyfriend had a pizza.  The crust on the pizza was perfect and probably one of the best crusts I've had on a pizza in a long time.  My sandwich was just okay....I definitely ordered wrong.  I would love to go back and try some of their other menu items and enjoy a beverage from their extensive menu."

Our go to's are the Diablo burger (spicy) and green belt pizza (delicious) ... swap the cheese for goat and request both to be gluten free. PLUS they were quick to accommodate for my child's allergies. The server went to the back and snapped a photo of what goes into their crust/bun so that we didn't expose her to any tree nuts. We love this place so much!"

Went last night with my doggo to meet a friend with her doggo, and we had the funnest and best waiter named Chad! I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was phenomenal. We also got a platter of 3 diff kinds of fries that were accidentally ordered for us and he told us to keep them lol. Then he covered our drinks for us because of a long wait time that wasn't even a long wait time! The dogs all played and got treats and tons of love from the staff. My enormous Bulldog couldn't get back into my car at the end because he was tired and my fiancé wasn't there to help me so Chad helped me lift him into my car lol. Anyways this place is awesome! 5/5 recommend!"

Lots of beer, the TVs aren't loud, and cute Terrier art is on the walls. Dogs are welcome in the outside seating area.  There are a few vegetarian options, and I'm pretty sure they can be made vegan.  After coming here several times, I have to suggest ordering the Trio of Fries. Three different seasonings and three sauces let's you try a variety of flavors and fill up on carbs. That's absolutely my jam. It's great for sharing with 2-3 more people and gotta really well with a sandwich. The Toro is pretty good. It tastes fresh and is really satisfying."

The menu had some fun interesting choices.  The waiter was friendly and accommodating.  We ordered and boy were we surprised.  We LOVED every bite.  This was 3 days ago and my daughter is asking for us to go back as the pizza was SO good.    My turkey burger was full of flavor thanks to the grilled apples and brie - hint - sub out the pesto mayo and bacon for garlic mayo and avocado.  Gadzooks my mouth is watering at the thought.   My husband's burger was perfectly cooked.  Bacon and fried egg on a burger? Yes please!  A 5 star win for all of us.  We will see you again soon Austin Terrier folks, thank you!"

We sat outside on a cool February Saturday. They had heaters, but not enough to keep us warm.  We still enjoyed our food and our dogs enjoyed the free treats.  The table started with the  trio of fries. The sweet potato fries were the best of the three.  I had the zilker pizza with the wheat crust. It wasn't crispy, but it was tasty. The crust was pretty flavorful too. The pizza was big enough to share with one other person and we even had a slice left over.  Parking was easy and the service was good."

Especially since it's right down the street.  So i ordered a Diablo Burger which was soooo good.  My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey at $11 (since it doesn't include fries), but i will definitely order more from there as a treat!  Btw, if the online ordering isn't working, just call them and they'll take your payment over the phone so you can do a contactless pickup."

Props to the bartenders for making legitimate lemon drops instead of hating us for ordering them.  They had bar service, and line was never longer than 3 people or crowded. We didn't have to wait for a table at all when we arrived. We sat in a table nestled in the trees and although I saw reviews that complained about the birds, the trees were a nice back rest, and the social distancing was comforting! It's definitely not a fancy or experience-based spot, but it has a time and place!   Pro tip: If you get stuck on the wrong side of the really long fence in the street, one of the panels to the right of the entrance is unattached and you can step through!!"

                "description": "We visited Yellow Jacket Social Club for an after work cocktail and they did not disappoint. From the guy at the door to the bartender, everyone was super kind and helpful. We ended up ordering the watermelon frozen margaritas - I could be wrong but I think they change up their frozen cocktails quite often. If you come across it on your visit, I would definitely recommend it. They had a variety of beer options and even though I didn't order any food, their menu looked appetizing.  They have a cool vibe with an expansive patio setup. If you get the choice between small/large cocktail, get the large. The price comparison is $7/10 and the large seemed like a way better deal. The birds above can be a little bit of a nuisance so try and sit somewhere with less tree above. They were also very Covid safe and instead of having everyone order in the bar, they had a makeshift bar setup outside where you would place your order. I recommend grabbing a patio seat here on a beautiful day!"

                "description": "I came here for happy hour, based on a local's recommendations. There really weren't any deals but the drinks were considerably priced. Bartender was alright but the staff overall and vibe of the place were not as hospitable as other places nearby. The inside is small with a five bar feel, which I'm fine with, the outside area is probably nice on days where it isn't raining but I sat out there during cloud cover and it was just alright. The parking lot gets flooded after rain so take that into consideration, The bright spot of this place was their potato wedges. Not even kidding. They aren't your typical wedges and I was delighted at how good they were. I'd return just for the those, to be honest. If you want no frills and to keep entirely to yourself, this is probably your place. Social butterflied would be best served somewhere else."

We told Christina, our hostess it's either gonna be this number or this number, not sure if it goes up or down but it's out of two choices.  She gave us a blank stare and then walked us over to the tables like a teacher giving us a tour for a field trip. Once she figured out our table she proceeded to take our order. My friend ordered first and left to the table. Then I asked her what on the menu has beets because my friend loves beets and she just stared at me and said look at the menu.

Their burger, covered in camembert or brie, carmelized onions and whole grain mustard is so delicious!! Pair it with crispy Pomme frites and homemade aioli...it's a mic drop moment. The staff is kind and helpful, their craft beer choices and a small but wonderful wine list just rounded out the afternoon. All they have left to do is claim their yelp listing! LOL  But seriously, if you are a foodie, this should definitely be on your list of places to frequent. I'm sure they have many other amazing things to eat there, but their burger is so good that we've never ordered anything else!"

                "description": "First visit, so my assessment change over time. My initial sense is that while the food is good, the service needs some work.   No complaints about the food, which was quite good, such as the Heirloom Tomato Tarte and the Salade Niçoise.  The ratatouille could've used a bit more bread, and I thought the toffee flavor of the mango gelato-bread pudding dessert we got to be overpowering.  Drinks were varied and interesting, with French component takes on standard cocktails (e.g. \"The Vielle Fashioned\") that worked for some (their variation of the French 75) and  less so for others (I believe the Frontera Sidecar).  What definitely fell short was the service. I don't need overly attentive service, but it's not reasonable to be out of water for half an hour, unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waiter time after time.  This is particularly a problem given the small size of their water glasses and the lack of a water bottle for the table. Fixing this relatively small problem would be huge."

If you're outside you have to get your food and drinks by going back inside by the bar to put your order. To our surprise, the cocktails didn't have actual liquor which was strange. The boards they brought out after a good hour after ordering along with the fries were a bit lackluster.

Hopfields was #5! #5 guys and not to be snooty but I didn't even look at anything past P Terry's which was around #15! Hehehe P Terry's is good (it's a local chain, made to order) but it's a drive thru and I was looking for more of an \"elevated\" experience tonight! No shade to my P Terry lovers!! So the Paschal Burger is $16 Medium rare, and slathered in ooey gooey camembert cheese and mustard! I enjoyed it! I regularly lean toward a sweet burger with carmelized onion (which were included), BBQ sauce, bacon jam and other ingredients like these. This burger is just savory not too bold and a textural delight! See the video for the \"unboxing\"! I would give it a solid 7/10."

I suppose you pay extra for the upscale vibe of the place.  This is not saying that the food is bad, in fact it is very good. The wine and beer options are the best in the area, now that Vino Vino is closed. The great thing is that you can go there for drinks, without ordering food, and have a great time sitting indoors or outside. The staff are very professional, welcoming, and they use their knowledge about the different wines to make suggestions."

It was pretty empty and easy to get a table, so we sat in the middle room of the place, which was somewhat of a makeshift library/lounge with old foreign decor.  We got olives and almonds to start, with escargot, which came with small lettuce leaves and was in a red sauce (not your typical garlic butter). It was really good, different and interesting to try it in a different preparation. For the main, we split the steak and frites. It was probably the smallest portion of steak I've ever seen and if I had eaten it myself I probably still would have been hungry. But, it was really nicely cooked and seasoned, as well as the fries. So despite the size it was super good.  Don't know if I'd come again, also because they only had some special cocktails and not a full bar, but it was interesting to try the place."

They are made with sherry and fortified wines. I got one with grapefruit and absolutely LOVED it. It was so creative and delicious. That being said, they do not serve hard alcohol. As for the food, we go the Mushroom Leek Tarte, Moules Frites, and Pascal Burger. We loved them all! The tarte was flaky and perfect and the burger delicious. I wasn't super wild about the fries and a with I had subbed them for a side salad, but I guess I will know for next time! The modules frites were great, but also had quite the kick, so don't order unless you like spicy food.  Overall, the atmosphere with the outdoor patio was phenomenal and the food was superb!

I'll definitely go back and try those. The fries were heavenly. Like crisp, perfect thickness, and that garlic aioli though!! They had a wide array of beers, and I enjoyed their wheat, IPA and belgian options. There was something for everyone...cocktails, wine--you name it! They also serve tap water too.  I was torn between the ratatouille and veggie burger. The mussel frites were the star of the table. My friend said her pascal burger was alright. It could have been more of a medium rare instead of a medium, but it definitely wasn't the \"best burger\" she'd had. I enjoyed the ratatouille. They give extra bread upon request--there's no way I was going to soak up all of the yummy juices of that flavorful ratatouille dish without BREAD! The food server was very friendly too. We didn't catch his name, but he was very knowledgeable when we asked him what was in the white aioli that came with our fries.   In all, the experience is wonderful for good friends, dates and even family dinners. The place is dimly lit, sooooo those of y'all needing glasses might need to turn on that cell phone light. Super romantic place, without the expectations to dress up or present yourself a certain way. Score! Definitely a rockstar spot."

This little gem is sandwiched behind Mi Madre's and El Chilito. You'll miss it if you blink! Swing around back for parking or walk up from the front.   Indoor/outdoor seating with puppers welcomed outside.   + Tasty noms (get the fried deviled eggs. Woo!) Classy cocktails Very relaxed vibe Minimal staff contact  Safety measures in place Cute little floating books  Clean bathroom  - This place is smaller, dont bring a big group.  No cash, yall. Its dirty, ya know? Small parking outback   I took my cousin and we had a really nice time. The staff and bartenders were incredibly kind and went above and beyond to be helpful.   Definitely check this place out with a friend or two...or a pupper or two."

A mess. Drinks are basic and uninteresting. If you want a decent site to sit and chat with your friends, it's a good place to hang, but you can find the same atmosphere elsewhere and get palatable food and better cocktails."

Otherwise, expect to pay minimum $14 for your main course. I love that their menu, decor and the restaurant reminds me of an elementary school.   Service was wonderful and food came out about 15 mins on a slow day. It's also conveniently located between a couple of taco restaurants if you need a quick snack!   Patio is Bob and dog friendly! There's water bowls for your thirsty pup on the side of the restaurant if you choose to bring your furry companion!   Bartender made me a cute mimosa to enjoy before heading back to the airport. Definitely coming back to visit when I'm in town again!"

                "description": "Visited for happy hour and wasn't smitten with any dish (except the mac 'n cheese). Everything was fine; just nothing that makes me want to return again any time soon.  I love the indoor seating with its broody, dark interiors and the plentiful outdoor seating on park benches (hard to get in and out of if you're wearing a skirt/dress!) and when the sunset is that beautiful magenta/hot Texas orange color, this venue is perfectly situated to stare longingly at it. I also like that you order from the counter instead of traditional table service because sometimes it's nice not to be interrupted (make sure you have everything you need before you sit down, though, because if the line is long, it makes it difficult to track someone down for something).  A solid place for a drink if you're a sunset chaser."

                "description": "Solid neighborhood bar, but i probably wouldn't come if i didnt live near by.   The best feature is the patio, Manor road is a cool neighborhood and its fun to people watch. The inside feels a little cramped for a group and it can be pretty loud. The neighborhood in general is nice. If your in the area you should stop by.  They also have some good happy hour deals. 6 dollar fish and chips and 5 dollars off bottles of wine. Each day of the week has a different deal and they're all pretty good.  In terms of drinks, they have a decent selection of beers on tap. Theyre selection extends beyond the basic austin starter pack too which is nice.  In terms of food,  Its a step up from bar food, but i definitely wouldn't call this a gastro pub. The fish and chips are good but definitely greasy and the portions are inconsistent.    The burger is pretty good. The patty is pretty thick and they put a jam on top thats sweet which stole the show. I think the jam was made of onions. I only wish they put more jam on top. It has a similar effect as ketchup. be warned, the saten burger is a little tough."

The only parking available is street parking behind the bar in the neighborhood, but you don't have to walk too far. (Less than 5 min)  This bar has a throwback school vibe with chalkboards on the walls and mini composition notebooks for your receipt. They have a good craft beer selection and their food is delicious and higher quality than your average bar food. We ordered the wings and pretzels. The pretzels are a bit more oily, however it being bar food, filled my greasy food craving. The mustard seed it came with was a great pair (although i highly recommend adding a queso dip!). The wings were delicious as well and were mild spicy. There is patio seating out back and picnic tables out front, as well, so there is plenty of space for a group."

Think it was worth it.   While small the space was great and the food and drinks on point. Loved the smokey blood Mary. Got the potato hash vegan style and it was tasty.   Only thing that was a miss was the way they handled the crowd. Couldn't order food and drink until after a time past open which isn't their fault but there wasn't enough staff to handle the crowd. Food went to wrong people and no one to check on diners.  They did the best they could but poor planning.   Will give them another go on a normal day and think things will be five star worthy."

                "description": "I had been meaning to check this place out as it is literally down the street from a friend's apt on Manor and having investigated almost every other place on the block, my FOMO was kicking in when I would see this place packed to the hilt every time we drove by. Luckily, I came on a quiet weekday evening and barely made it for their HH (the bartender was nice enough to honor it since it was but a minute over).   I like the vibe here, it is very trendy eastside but w/o the pretension or self-importance of other places nearby.   I had my sights set on the Montreal fries as I am a poutine enthusiast (and purist, to be truthful) , so I will establish right now these are not traditional poutine, but a conceptualization. First off, the serving was massive and I probably reached my sodium quota for the week by finishing every last bite, but I'm not a quitter and setting this heap of short ribs, gravy, cheese curds, and fries in front of me was instantly \"Challenge: Accepted!\". It took me almost an hour and a half whittling away one bite at a time and having to take literal breathers in between, but it was ::MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:: (in the unironic non-Bush sense) and I had 0 regrets.  In the 90mins of unleashing my hardcore Fatty for all to see, I got to interact w/the staff and other patrons and I have to say, there were no judgements (aamof, I got several nods and eyebrow raises of approval at my endeavor). I'll admit, everyone I encountered was a very Austin-y version of splendid! We laughed, I cried (when I finally finished the Montreal Fries), and even rebuked the very handsome bartender's insinuation I would even think about a to-go box!   All in all, I enjoyed my visit here and can see myself coming back on an off/quiet night. The seating inside is pretty cozy and the patio is smallish as well, so I can only imagine how chummy you have to get with your fellow \"students\" when the Friday bell sounds and weekend recess is in effect!"

Went ahead and sampled some beers, grabbed a Dogfish Punkin Ale - they guy even threw some sugar and freshly ground cinnamon on the rim! This is the only way you should be drinking a pumpkin beer!   Ordered the fish and chips - $5 bucks on HH! These things came with some serious garlic fries.. I want you to take what you think is a lot of garlic, then multiply it by 83874... Somehow still delicious, the tarter sauce on the side deserves an award.. It was like a tarter/greek tzatziki sauce hybrid! I should have asked for some to-go. No idea why they give you ketchup as well.. Doesn't really fit the plate because of the fry seasonings and garlic. The fish was tender and crispy... perfect balance.   If you haven't had a chance to check this spot out, throw it on your list!  One last thing - if you do order the fish and chips.. Don't go get your game on for the night without brushing and gargling a gallon of mouthwash, throw some gum in for good measure! Be responsible, people!"

Monday, all full sized pints (not the high ABV offerings) are $4, which is great. The food is really good as well.   We tried the wontons which were good, though there were only 3 in a $10 order. The kale salad included was fantastic.  We also got the special for the day which was a tempura scallion pancake filled with Korean beef. Really a fantastic little dish. This one impressed me.  We also got the fish and chips. the fish was of high quality and the fries were tasty. Two small gripes, it was fish and frites (though the crispy fries were delicious), and while the outside of the fish was perfectly crispy, the inside of the batter was a touch soggy. The goat cheese tartar was unlike anything I've had before: subtle in flavor and with the consistency of butter. However, when you spread it on the fish and it starts to melt, it was really good.  So, a couple of small gripes about the food can't keep this from being a 5-star. Every time I visit, I am reminded of what a good gastropub can be."

The aesthetic in the place is really light and fun, and they have a lot of outdoor seating area. There were a lot of people doing work/homework of some kind, it is definitely a place where you can come and chill for a while. There was a large selection of drinks, including some seasonal options. I decided to get an iced Americano which I thought had a good flavor. Drinks were to us pretty quickly, and there was a water station four easy water access. The cream and sugar area also had almond milk, which I thought was a nice addition. Most places usually only have half and half, so a non-dairy alternative was nice to see. They sell beer, however I didn't look at the beer selection so I'm no help on that! Worth checking out, I plan to go back soon!"

This is an excellent example of a business making an effort to seamlessly live in its environment-- in other words, this coffee shop found a way to complement its outside surroundings near the Tesla factory, and almost gives off a steam punk vibe. I'm a pretty sunny person, but even I can't resist. Also, the drinks are actually good. Very glad that they were able to have an aesthetic look and comfy vibe without sacrificing the quality and taste of their drinks. I got the matcha latte with oat, vanilla, and turmeric !"

                "description": "Spokesman is everything I want and more. I worry to yell too loudly about how great they are because then everyone will know and make them busy all of the time. On the one hand that's great for business, on the other I want to keep them all for myself.   A lot of coffee shops can be snooty and pretentious, but this ain't that. Everyone there truly loves coffee and people. They just want everyone to be caffeinated and happy. What better a mission than that?  They roast their own beans which means you're getting a truly unique cup when you go there. All of their espresso pulls are doubles to start. That's why I love getting the 1:1 when I go to sit down. You get a single shot of espresso and a baby latte with the other single shot inside. You also get a glass of sparkling water and a Hershey kiss. Total perfection. This lets you explore and taste the espresso on its own and then see it in a drink with the milk. It's an awesome way to discover what you might like or not like about a particular roast.   Then on your way out if you liked it you can buy a bag of those beans to take home for your coffee there for the week. It's the best."

They've got compostable take away cups and utensils, which is so rare. Their tea comes loose leaf in a steal strainer, and all their food is severed on reusable plates and in mugs.  I got the Turkish tea, flavorful and now one of my favorites. I'm not sure if this is a house mix, but the tea tasted unique and strong. Unlimited hot water refills, just go up to the bar area and ask! With tea I got the tasty morning bun, kind of like a cinnamon roll but with different nuts and really big. Flakey croissant exterior with a goo-y interior, this was a really nice cafe treat!  I think tourists and locals both enjoy the distinctive graffiti art on the walls of this cafe. It's located in a shipping container area that has a nice outdoor seating place too."

Granted, I thought the navigation was taking me somewhere very odd as Spokesman is a bit off the beaten path and was a bit harder to find in the dark. But it's worth it. I was greeted by a friendly staff and an interesting menu. The beer was fantastic and I got a cold brew coffee to go for the next morning.    For food, I'd suggest the chicken salad sandwich. It was delicious! However, the bread is toasted a bit too much--so crunchy it hurt my mouth a bit. But overall, crisp and fresh flavors that left me wanting more. I'd order it again, just asking that the bread not be so hard."

Actually go next-door and then to their backyard and then go up and you are at the spot. It's very small it's almost gives you a speakeasy feel. The bartenders were super cool and we really enjoyed our time there. It was a group of seven of us and we took up most of the bar. Drinks are very good as well. If you're not a tequila fan this is not for you but you should still try to experience it at least once. They have frozen on the rocks and other delicious cocktails."

I have been driving by Techo everyday for years, and we frequent the area for the other restaurants and bars, but for some dumb reason beyond comprehension, we never gave them a try. We are completely hooked now! The space is cozy, intimate, and inviting. The drinks are just out of this world, and SO strong! The flavors are unique, and even if you aren't a mezcal fan, some of the drinks completely cover up what's even in it! They had a cool nook tucked away next to the bar that we are hoping to sit in once things open back some more, and we would love to hang out inside and enjoy their cool vibe inside! The patio is tucked away upstairs, and even though it's in a busy area right along the street, you don't even notice! They have TONS of misting fans outside that made the 102 degree heat totally tolerable for once!   They had dog bowls out, so I would venture to say they are dog friendly, which we plan to take advantage of very soon!"

But they have my favorite margarita in town, incredible ambiance and authentic tasting experiences - that you just have to KNOW about it. This is the first bar I bring visitors too - usually right when they open, so we can snag seats at the bar and get guided Mezcal tastings from Techo's very knowledgeable and easygoing staff. I never leave without ordering at least one of their Frozen Guava Agave Margaritas with the chili salt rim (do NOT pass on the home-made chili salt, it is the perfect pair for this sweet/tart drink).  Every one of my girlfriends love that drink! My boyfriend also loves that he can get a strong mezcal centered cocktail from their list (which has 10-12 house cocktails that are great). Their Micheladas are also a crowd fave.   When you start to get hungry - walk to Salty Sow for happy hour apps or down to Patrizi's to share some crazy good home-made Italian food from a food truck! You'll have a line at Patrizi's - but it's a great option for your visiting friends, who have probably never had an Italian food truck experience."

Tried my first mezcal margarita there and have a new favorite cocktail (normally prefer an old fashioned).   Fried crickets are a nice add on as well.   Will definitely go back. A date might be more impressed by this than another random brewery!"

                "description": "Techo Mezcaleria reminds me of why I still love Austin: the unusual, hidden gems that are tucked away all around the city.  Most other folks already hit the highlights. It's tiny, seats maybe 10, and you enter through the Schoolhouse Pub gate, despite Techo actually being on the second story of Mi Madres. Word of caution: Mezcal ranges from \"lightly smoky\" to \"I'm drinking liquid smoke.\" Personally it's not something I can have a lot of, we had three sample sized shots and that was plenty between the two of us. Just be forewarned.   Our bartender Ian was awesome, we had a nice, rambling forty minute conversation about mezcal versus tequila versus whisky. Unfortunately, we went on a Saturday when there wasn't a happy hour, so we didn't get a chance to sample the margaritas, but that gives us a great excuse to go back."

I feel everyone gave him the \"just a dumb drunk pass\" but the more I think about it the more I think if he was drunk like that maybe he shouldn't have been served anymore or asked to leave. Also this was around 6-8pm not your average time for people to be so belligerent. Drink pictured is the violeta."

They have a good sized drink menu and also offer frozen drinks, which is always a fun addition.   They have a fantastic selection of Mezcal and Tequila and it's a fantastic spot for a date because they have a few nooks inside great for a few to sit. The ambience is also very romantic-very dim inside with lots and lots of candles everywhere. The place itself is upstairs of SchoolHouse (there are stairs outside to the right of the restaurant). It is pretty small, only seating maybe 20 inside and about the same outside.   However, worst case scenario if you arrive and they're packed you can head downstairs to SchoolHouse for a drink!  This is a must visit and will impress others when you introduce them to a what-feels-like hidden gem."

Great draft selection, in fact an OUTSTANDING draft selection.  They even have some bottled selection too. I really like that they don't carry the Milwaukee or St Louis brands and are all craft.  My only criticism would be that beer shouldn't be served in a small (almost) wine glass at $9/beer. That's just too rich that it limits me to one.  If it were a pint the value would be better. Four Stars instead of Five."

I popped by this place for a beer and found it interesting that I previously and unknowingly walked right past when meeting friends at the TexMex joint next door.  Service here was great during the day - when I stopped in. I presume the guy running the bar was the owner but didn't get into a convo about that. He appeared to have moved from San Francisco a few years back from what I gathered and he was very beer knowledgeable which made for my sour selection.  We spoke of some other sours in the area and such. He was a genuine guy having a genuine conversation. That small chatter right there made me feel like I could call this a regular watering hole in a town usually piled high with trendy pop-ups.  He celebrated 3 yrs just recently and I can see why he's still here. It reminds me of a small establishment I visited in Brussels last year right adjacent to Mannekin Pils (the famous peeing baby statue for those unaware). It had a sense of community and Mort Subite also has that. Maybe it's a Belgium thing but I felt like I was right back there when I sat here.  I really enjoyed myself here and although I had but one drink (i was doing my own beer exploration day), I will be back."

Like all bars, the bartenders set the standard and, hence, the five star review. Anthony and Piper are a great team and are professional, warm and inviting with customers. The draft beer selection is exceptional and you'd be hard pressed to find an equal rival in the city. Directly across the street from Elephant Room on Congress and 3rd, you get a great mix of residents and tourists, alike. There's outdoor seating both in the front and back (including a solid American fare trailer in the back -- good philly cheesesteak). But I digress, it's all about the ambiance, beer and good people at Mort's."

They had 2 of our favorites, 1 of which is incredibly hard to find in Austin, La Trappe. I do appreciate the beers in the proper glass. The front patio gives nice European vibes. However, the service is horrible. I wish I had gotten her name, tall thin woman, medium length blonde hair. Very rude and short with our group, the birthday boy with us had questions and she wasn't happy to help. She told him to stop talking in the middle of their conversation. Then when we went to close our tab the bill was $135 for 4 beers. Four beers, by the glass. Now some of the beers are pricier than others since they're imported but we were aware of that as the prices are listed on the chalk board behind the bar. We also don't mind paying good money for quality beer. We questioned the tab and the person behind the bar investigated and said the tall thin woman, who was short with us earlier, charged us for the two large bottles of some vintage or specialty bottle, which is not what we ordered nor what she served. She eventually fixed the tab but it was a very sketchy 'mistake' and the entire experience was memorable in a terrible way. We will not be back and are disappointed since we went in very excited to try it out. I don't recommend this bar."

Came in on a cold Wed January evening and my friend and I, save for whom I can only assume was a regular, were the only ones in the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and appreciated that we concurred on beer suggestions for my friend.   I really loved that they serve the beers in their correct respective glassware (especially the Kwak, which is worth ordering for the glass apparatus alone!).  The prices per serving are a bit on the higher-end of the Belgian Beer spectrum from other bars I have had the same beers at, but honestly,  I liken this sitch to the line from \"The Prince and Me\"...\"you can really taste the extra 10 cents\".   For a place that's French for 'Sudden Death', it isn't nearly all that intesnse, but when I had my first pour of their Gulden Draak 9000 Quad, I did kinda feel like I'd died and gone to Belgian Beer heaven!"

The first time I came to Mort Subite I can no longer remember, probably because it was underwhelming but after a lot of people told me to go there as a Belgian, I figured to give it another chance as I was pretty excited to have a La Chouffe on draft. When I noticed that the bartender was pouring this high ABV beer wrong, I asked him if I could give him some advice on how to pour it better. His answer was simply \"no\" and walked away while he handed my my check. Completely mesmerized, I still tipped him, and walked away. When I explained to my friend what happened, he said I needed to have given context.  So I went back in, ordered another La Chouffe and as soon as he placed the glass under the tap, not holding or tilting it, I apologized for earlier and asked him again if I could give some advice as a Belgian who has had many years experience working in bars. He immediately stopped the pour and  looked at me. When I explained him to hold the glass, tilt it and pour the beer on the spot where your finger is, and how that technique is very common and necessary to pour high ABV beer, he just stared me dead in the eye and continue to pour as he started, wasting a lot of beer and giving me a shitty poured beer.  I send management an email since I thought that they would love to be aware about this before I put anything online but after almost a two weeks of no response, I feel obligated to share this experience."

                "description": "Gave Mort Subite another shot as Belgian beer is the one true god of beers and can't stand not going to one of the truly Belgian bars in the country.  Again, takes a long time to get served as each pour is perfect and looks delicate.  Menu doesn't change often on draft and was 90% the same.  However, this is some of the freshest draft Belgians I've ever had, and have some rare varieties that you mainly only see in bottles.  Prices are very high and 150% of any other bar in town, but this is the quality stuff and high abv.  Now that they have a food truck out back with some good looking Indian, Mort Subite might be worth adding to my list of usuals when in that Belgian mood.  You should expect a long wait at the bar, high bill, but overall a great beer pour."

                "description": "This place is awesome! A Belgian beer bar? In Austin?! Yes please. Awesome rotating selection of Belgian beers. Our bartender Anthony was very friendly and did not hesitate to explain each beer. And he steered to one that we loved. They have a food truck in the back, Indian food, if you are hungry. We did not eat, but I am glad it is there if needed. I will be a regular here. I love Belgian beer, and hate having to hunt for it at local bars, restaurants, or trying to get it delivered online is hard and expensive. THIS IS THE PLACE FOR GREAT BELGIAN BEER!"

                "description": "A cute sorta tiki lounge. Want a micro staycation? If you allow your imagination to suspend disbelief, Anthem could be a tiki lounge on one of the islands of Hawaii...without the airfare to get there. The decor of longboards, hula girl jiggle figurines, and tiki torches can transport you for an hour or two to a tropical paradise.  The service was perfect! I unfortunately did not get the bartender's name, but he was prompt in greeting me, and offering to get me a drink to start my evening. My guy was parking the car so I ordered appetizers and drinks before HH ended. We had blood orange frozen margaritas which were delicious. We tried the fried cauliflower and some guacamole. Both had good sized portions and were tasty.  Another bartender checked on us as she walked by, which was great. I love when everyone works together to provide excellent service. There were two hosts at the door to greet people- they were both professional, warm, friendly, and prompt as well. Good job, Anthem in choosing excellent staff.  The decor was spot on. It felt upscale without the upscale prices. We sat at the bar, and the stools were comfortable enough to have a full meal if you were to choose to do so. Overall, the place was clean and spacious as well. Go check it out and let me know what you think. Aloha!"

He was super friendly and helpful and made us 2 Austin visitors feel right at home. Thankful for you!!!  Now, the food. The JFC Popcorn Chicken was FIRE. We ordered the honey sesame version that was sooooo tasty!!  The sweet potato waffle fries were a hit too, and so was the chips and guac.   We also had espresso martinis that were surprisingly without coffee beans but still tasted good!  Overall, we LOVED our experience here. Whether it was Christian's incredible service or the amazing food, everything about this place was a treat. Would love to come back next time we're in town!!!"

Both of our drinks were so delicious that we each got the others drink order for the second round.   The yummy fries were so so yummy.  I highly suggest.  The brisket wontons also were so great.   The place is super cute.  I would have much preferred to sit in the front more part of the restaurant with the bar. It's decorated so adorable and the booths are intimate and adorable.   The service was amazing. We had several different people waiting on our table so I'm not super sure how that worked out but it did.  It worked very well.  10/10 recommend.  Great place.   It was kinda hard to find parking tho."

                "description": "I was blown away by this place - Texasian?! I have never heard of that fusion before but I am so glad it exists. I wish this was everywhere!  A group of 9 of us came here for dinner and we were all so impressed with the food. The appetizers are where it's at . The yummy fries blew some of us away - WOW. The brisket rangoon was outstanding. And the miso mac daddy....c'mon.   I would say the appetizers were more star players than the entrees. Don't get me wrong, the entrees were delicious too but I can't get over the apps.  The service was good. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us frequently. However, she did tell us there was a 2 hour service limit....  The decor was very cool and the whole restaurant had mood lighting. We had reservations at 6:30 and it was pretty dead at that time but really picked up 30 minutes later. Once it was a full house the atmosphere became louder and more vibrant. Right on S. Congress, where the bars are, I didn't see many parking options.  Overall, I want to come back here. I want a texasian restaurant in my city immediately! For now, i will just have to recreate their menu on my own."

They have weekday happy hour which is basically only good for the drinks. Not many shareable food items on it. I'm so glad to have found this spot. The drinks were so great! These two drinks gave me the perfect buzzz. If you like fruity drinks try the Splash and EXSW (East by Southwest) hate the name but love the drink. We ordered the furikake fries which is the perfect comfort food and filling definitely big enough to share between 3-5 people! We also ordered the popcorn chicken, I personally did not like whatever coating/breading. Service was fast. I would definitely dine in again for weekend brunch or an early dinner."

                "description": "It's probably clear from other reviews that two of their best dishes are Brisket Rangoons and Miso Mac Daddy. However, don't sleep on the Nam Nom Noodle Salad! I almost never order salads from restaurants, but this one is worth it. It's the most flavorful salad I've ever had, and the balance of textures sends it over the top. Just as I was proofreading this post the manager came by to check that my meal was good. Their attention to detail keeps Anthem at the very top of my favorite restaurant list!"

It is a savvy mix of Asian and Latin cuisine with a fun spin, and it's affordable. Don't sleep on the miso Mac daddy -- it's a combination of like Mac and cheese balls and sushi. Truly amazing. The fried tofu app was delicious as well. For entrees, my partner had the noodle salad (yum), and I had the vegan curry dog (comes on a pretzel bun), and you can't go wrong with either. Really, it seemed like you can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Staff are all young, welcoming, and friendly. Added bonus: GREAT happy hour and cocktail menu in general. I'd eat here weekly if we were local."

For the main course I got the Border Salad, which fed myself and my mom. Would definitely recommend. My husband got and loved the Hilo Chicken Sandwich with Furikake Fries (Furikake is a Japanese seasoning - mix of sesame seeds and dried seaweed).   Wish we lived in Texas, this place was fabulous! Great atmosphere, big screen TV's for sports, and an extensive drink menu as well"

That was definitely the move - 4 of us shared The Cure, the Aloha Burger, and the Hilo Hawaiian Sandwich with 2 sides (Roasted Cauliflower w/ vegan thai green goddess dressing and the Sweet Potato Fries w/ truffle yuzu and miso aioli).  This was the PERFECT amount for the 4 of us to share. The staff even split the burger and sandwich in half for us without us even asking! We were also able to super easily split the bill evenly.  Our server was polite and attentive. The vibe of the restaurant was so fun and unique. We did have reservations for 8:45pm on Sunday night, however, I don't think we would have needed them because the restaurant was not very busy despite how delicious it was!  HOT TIPS: - definitely try the Brisket Rangoons and Hilo Hawaiian Sandwich!"

HAPA CHICKEN SANDWICH  $14 and HILO HAWAIIAN SANDWICH $17 - We got these two with an order of the sweet potato waffle fries and an order of FURIKAKE FRIES. Between the two sandwiches I liked the chicken one better. The hawaiian had a lot going on and frankly I think there was too much competition between all they ingredients for any one of them to stand out. Additionally I don't think it was worth $17. The chicken sandwich was simpler, but because of it I remember the chicken. Both types of fries were good. The Furikake didn't add anything to the regular fries.   PIÑA OLD FASHIONED - I never order old fashioneds, but everything else I wanted from the happy hour menu was unavailable. I was not disappointed. it had a tasty dried ginger and pineapple garnish which I munched on and the drink itself was both strong and delightful!

Mai Tai cocktail is served in a Chinese vintage take out! ( so cool and Instagrammable ). The pineapple bread pudding is so good! Warm delicious and not overly sweet which is great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!   Can we go back to our server!?  Dalton! It was a pleasure to be served by you on my birthday!

On an average sweltering Austin day/night I can imagine Whip In being the essential local spot for a quick beer or 5. With a great selection of beers on tap, along with extensive coolers for carry out, this place seems just great.  Apparently they have food too? Whip In should be the norm for corner stores/bars everywhere. Kudos fellas"

                "description": "This is a unique locally grown spot that is worth a visit in South Austin. Prior to the pandemic a popular spot to catch bands on the outdoor stage, not too sure about the music situation right now. The Whip In is a corner beverage depot with a quality selection of craft wine and beer. If I may add, a very quality selection of wine and beer. If you want to expand your palette and try  a new craft beer or wine, def stop in. Very large selection of chilled rose, which I found impressive. The selection of beers by the glass is also impressive. This is a very cool spot to come in and meet friends, and grab a pint. The Whip In is also an Indian restaurant. The quality of the food is not a 5, but a 4. If you are looking for great Indian food there are better options, but the overall experience here and what it offers is above average and worth a visit."

                "description": "Really disappointing tonight at the Whip In. I think it was an off night? First off, the draught board which is usually full up to 70+ was very scarce, so not sure what was going on there.  We ordered the chicken vindaloo and chicken shawarma. I was confused when our food came out for 2 reasons: 1) I wasn't expecting a wrap and fries for the shawarma- just was expecting rice since the menu didn't describe it as a wrap, but whatever - my bad 2) it came in takeout containers with only one set of silverware (plastic)  I went back inside to ask for another set and also asked if why (out of curiosity) the presentation had changed to takeout containers. I was told \"it's a covid thing\". I tried to explain nicely that I understood - but have only been in Austin since covid and have come every week or so since January, always with plates etc. She repeated, seeming annoyed with the question, that it was a covid thing, shoved me two mini plates and some silverware and walked away. Ok, cool!   I'm only giving a 3 because I have been here 6-7 times, always with a great experience. Tonight was a 1 star for service, but honestly food was below par as well. Leaving a sad customer :("

The food is genuinely good whether you're getting standard bar fare or the tasty Indian specialties. We hope to return when a band plays on stage, but we had the best relaxed lunch on the covered patio on our way out of town. Who knew you could find a little calm oasis so close to the interstate? It's quirky and perfect."

I have come to the Whip In for years (I still remember playing a show here when I was a kid in my father's band and having one of best and most interesting Indian fusion chicken fried steaks of my life) and always appreciated (and still do) what they're doing. But the prices are just getting too damn high.        As of the past week, every single beer on tap has risen by a price of roughly $3 on average; essentially the base price for any beer on tap STARTS at $8, and without a doubt that's the highest I've seen at any establisbment in Austin, and I have been to an uncountable number. I also had their $12.99 Kurma (also known as Korma in some resturaunts) and it was good, but more like a $8.99 Korma at Tejis as fas as quantity and depth of flavor goes.        Make no mistake, this is an indesputed historic establishment that's likely also struggling with COVID and I'll still support it, but seeing these changes is just disheartening and it's getting harder and harder for me to justify still stopping in on the weekend."

Constant staff turnover, and the menu and beer selection has shrunk to basically half of what it was.   The food in particular is a shadow of what it used to be. Tonight, after finding out they didn't have any of the specials on the board, we ordered chips and queso and after bringing us one order, they brought us a second mistakenly? Both had stale chips and the queso was burnt. I asked for no cilantro in my dish due to an allergy and it was absolutely lousy with it. Tried to drown my sorrows with a beer and was served the wrong one.   Honestly, not sure what changed but this place isn't what it used to be. Hopefully it's just an off night, but I've thought that several times in the past few months and it's only become worse."

The beer selection for purchase might be my favorite in town that I have found so far. They carry my two favorite breweries which aren't found many places and then have a multitude of beers on tap, too! I love the tarot card feel at each of the booths and then the perfect little patio outside.  Dog friendly, live music when the world is allowed to sing again, and Indian food? You would never know.... we brought some friends here recently and quite honestly... this might be my new little \"let me take you to a local spot we love.....\" for our guests. Go. Have a beer. Buy some to take home.... and definitely get some garlic naan."

I ordered a chicken tikka masala curry along with two beers - Belgian ale and a wheat. The CTM was a decent size and quality for the $12 tag. I'll definitely come back again to relax with friends and my doggo in the future. I thought the fridges in the back full of beer was pretty cool.  TLDR - decent food and draft beer selection - bunch of freezers with lots of beers and shelves of wines - cool music - had one TV inside from what I could see"

I ordered the bhindi (okra), and loved how tomato-y it was. Okra at indian restaurants is my go-to, since I am fan of its texture and all the spices typically used. Whip In did not disappoint; however, I am sure this dish may not be for everyone. If you like the idea of an uber savory, tomato-paste-based okra dish with lots of Indian spices, this is the dish for you. Finally, the okra texture was quite stiff because I suspect they used a rather dry/old part of the plant. :/   The rest of our party ordered chicken vindaloo, and they also enjoyed their dishes. I found the vinaigrette-cabbage side to be moldy, but D. did not think so.   Minusing a couple stars because Whip In seems to skimp on using fresh ingredients. I can see myself coming back here though, since I do love Indian food and live music."

Our AirBnB host recommended Gourmands as a good local spot.  We headed over and found there was plenty of parking and it was very quiet on a random weekday around lunchtime.  I like their system of scanning the menu and just ordering from the table, however it was sort of odd to not interact with anyone upon entering.  The only real greeting we received was from someone poking their head out of kitchen to let us know we could sit anywhere and order with the QR code. I imagine that would be a but different when the restaurant is more crowded though. We ordered some soup in a bread bowl and a couple sandwiches.  The food was promptly brought to us.  The bread bowl was awesome, along with the chili.  The sandwiches were also good, high quality bread and everything on the sandwich tasted very fresh!  Gourmands was a solid place to get some fresh food quickly without having to wrestle with parking and lines in some of the more populated areas of Austin. Good lunch spot!"

The salads can be weird, and I'm not a fan of the soup+bread bowls, but conceptually they are interesting.   Eating in at Gourmands is more fun if you go alone. The atmosphere is very traditional pub, so if you're seated at the bar having a meal and your drink, you'll almost always find good conversation. It's less fun to go with someone for a sit down meal, as it really is more of a bar than a restaurant, even though the food is pretty good. Quirky's not exactly the right word. It's idiosyncratic, and kind of addicting?   After Thoughts for Advanced Listeners: I want to be at a place in my journey where I can eat a Cleopatra and not feel I'm missing out on meat."

                "description": "I really wish I loved this place more because I was so excited to bread bowls, but it fell really short of my expectations. My friend and I sat in the outdoor patio area, and there were so many empty tables with eaten food left on the tables that hadn't been cleared yet. Summer is coming, so there were a ton of flies that were attracted to the food that eventually came to bother us when our food arrived.   My friend and I ordered spinach and artichoke dip to share, and I had the clam chowder and Deadly Sin sandwich combo. Firstly, the spinach and artichoke dip had so much cream cheese in it that it didn't taste like artichoke or spinach. It was really thick and gloppy, and I felt heavy just eating it. My clam chowder was really lacking in the clam flavor, and it also wasn't that good. The sandwich was okay. Nothing special about it.   I am pretty sad that I didn't love this place because prices aren't terrible, and the concept of soup in bread bowls is awesome. Not many places in Austin serve that. However, they seem really understaffed and the food itself isn't good enough to warrant a second trip."

As a non-drinker my tastebuds didn't compute this right on the first try. The soup and bread bowls are delicious but of course they leave you feeling extremely full! I'd been craving a chicken salad sandwich, so the Foghorn Leghorn hit the spot."

Their delivery system is a bit cumbersome and has glitches but they're aware and make it right when it messes up. In person, this place has awesome ping pong table set up as well as a great outdoor space. It's a great hangout. Chill and has great food - the two best things you want in a gastro-pub."

The sandwiches are beyond incredible and can't come recommended enough! Right now, you seat yourself and order from your phone at your table via a QR code.   We got the Second Deadly Sin and Chili, and both came out delicious and served with house made pickles and chips. The Black Bean soups is in incredible vegan option I've had multiple times.

They have a great tasting  Prickly Pear Lemonade.  The rest of the people in my party had great looking food come out too.    And they have a parking lot, but there is also easy street parking too.

                "description": "A combo lunch that doesn't skimp on portions for only $10?!? Hot dog! Well, more like hot soup and sandwich or salad (no hot dogs on the menu).   The soup is served in a bread bowl (French bread, not sourdough!) and they have four or five options. I went with the broccoli and cheese which was more like queso with a few chunks of broccoli in it, but heck, maybe Gourmands knows me better than I know myself, as that's probably what I really wanted anyhow! I scarfed it down and had to stop myself from eating the entire bowl of bread. The chicken salad sandwich was lovely, but because I went full hungry girl on the soup (and homemade chips), I didn't eat it until the next day for lunch. Again, a lot of combo for your buck!  The place definitely blends in with the neighborhood, it's dive-y looking on the inside with a bunch of cheerful regulars at the bar (also the type of establishment you'd see a baby on a hip and a beer in hand), a TON of tables and booths for groups, and ping pong and skee-ball in the back. They've got a small parking lot, too."

We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which we always do and it was literally milk with artichokes it was pretty gross. Then it took over an hour to get our soups and sandwiches. THEN on top of that i ordered the royal and they gave me mushrooms instead of meat (which I didn't order). I did tell the waiter and all he said was sorry(didn't offer to fix it). It sucks but i don't think i'll be returning there which is a shame bc i tell all my friends and always speak so highly about it."

I can see this place being an awesome, standard spot to grab a drink with regulars on any given day or night, but what we came in for was their highly-rated bread bowl soups and dang - they don't disappoint. The bread was soft and the perfect consistency - sturdy yet edible, which I feel is hard to come by with bread bowls. They offer a lot of great lunch options, like a soup and salad, sandwich and salad, or salad and soup. I went with the cobb salad and their black bean soup. To be fair, the server did warn me the soup was spicy, but I was definitely sweating a bit while sipping this delicious soup. The bread was a wonderful compliment to the spice and really soaked it up so I could keep going back for more!  On the way out, we noticed a room in the back with skee ball. Yep, we will be back for sure."

I really appreciated their drink menu in general, I mean they had Jell-O shots! Yes please! I will be back for that when I'm in a boozier mood. The food was great, it was hard to pick as so many sandwiches looked good. We went with the bacchus, Texas chili, the second deadly sin, and clam chowder in a bread bowl. The plates came with chow chow and house chips. We ate up every bite! I'll be back for sure, and next time I'm getting a Jell-O shot!"

Second, while a very small choice of items on menu, they are very diverse.  Third, as mentioned in other reviews, service is casual/slow. But the staff is really friendly and I wasn't in a hurry.  Fourth, the portion and quality of food is excellent. I highly recommend the clam chowder. The chicken tortilla salad was good, but it was unexpectedly spicy.  Fifth, you would normally pay twice the amount at lesser restaurants. 2 local draughts, soup, full salad $24.   So, drop by. I know I will be returning.  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - my experience was majorly disappointing. Recommend keep searching for another establishment. 2 Stars - Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Really good! This is worth sharing the experience so others will want to try the place. 5 Stars - WOW! You really need to make sure you try this place out, worth planning your day / travels to go there.  If you are curious why I have so many 4 and 5 star ratings, it is because I tend to only seek Yelp reviews at this level."

If you want a clear-cut verdict from me, this may be it: If they didn't have a playground we would never go.  But they do, so you have to work with what's available.  The food was somewhat subpar, and it has been, consistently, over the years. The fries were the best part of my Buffalo chicken sandwich. The kiddo got chicken strips that were especially dry.   Then why the three stars?  The beer was flowing, the environment happy, with TVs showing the college football games and the kids were happy playing on the aforementioned playground.  So...it's a decent option for young families. And that's worth it on a midday Saturday meal."

We were able to enjoy their awesome happy hour. $4 Texas drafts and $6 appetizers, small boneless wings, or sliders. We decided to share three items. The blackened shrimp nachos were super tasty. I probably enjoyed these the most. The boneless wings with Buffalo sauce had just the right amount of sauce. The pulled pork sliders were a little short on the amount of pork, but still good. We ordered Eastcider drafts for $4 each. Our server was super nice and attentive. Everything came out fairly quickly too. Would definitely recommend their happy hour!"

It was a little confusing and chaotic upon arrival, as it was not clear if there was a host or hostess to seat us, or if it was open seating. And then once we were seated, there was some slight scrambling on who would be waiting our table. But other than that, it was smooth sailing and we really enjoyed our experience! I enjoy the fact that they offer happy hour even on a Friday, and their HH specials really can't be beat. My boyfriend gave high regards to the traditional wings, and my HH shrimp quesadilla was quite tasty too. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, and the manager also went above and beyond for us to honor a special request. Much appreciated! We will be back for sure!"

We ordered some appetizers including the fish sliders and regular doc's sliders, boneless wings and fried pickles. The fish sliders (blackened kind) were way too salty. The Doc's sliders were bland, and the wings did not have enough sauce on them, not to mention the meat was tough and did not seem fresh. The fried pickles were not good; not really much flavor. The best food item we ordered was the fajita quesadilla. As far as alcohol, the beers were really good and next time will probably skip the food here altogether and just have some drinks. We had the 40 acres cocktail, el Hibisco beer and Redbud beer, all very good.  I did like the atmosphere and the large outdoor area that is close to a playground for kids. It was a fun experience except for the food quality."

They have that crispy dive bar finish that I love in a wing. Opted for the sweet potato fries, which did not disappoint. Goat cheese salad was delicious as well. Don't have any pics bc we horked it down so fast. Did capture this brownie dessert picture. As you can imagine, it was absolutely to die for."

On Mondays, you can bet everyone is here for the margs.. At around 10PM, she told us that they ran out of margs...They seemed very understaffed. As for food, it wasn't great - Nachos were cold.  On the bright side, they do have plenty of outdoor seating."

HEY!!!!\" But honestly I had no clue they were yelling at me... so I kept walking just trying to mind my own business... but when I stepped into the bathroom and started doing my \"business\" some guy opened the door and started screaming to me about my dog (mid-piss) that I can't have my dog in the restaurant... ummm okay I guess I get it, I'll just leave to the patio as fast as I can.  WELLLL.... I left the bathroom... I was literally 3 steps away from the back door as possible.... and the SAME GUY literally screamed at me to go to the front, 30 feet to the front door (just to go to where my table was right next to the door where I was sitting with my gf along with another couple.)  He then tried forcing us to leave and said they were going to call the cops? I let this man know that we already paid out and were about to leave  and she was finishing her drink as this man GRABBED the drink from my girlfriends hand (half full) and pushed us out. Never felt so disrespected. Wont be returning."

My husband and I went for lunch - skipped drinks (I almost tried the special margaritas. They were only $2 and highly recommended by our cute, excellent server, Gracia.) We did lap up the piping hot chili con queso (topped with fresh tomatoes and red peppers), salsa and chips. I chose chicken fajita tacos - excellent! My husband devoured his blackened shrimp tacos dinner. They were beautifully presented and topped with fresh avocado (including black beans and rice).  We love this restaurant. Everyone is quite friendly. It is clean and provides spectacular patio dining under gorgeous trees and colorful umbrellas."

I had good experience with very few servers it seems like it's very self absorbed environment. I give props to any server that chooses to work there because it seems very toxic.  The food tastes like corner store food I even once found a roach in my cheese tots and the short Korean manager made me pay for it. Thanks docs for giving me a very poor experience!"

                "description": "A magical circus of a place.  Never mind they have a real circus wagon out on the side, out of which they serve Italian food.  Never mind the strings of colored lights that make the back yard look like a carnival midway.  Never mind that the Vortex theater is right inside.  So if you are a paying customer, just beyond the velvet door curtain of the Vortex, there really ARE sword swallowers, lesbian ring masters, dancing dryads in water pools, and mega-gods of universal destruction.   Actually what is behind the velvet door curtain changes every few weeks.   When you go it may be nuclear rainbow unicorns, cybernetic tap dancers and the Flaming King of the Empire of the Ashes.  There will always be something interesting behind the Vortex velvet door for sure.  However, it is just as magical out in the bar.  The bar magic goes on all night rather than ending at the one hour and forty minute mark.  Of course, part of the magic is EtOH.  EtOH produces far more intoxicating illusions than anything that goes on in the main hall of the Vortex.  (EtOH is chemical-ese for ethyl alcohol, otherwise known as booze.)  The Butterfly Bar serves first rate EtOH.  Most of the house drinks are girly cocktails of classical or recent provenance. These are fine for what they are.  However, they do one wicked little number called the Whippoorwill which is fine bourbon, cold brew coffee, New Orleans style chicory and foam with secret flavor ingredients.  The Ghost of Sherlock Holmes appears and takes you down all the secret passages of the house.  The magic is generally enhanced by broadcasts of best-of scenes from past Vortex productions, projected on one wall.  There are projections of obscure documentaries on another wall. These have no sound, and I can promise you, you have never heard of any of them.  There is a vending machine on the wall that will sell you thirty dollar forks, knives and spoons that will save the world.  (I am not making that last detail up. Check it out for yourself.)  There are cats who run the establishment and have more authority than the bartenders.  One particular kingly and somnolent feline decided he was going to take his nightly nap at my table on the bench.  He claimed his space where I otherwise would have preferred to sit, and owned half of my table for the rest of the night.  He occasionally roused himself for twenty seconds just to make sure no service dogs had entered the establishment. After that, he returned to his regal slumbers.  The most magical parts of the establishment however, are not the food truck, the colored lights, the video loops, the drinks or the cats,   The most magical parts of the Butterfly bar are the patrons.  This is one of the most fantastical people watching spots in Austin.  It is a world of twenty nine different genders. It is a world of eighty nine different art forms. It is a world of magical costumes to die for. It is a world of back stories that makes your Ghost of Sherlock Holmes seem relatively tame.  The imaginary characters on the Vortex Stage have nothing on the real-life characters that populate the Butterfly Bar  So come to the Butterfly Bar and watch all of the limits of your plain-jane everyday reality dissolve.  Bring your magic hat even if it is just an old Chicago White Sox cap you got as a kid at a ballgame.  After half an hour, you will be able to reach inside that baseball cap and pull out a talking marmoset."

They're also relatively expensive for the experience (for not knowing how to explain them). Also, I just don't find them good. Strong alcohol taste, and not in a good way...   On another note... Patrizis is an absolutely banger. 10/10 would recommend."

                "description": "This review might be a bit biased because I don't really enjoy the taste of alcohol, but here it goes:  I ordered the margarita and added the mango flavor for an additional $1. I couldn't taste any mango as it was all masked by the strong tequila. I'm not sure if all margs are like this, but it could have been because the ratio of tequila to everything else was off. My friends and I all agreed that the taste of alcohol was a bit too strong for a drink like a margarita.   I did like the ease of ordering drinks. We were eating at Patrizis and I liked how you could order and pay off your phone and they'd bring it straight to your table within 5min."

                "description": "Came here for the first time about a month ago. It's definitely an \"East Austin\" vibe, like a crazy backyard with statues and lights and mismatched patio tables.   I like that they do have a hostess at the front gate to seat you, so you don't have to do that awkward wandering around the yard looking for a table and feeling like everyone is staring at you. They also check IDs and take your temperature at the front.   Currently, all the ordering is done via your cell phone. Scan the QVC code, and then view the menu and place your order to your table number and they carry out your drinks. Note that when ordering liquor, it requires you to order food with it, so they have a menu of $2 bar snacks. After the first round, we notated that we had already ordered snacks, and were not required to buy more with every drink purchase. But they did check for the snacks when the drinks were brought out.  I've only tried the margarita and a dirty vodka martini, $9 and $10 respectively. DAMN. Those margaritas are GOOD and STRONG. I had 2 and i was....feeling no pain. My martini was also PERFECT. Worth the money, and if you get there during happy hour, the margs are only $5! I did also enjoy the little $2 package of trail mix with MandMs.   One thing I noticed was that the cup size seemed to change, one time i went and they were served in these short plastic cups and another time these taller plastic cups. I was a little concerned that there are inconsistent portions but I can't be sure.  Will definitely be back, those drinks are FIRE and i want to try the food truck. Also plenty of non street parking which i appreciate!"

                "description": "I arrived there the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Before riding there on my bike from 4 miles away,  i mapped out the route on Google Maps beforehand and Google said it was closed. the phone recording on the bar's answering machine said they were open for business. Still wanting to confirm,  i tried ordering some food/drink over the website and again it let me order food/drink.  So i arrive to the bar and there is a piece of paper stuck on door that said \"closed.\" About 4-5 others were standing around also surprised that it was closed. Butterfly Bar management lacked a modicum of courtesy to its potential customers by omitting  to mention on its website/ answering machine/ FB  that it was indeed closed on a non-holiday. Surprise!Customers are going to rely on that answering machine msg and actually take an Uber or ride their bikes several miles to get there. It would make sense to at least turn off the answering machine completely if you are not going to bother to change the outgoing message. I doubt i will venture out to Butterfly Bar again. Luckily, the very professionally-run Salty Sow nearby gave us excellent refreshments and earned the $100+ we spent that night."

                "description": "My friend and I came here on a blind double date for the first time on 9/17 at around 7:30 p.m. and thought the vibe was great until our waitress came up and introduced herself, but unfortunately I have forgotten her name( server: inside B) . She asked for a card for the tab and we asked if we could do two separate tabs to which she basically told us that we could be on one tab and figure out the rest on our own. Then as I offered up my card with a bit of hesitation she made a comment about how some of us in the group didn't know what it was like to go out prior to Covid and open a tab. Her facetious comment was directed at me being that I recently turned 21 and was the youngest. Next we received our drinks, I understand that some drinks are made bigger than others, but when my friends were brought their drinks they were all filled to the top, weheres mine was filled 3/4. I let it go and asked if we could get some more water and our waitress said ok and never came back until it was last call and my friend asked again, then she brought the water. Let me mention that we were not belligerent, we were in a space by ourselves and we had each ordered a single drink and had food. When we asked for our check, my friend asked our waitress how her night had been, thinking that if it had been busy then maybe she was just a bit frustrated and we should be understanding of that, instead she said it had been an easy night, then why rudeness directed at me? All people  in my party (with 2 being practically strangers) noticed the difference in attitude towards me compared to them. Overall it was very upsetting as a POC to get this clear difference in treatment from another POC at an establishment that loudly advocates for POC. I still tipped her, because we are in a pandemic it's the right thing to do, but I felt so strongly about this that it made me write my first yelp review."

Kind of hidden from the main road, the Butterfly Bar has one sign and a gate that you follow to an outdoor garden full of twinkle lights and laughing people. There's a stage where there's often performances and a little indoor cabin part where you order drinks. It's almost pitch black outside at night, but makes for a fun date and casual atmosphere.   I ordered a mojito and it was delicious and strong. I would 100% recommend going here if you're in the area! So fun and unique."

Great service that is quick and active, not the typical where you're standing there trying to make eye contact for 10 minutes.  Patrizi's out back so you got great food with good drink; not best selection of beer but local Texas.  Got a projector on the wall for special showings, but expect a hangout on most nights and not a get-some-work-done type of venue.  Overall a good spot and easy to find parking out back."

Getting into the parking lot kind of sucks if you are coming from Manor because it is such a small little entrance, if you have a bigger SUV, it might be tight for you. Otherwise, this place is amazing! There are a lot of different picnic tables outside and some w/umbrellas and some without. Also, some of them have heating lamps for when it is cold. They have a food truck here apparently that is supposed to be amazing, we didn't try it because we had already had dinner but the line to the food truck was literally out the fence. The butterfly bar also has indoor seating but the outside seating is more lively and fun! I had a sangria and it was super tasty! It had OJ and brown sugar in it made w/red wine! I love this place. They have a couple cats walkin around too, don't pet them, they don't like it. Cheers!"

                "description": "Definitely a cool spot! I found my self ordering drinks here when we came to seek our Patrizi's food truck.  I was actually surprised at the selection of drinks they had.  I immediately fell in love with the cocktail menu.  The bartender working that night was great.  My first cocktail was a surprise from my husband, the butterfly nectar.  It was simply divine!  I loved the addition of the flower in it too!  Next I ordered the Blossom cocktail and it was just as beautiful and tasty as the first!  They also have a nice selection of beer and wine too.   The inside bar has a vintage vibe going on.  It was comfortable.  I loved the openness of the outside patio area.  There were several nook and crannies to set up shop outside with your friends.    I am absolutely a fan of butterfly bar and would love to come back here.  I need to continue my exploration of the cocktail menu as it is lengthy!"

Ran into a group of grad students practicing Italian in the outdoor area, apparently they meet up frequently as well. They also have a couple of cats roaming around. Decorations are simple with string lights and everything.  Heard their food truck is also a great Italian spot, will come back at a later time to try it out!"

                "description": "When you're a fan of drinking, you either find loyal spots where you eventually become a regular, or mix it up just enough that people don't think you drink too much. I'm the latter. I love to find new spots to get a drink. Sometimes it will be months before I repeat a bar.   The Butterfly Bar is one of those places that I visit once every 6 or so months and wonder why I'm not there all the time. The servers are friendly, the patio is large and beautiful, they even have a greenhouse you can sit in for a magical evening among the garden. They have a place for everyone. Just sit back and enjoy the music, dancing, or movies.. whichever are going on at the time!   They have a great selection of wines and craft cocktails that alway please. They are a little on the pricey side as 2 margs were about $18, but they were perfectly mixed and not too sweet, so I'll take it.   Definitely stop by with an empty stomach, too, because Patritzi's is killer food-truck Italian spot and it's right there.. waiting..for you!"

A truly unique, multi-faceted gathering place with folks of all different backgrounds coming together to enjoy life- be that theatre, cocktails, food, or just laid back hangs with friends. A great place for birthdays and meet-ups. A happy hour that for sure puts a smile on your face. Interesting cocktails to explore. A food truck that will fill you up with delicious local ingredients and handmade pasta. And what began it all- the performing arts theatre that has been a part of the community for 30years. It's a special piece of Austin and one of the few left that are still holding their own while the condos encroach. Much magic resides here! (Pro-tip: get a sno.co snow cone from the trailer in the lot and get it spiked! Purrrfect for TX summers!!)"

I'm not a fan of the food and service (The servers literally interrupt you during the climax of the movie to say \"last call\"!).   I wish they shook up the menu and did more creative things. As I mentioned, I go frequently, and it's just the same stuff and it's honestly not that great.   I wish they had the the truffle parmesan popcorn or churro popcorn on the menu like the Alamo in SF."

They truly take silence seriously so it's always enjoyable to watch a movie here.  The parking garage is a bit tight to navigate, so it helps to drive slowly especially around turns. It's free though so that's great. I wish they had more plant-based menu options but it seems they're slowly starting to add some which is greatly appreciated.  Special events are starting to happen again, too! I can't wait for Master Pancake and movie parties to return! So much fun."

A great movie theater taken to the next level with gourmet food and drink that is brought to you while you enjoy your movie. It's everything that you would want!   They have burgers, pizza, salads, chicken fingers, great appetizers including cauliflower wings, mozzarella sticks, great popcorn and much more. My personal recommendation is to try the milkshakes (adult versions too) makes for a perfect combo while you watch your film.   The staff and service is incredible. They are prompt, kind and super friendly.   This is a great venue and makes for a great overall atmosphere for your movie day or night!"

I purchased online in advance (they sell out), picked my seats and showed up early for the previews. We watched the new Wes Anderson movie set in France, so all of the previews were in French and of old French films. Quirky. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the popcorn was good. The only things I didn't like were that the volume was really loud in the theater (a plus for some!), and the seats were fairly uncomfortable. Although it seems like a fun place to take a date, it probably isn't. They have a strict no talking policy  and promised to kick out anyone talking during the film."

                "description": "If you have food allergies - beware! The menu looks friendly, but the kitchen and staff are not.   I wrote down my order for a gluten-free pizza - cauliflower crust - and the server took it. Well, she vanished. The second server said he would followup on it. When the pizza arrived, we had our doubts so we asked the runner whether it was gluten-free.   The runner swore that the kitchen confirmed it was gluten-free. Well, here I am throwing up my guts because of my allergy - so, no, it was not gluten-free.   The first server was nowhere to be found. The second server tried to convince me I never mentioned gluten-free - well thank goodness I had my order in writing. I can't believe he tried to put their mistakes on me. Especially when I was the one suffering from the allergic reaction.   The manager said we should have received a square plate for a gluten-free pizza, not round. And basically, that there's nothing he can do about it.   Places that don't try to cater to food allergies - I get it. They're ignorant and need educating.   It's much worse when a place pretends it knows what it's doing but screws it up and has no system to fix it.   Here's a first step -- train the employees on food allergies? And please, if you make a mistake, apologize. Don't call your customer a liar? And don't just make it catering to vegan or gluten-free a \"marketing gimmick\" -- follow through in action."

I was able to curate my own video dance party and because of the Drafthouse, this event was everything I was hoping it would be.  From the staff being so helpful and accommodating (for ex. every time someone bought me a shot, if I wasn't at my seat, they made their way to find me and deliver it :p), to the help from the event manager David with all the fine details. The Studio 54 themed party I had envisioned came to full fruition that evening and the incredible people at the Alamo Drafthouse really made the night so special.   All my friends and family were just in awe of how well put together the party was and again, I have the Drafthouse to thank for that.  I could go on and on because I'm still on such a high due to the full success of the party.  10/10 would recommend. THE BEST THEATER CHAIN THERE IS. PERIOD."

                "description": "The Alamo Drafthouse Cinema is one unique movie theater. I came here last week for its \"terror Tuesday\" event with some friends and since I'm not from Austin, was quite surprised with the movie theater. Upon entering you are welcomed by a giant carpet and screen from the shining and can even take a picture in the tricycle (which is very, very cool). The theater itself is well decorated and gives you the feeling of a real old school cinema that takes movies very seriously. Upon entering the theater you are handed some water which is quite possibly the most thoughtful thing a movie theater can do instead of forcing you to pay $6 for a pop of bottled water. The theater itself is pretty standard minus the ledge in front of the seat. The seats themselves are by no means nice or comfortable, think old school stadium style seats but for what this theater is going for I actually get it.   If you are lucky enough to live near a movie theater that does all these special movie nights and plays old movies, you absolutely need to come and check it out. I really enjoyed seeing \"Let the right one in\" on the big screen and hope everyone keeps enjoying terror Tuesday's!"

                "description": "I never leave negative comments. But I feel like other parents of small children need to know about what happened at Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar after our family was kicked out of a Disney movie because of my 5-year old and they called the POLICE on us. Went with my wife and our three grade school age kids to see the Jungle Cruise last night. A kids movie. About 30-minutes into the movie the manager, MICHAEL WILCHESTER, kicked us out after he had received \"complaints from multiple groups\" that were upset that my 5-year old was \"talking\" during the movie. Talking, apparently, is when a small child is watching a kids movie and says things like \"dolphins\" or \"frogs\" or laughs when something funny happens. Kid stuff. There was three 20-something hipster wannabe ADULTS sitting to two seats away from my littlest that had already shushed a 5-year old in a kids movie (embarrassing on its own) before the incident and it was made pretty clear that the manager had received a complaint from ONE group before kicking out a family of five from a Disney movie. My wife and I are respectful people and I'd be the first to say if my little guy was being too loud and quiet him down myself. What Alamo Drafthouse did was sad, pathetic, rude, and bad business practice for a company that should want to keep families that spend money coming back despite streaming services and COVID. My wife tends to go mama bear in these situations, but in this case I was the one who lost my sh*t and I don't mind that I made a bit of a scene in the lobby (a few nice ladies came up and said the theatre were being horrible to us) after my 8-year old daughter started crying and telling the manager that she was sorry for her brother. The coward wouldn't even look at her when she spoke to him. NOT OK! Austin PD were call and complete dumbfounded by the fact that they were there over a customer service issue involving children. So Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar and Michael Wilchester like to pick on families with kids AND waste taxpayer dollars by divert public resources away from real crime. Pretty sad they felt like they needed the police to help them kick out a family of five at a movie theatre because of their own inability to do the right thing and tell the complainer adults that it's a kid at a kids move, GET OVER IT! Alamo Drafthouse is pathetic. The manager, Michael Wilchester, is pathetic. Austin PD were great guys. We will never be going back to this establishment and if you have young kids I'd think twice about going there. You've been warned. Be well, y'all."

Unique movies and events alongside first-run hits.  Coke, popcorn with REAL BUTTER, and a few hours of entertainment.  What more could you ask for?  Oh, yeah, that south Austin vibe!  I live north and often find myself at Village or Lakeline.  It's like being in a different city, though, as the eclectic and \"Austin flair\" mixes well with the everyday folks coming to the movies.  We just don't get that at much up north and it's good to remember how pleasantly diverse this city is in taste and style from restaurants to neighborhoods to people.  Will I be back?

I had some fruit loops and then some coco crispies. Both were tasty. Service was friendly and prompt. Price was a little high I thought for an adult to eat cereal and watch a kids show. I probably would be more inclined to go back again and be a return customer for the cereal party if adult tickets were cheaper, but it was fun for a one time thing. Cheers."

They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.  FAIL ALL AROUND!"

Apparently you get service that way.   Literally just walked in and got sat, was busy due to a UT game no problem. And then we just sit and wait and wait and wait. The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!! Cover 2, I'm afraid you will not see us again!!"

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

                "description": "It had been awhile since I'd been at this location. While I love the Cover 3 locations on Anderson Lane and Round Rock, this one has never really measured up. Today I stopped in for lunch and ordered the flat top cheeseburger that comes with Parmesan fries. Should have been a safe bet, right? It came out DRIPPING in grease that tasted truly awful. Even the fries, which are always good, no matter the location, were inedible, as they tasted like they were fried in oil that should have changed long ago. It pains me to leave food that I paid good money for, but that's just what I did after trying to force down a couple more bites I shouldn't have taken. I left 2/3 of the burger and most of the fries on the table. Considered complaining, and might have if the server had even asked how the food was, but she didn't ask, and she had to have noticed how little I had eaten. She just left the check by the barely eaten food.  I rarely send food back to the kitchen, and since this wasn't exactly fine dining, I let it go today. But tonight I'm regretting eating those two or three additional bites I shouldn't have taken. It truly wasn't fit for consumption."

Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

                "description": "I stopped by after reading a few Yelp reviews and what a great choice that was. I had the good fortune to sit at the bar and have Miranda take care of me. If I started a bar or a restaurant she would be my first hire (better give her a raise, Doug)!  She's friendly, professional and makes a great martini. The hospitality industry needs more Miranda's!    Now to the place itself. Cover 2 has a nice, open concept with the ubiquitous flat screens located around the bar and restaurant - it is a sports bar, after all.  The people working there are friendly and attentive while the noise level is energetic but not overly loud.    The food.  The Reuben was honestly just okay. The corned beef to Swiss cheese to kraut ratio is off (not enough kraut) and the bread was cooked to the point where it was as stiff as a board.  It tastes okay but the potential for a better sandwich is definitely there.  Ask for fries - they don't automatically come with it.   The fries were good and - just to see for myself - I ate half the Reuben and then ordered the wings.  The buffalo wings are tasty - not the best I've ever had but certainly worth sampling. Pair it with the 512 IPA and you have a winning combination.  Overall I would give Cover 2 a solid 8 on a 1-10 scale. The kitchen gets a 7, the bar an 8 and Miranda a 1o I think my math is right). If you're looking for a good sports bar that's not too sporty this is a solid choice."

                "description": "Just left brunch and it was honestly not what I was hoping for. We've eaten dinner there before and it was amazing. Had the tall blonde chick with Cali tats and she basically just guided us through the whole experienced and picked our food and wine out.   This time we waited quite a bit for our server to appear, when she finally did she just asked if we were ready. No hello, or how are you. She didn't seem enthusiastic about the menu and when we told her weren't ready yet the second time she came by, we felt a bunch of attitude. The biscuits are amazing but everything else? We ended up with some mediocre food that probably would've tasted better if we had better service. Maybe the service style is different in New Zealand but I think eye rolls are a universal language. No brunch for us here but we'll for sure come back for dinner though."

                "description": "Highly recommend! It's my birthday week and the girls and I motored up to Austin for wine tasting and fun! We ALWAYS do Sunday brunch so we had to do it in Austin. This place is great for large parties and it's beautifully decorated.  I had the CIDE-car, their apple cider version of a side car... Very tasty and STRONG! Biscuits were big, fluffy and flaky like they came from biscuit heaven and your great grandmomma was the one making them. The deviled eggs were DELICIOUS and I'd like to think of myself as a deviled egg connoisseur. Cinnamon roll. Better than ANY cinnamon roll you've ever had the pleasure of stuffing in your mouth. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! And the chicken fried ribeye with white gravy and collards..... All I can say is babyyyyyyyyyy this was definitely the definition of Southern cooking and hospitality. Our server Katie was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!  Here is what the others in my party had to say:  To start I had a Cide Car to drink, deviled eggs, and a mouthwatering buttermilk biscuit. My entree was the Chicken Fried Ribeye, served with a side of braised collard greens! I finished my meal off with a hot and fresh cinnamon roll! Everything was delicious! I cleared my entire plate! The service was amazing! Katie went above and beyond to build a strong connection! I definitely give everything a solid 5!  It was an amazing experience from the front door to the table. The manager came by to make sure everything was good. Katie (Server) she was so on point and made the dining experience pleasant. If you ever get a chance to go please ask for her. She took pics of us and made sure the table was happ. For me this place was a solid 5 and I will be back soon!"

We also had the pork chop that was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. We tried the beet salad which was tasty but a bit plain.   Disappointed in their cocktail list as there were very few options and they didn't have much mixers or fruit to muddle in. The service was also slow but pleasant."

I even asked to surprise me with any drink (with a few notes) and all my drinks were also well balanced and delicious.  Food - impressive.  Get the biscuits! Made fresh, so soft and fluffy. Comes with butter and honey. We also ordered the beets, and brussel sprouts. Both were great but the beets were delicious snd had more creative flavors. My man got the pork chop. He took a bite, closed his eyes, and leaned back. I've never seen him do this. Are you ok? Apparently the pork chop is really good. Melts in your mouth. I got the red fish which was tender, perfectly cooked and not dry. Also I don't like \"fishy\" tasting fish and this one was gentle in flavor. The risotto was flavorful and creamy too.  Parking - they have valet but it's slow. The guy was overwhelmed because he was working Alone in a saturday night downtown. Not his fault at all but def piles up.  Def a special date night spot"

                "description": "My wallet was telling me no, but my stomach was telling me yes! Some friends and I came in for brunch on Sunday and really enjoyed our time there. We started off with a cinnamon roll, which the server explained was made from biscuit dough. It was outstanding! We then ordered some biscuits for the table, and those blew us away. Hot, fresh, buttery biscuits served with butter, honey, and jam. Those might be the best biscuits I've ever had. For the entrée I ordered the Pollo Frito Loco Biscuit, chicken topped with slaw and honey. That was friggin great, super crispy chicken on a butter biscuit. Our server was great as well, he was the bartender, who made some mean mimosas for us. 10/10 would recommend."

The food was pretty good but the biscuits were hands down freaking amazing. I highly recommend!  Also got the Brussel sprouts and pork chop. No complaints with either, but not craving a second order of these either. Biscuits were definitely my favorite item out of the experience.   Nice place for date night or dinner with the parents.  Parking PSA: Fixe only offers valet parking but there's plenty of street parking/lot parking nearby. I recommend looking around versus spending even more on valet."

                "description": "It seems like Fixe Southern House has had its moment already - the empty tables both inside and outside at 7pm were both a blessing and a bit nerve-wracking. I called ahead of time to ask if they were dog friendly on their patio, and they are! I saw no reviews of being dog friendly on Google, Yelp, or on their website, so that was a nice surprise. They even brought a bowl of water for my pup. FYI, you can find street parking nearby quite easily.  The food was pretty great overall - our table shared multiple dishes. I enjoyed the homemade biscuits with seasonal apple butter and the pimento cheese and focaccia dish. The beet salad was so sweet and savory at the same time - delicious! I enjoyed the lobster and crawfish pot pie but wish I had eaten it faster when it was piping hot. The fried chicken was a bit burnt some places but did have a great crisp. The deviled eggs were deviled eggs and nothing to rave about, and the broccolini was a bit salty. I still really enjoyed my time there.  We didn't try any drinks but we did get dessert! The pecan pie was very sweet and heavy, I only had a bite. I did enjoy the blackberry cobbler and ice cream. How delightful.  Overall, a solid service and food selection make this a great stop for southern food. Perhaps an even better place to stop than some other spots in Austin for southern food due to ease of actually getting a table and nice/upscale (although not super modern) ambiance."

The service was just amazing: our waiter was patient and kind, knew every little detail on the menu and accommodated our needs very well.   Food:  Here are what we ordered and my personal takes on them.  - Fixe Biscuits: MUST GET. So far the best biscuits I have had. They came hot and fresh and have some chewy, crunchy texture. Divine!  - Deviled Eggs: Good but not exceptional. I do like them tho.  - Heritage Pork chop: I love this dish. It was seasoned perfectly: not too salty (this is very important to me). The meat was very tender and paired well with all the veggie on it.  - Texas Red Fish: It reminded me of the Thai sweet and sour fish.  - Lobster and Crawfish pot pie: MUST GET. You can taste the crawfish and lobster in it. The pie came out hot and it was just so yummy.   Dessert:  - Pecan pie - Chocolate truffle cake Tbh, I didn't like their dessert that much. They were just too overwhelmingly, sickly sweet. I like the presentation tho.   Overall, it was such a great experience. My family doesn't normally like heavy, southern food but they cleared the dish here."

They brought traditional charm into the atmosphere in a warm and hip way that made you feel at ease and simultaneously stimulated, in a good way. Such a cool place! Our server was Wyn. She was phenomenal! She was professional and friendly! Great sense of humor (dealing with our group, LOL) and made wonderful suggestions. The Brussels were spot on! (A favorite dish of mine, always order wherever I go). My friends had the pork chop and pot pie. They reported the pork chop had fantastic flavor, was cooked perfectly. And the pot pie was better than they had hoped. It was a lovely experience and I hope to return!"

Cherly was a kind and attentive server, giving us recommendations as we looked through the menu. To drink, we got the mimosa and cold brew martini-- both delicious!   Because we wanted to experience the biscuits in their true form (they have biscuit sandwiches but we didn't want any other flavors), we got the biscuit side dish. So yummy!! We split the shrimp and grits, which I thought was enough for two people.  Great ambiance and decor, along with cozy, trendy chairs! A perfect brunch. :)"

                "description": "I really enjoyed my last two lunches and dinner at this restaurant. The biscuits are horribly expensive and terribly delicious. I'm forced by my lack of self control to order them every time we visit.   I've had the pot pie, the fish fry and also the pork chop. All of these meals where great and worth going back for.   There is one issue the collard greens suck. They were gritty and this is the sort of thing that happens when the greens are not properly washed.  I'm an expert on this, growing up we grew greens in the back yard and it was always my job to harvest them, pick the greens off the stem and wash them. I can let the fact that they left some of the tender part of the stems attached but the grit. That is not forgiveable.   So my suggestion is to avoid them at all costs."

Whether you're an Austinite or a visitor, trust and believe these biscuits are worth a try.  The biscuits came with a delicious whipped butter, some fruit preserves, and local honey. They paired so well with the biscuits, and they came in abundance too! You can even buy the biscuits in bulk; Fixe really knows how good their biscuits are!  But, I knocked off a star because the other food was just average. We got a beet salad and fried chicken. Neither was bad, but neither really stood out. However, the price was reasonable, and I would come back to try the rest of the menu!  tl;dr COME FOR THE BISCUITS! They are 6/5 stars :)"

I was fortunate enough to have a friend bring me to this excellent restaurant and I cannot wait to return.  My order: - Lemon Drop Martini - Excellent!

They are salty, soft, with the perfect crunchy exterior (my mouth is watering writing this). They pair these amazing little fat bombs with apple butter, honey, and honey butter - AMAZING! - Shrimp and grits - So delicious! The shrimp is cooked perfectly and the grits are creamy and dreamy!  - Pear cobbler - Did you think you were eating Southern food to be healthy?? This is a treat yourself night if I've ever heard of one! Order this and you'll be swept away to sweet Southern heaven.  Support this downtown business! It is delicious and the service is excellent!

It was crazy packed on a Friday evening but they had plenty of seating indoors and outdoors!  We ordered the Foccacio cheese sticks (basil, mozzarella and goat cheese) - a hit for us when we ordered to go previously. We also tried something different which was the Monty. We also ordered a Caesar salad- pricey for a salad in my opinion but this is a good option if you feel like you need that balanced meal!  The Monty was the least of my favorite. We have stuck to ordering the Flying Garlic Pizza after our first visit and it never disappoints. It has become a must order for us and will continue to stay that way!"

                "description": "This is the worst experience I have had in awhile with management. To begin, with follow my pics.. I ordered a major tom (supreme pizza) with EXTRA sauce thru door dash. At 7:55 within a few min I received notification it was being picked up.  I call store to inquire how is that possible if it was freshly made. The store hung up on me. So, I worked w door dash who asked me to wait for delivery to see if there is a quality issue. I did just that, only to receive a pizza that was warm but based on the cheese amount, semi chilled veggies I knew I wasn't too off base when I had my reservations about it to begin with.  I call store - ask for manager, even though I know door dash will ultimately handle. However, I just wanted to know how you can make a pizza in 5 min and say its fresh. Manager says sorry for the hang up like she's singing to a tune of a tiny violin; then tells me they don't have base pizzas sitting around (kind of like Villa in the mall that adds toppings when u order). I ask why is there so much cheese then and no sauce. Clearly cheese is added and is already rubbered up. Short answer and ultimate answer from her was another unbelivable sorry and to work with door dash.   What's sad here..Villa Pizza (mall pizza) is better than this any day. And I'm kicking myself for not going with Salvation pizza instead. Aviator down south was awesome but this Parmer Lane site is lacking customer skills and good pizza."

                "description": "2nd favorite pizza in Austin!  I love pizza. If I were choosing my last meal it would be a toss up between pizza and beer or filet mignon and merlot (or Shiraz). I digress...pizza...it must have a great crust-never EVER soggy, a well-balanced sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Lastly, the maker must not skimp on the chosen toppings.  Well done, Aviator! My friend and I shared the \"pizza of the day\", and it was fabulous (though I don't remember the name of it). The crust had that initial crunch followed by the perfect chewiness. We each had a light beer with hints of blueberry-um...yummy!  Aviator is new to this location, and still getting established, so it was dead inside. I suspect this will be a popular lunch place for nearby companies such as Apple, Oracle, etc. There is a huge outside play area for those of you who have kiddos-great for birthday parties.  I prefer quieter places, so it misses the mark for me regarding atmosphere. You can see the pizza makers through a glass window, and the kitchen appeared clean. There are ample choices of beer and lots of great food options too. I've been twice and suspect it will be a fav of mine. Give it a try. Let me know what you think."

The 1st time I wrote off because I thought it was a fluke. Also, I know the staff is busy on a Saturday night and it's tough to find staffing these days during COVID. Maybe I'll try eating in store next time.   But cmon now, my wife is pissed off because I convinced her to get Aviator over another pizza shop. Well, whenever I get my order, I'll eat it in the doghouse when I get back."

So many options but I'm not sure if this will be high in my rotation of pizza places.   I do like the restaurant space. The outdoor area is nice and kid friendly with the playground. Aviator has a wide selection of beers (at least from what I could tell). I think the pizza is good but unfortunately I think there are better places for pizza. Weirdly, I think their normal pies (with red sauce) are kind of lackluster. I did enjoy their non-traditional pies. The chicken bacon ranch and the taco pizza were pretty great!"

                "description": "Today, I ordered a to-go order for pick-up so I could do yet ANOTHER lunch and learn... how much learning do I really need to do?????? I ordered two items: the caprese salad and the black olive and caprese pesto grinder.   Caprese-  Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh  mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, olive oil, or  balsamic vinaigrette. This is a menu item that really can't be 'messed up'. It is simple and to the point. This caprese was accompanied by a side of vinaigrette.  Black Olive and caprese pesto grinder-  This item was unexpectedly good. This meatless Monday treat contained black olives, mozzarella, red onions, baby spinach, and a Roma tomato pesto base. This sandwich provided a balanced mixture of sweet (from the tomatoes and red onions) slightly sour (from the mozzarella) and earthy (from the pesto) bites. Although hearty in its contents, this sandwich was actually very light on the palate.   #supportlocal"

                "description": "Happy to see a local pizzeria that's in NW Austin and dare I say better than Pinthouse? Two 14 inch / Large pizzas are enough for 3-4 people which amounts to $50 approximately. Pricing is reasonable. Online ordering is straightforward and pick up time is 20-30 minutes after an order is placed. I noticed they had ample seating both indoors and outdoors.   Our personal favorites include: 1. Flying Garlic: Garlic butter base, fresh baby spinach, roasted garlic, grilled chicken, feta and crushed red peppers. 2. The Greek: Pesto base, kalamata olives, portobella mushrooms, artichoke, feta and fresh basil 3. Spinach and Artichoke: Red sauce base, fresh baby spinach, artichoke, and feta cheese.   Another pizza we tried was called \"South Austin\" (Red sauce base, prosciutto, goat cheese, wild arugula tossed in our home made honey balsamic wine vinaigrette) was also good but not as tasty as the other three.  The crust was the perfect level of crunchiness without being overly done. Toppings were all fresh and VERY generous. We came back a second time in the same week. It's that good."

                "description": "On this deliciously lazy Sunday, the darling husband and I knew that pizza was just the only thing that would do. Jersey Giant Pizza, he suggested? Quick, easy, cheap, and reliably tasty. Closed on Sundays, I lamented. DeSano's, I countered? His eyes lit up, but then I remembered that, although we adore DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana to bloody distraction, we should probably try something brand-new for a little variety...and for me to review! Why not? Enter Aviator Pizza and Drafthouse!  Local? Check! Solid reviews? Check. Hubby's a helicopter pilot and trying out this place is, therefore, too hard to resist? Check. Cute pizza names? Check. Yummy pictures? Check. Let's do this!   (Note: all three are takeout 9-inch pies with no mods, except for hubby's deletion of the green peppers on his Ground Control.)  The Greek: this one was my flavor profile to an ABSOLUTE T! It reminded me a bit of Joe's Pizza at Star Pizza in Houston, but better! A riotous feta, pesto, artichoke, basil, mushroom, and kalamata olive party on a crust! Hugely flavorful! This goes on the culinary Rolodex post-haste!    The Flying Garlic: very garlicky! Shocker, right? Lol! Well, we are garlic people, so we endorse this pie whole-heartedly! The buttery crust, the garlic cloves, and the feta were just unctuous!   Ground Control (minus green peppers): Hubby liked this, but he didn't super-love it. He kept snagging pieces of the Greek and the Flying Garlic. I asked him what his least favorite part was, and he said that it really wasn't fair to judge it on such a small pie. He wants to give it one more shot with a larger pizza! His theory is that small pizzas make the fillings hard to shine. Makes sense!   As I write this, though, he's literally humming Ground Control to Major Tom as he kicks back on the couch playing Call of Duty: Cold War with a warm and happy belly, so I consider this a solid win. We'll definitely be back soon to dine in! Thanks, Aviator!"

                "description": "I've passed by Aviator several times and finally decided to try it with a friend.  We came at 8pm and the place was fairly busy. Unfortunately, the ordering process itself was very confusing. You can either follow a bunch of arrows to the counter and order (with few menus available), or you can seat yourself and order through a QR code and have someone bring your food to you.  We chose to go to the counter and ordered two Bear King beers that had great flavor- we were allowed to sample before ordering which was a plus. There were 50+ beers/wines to choose from so endless options... you can opt for a flight too. We also ordered two small pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Spinach and Artichoke) that came out in ~10 minutes. The pizzas had a thicker crust and were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely order again.   There were plenty of picnic style tables inside and out, and the outdoor patio had beautiful string lights, a playground, umbrellas, and lots of open space. Parking is easy in and easy out, and the staff were friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend Aviator. Great quality pizza in North Austin."

I arrived a little after the estimated pick up time and waited a little over 10 minutes when a waitress came to our window and said they got one of the pizzas wrong and had to remake it. We ended up waiting another 15-20 minutes. Finally we received the pizzas, but they didn't not bring our ranch, which did cost extra so I asked if we could get those. The waitress was obviously annoyed by our request and went to get the then which took another 5 minutes. Pizza was cold by the time we arrived home. Pizza was still very good, but the thin crust was very oddly cut. I would not recommend ordering curbside or online"

                "description": "3.5 stars for the cons, given that other, less refined establishments in town lack these issues entirely.  Pros: Cozy ambiance, intimate atmosphere inside, quaint almost romantic patio in the back that still feels as such even with multiple parties outside. Fit that in with some personable bartenders, and you've got the makings for a really nice date night! The Bartender who hosted us personally was wonderful company for conversation with the rest of my party, and she took the BEST care of us during our visit that she could.  Cons: An arguably limited selection of liquor for a place that seems to focus its pride on craft cocktails. It's understandable that the pandemic had severely limited business as of late to give any benefit of doubt, but combine that with a lack of providing customers with a preference of liquor for classic standard cocktails exacerbates this. The coups de Grace in dissatisfaction came when I was informed that the bar had absolutely no cherries to compliment a cocktail that is typically garnished with one. Other regulars who overheard me went out of their way to mention that it's a decision from the ownership down. If it's a matter of affordability for something as trivial yet pertinent as a jar of Luxardo cherries, then bigger core issues exist elsewhere; if it's a matter of personal opinion as to what constitutes tradition in a drink, that's even worse when any reasonable bartender or connoisseur should know that the \"best way\" to serve a drink is however the person consuming it wants it dressed."

I'm a cocktail enthusiast and admitted \"drink snob\" with very high expectations of any place that claims to be a \"cocktail bar\". The Tigress is like a \"small batch heaven\" located off the beaten path. The rotating menu is carefully curated and the liquor selection, though small, is a blend of unique, local, and masterfully crafted offerings. You won't find mass produced, highly generic, overly commercialized well spirits here. Though the seasonal menus are small, the bartenders are highly skilled and can handle almost any classic cocktail request. In fact, they've even introduced me to a few that I'd not heard of previously, but are now part of my \"at home\" offerings (The Trinidad Sour is a favorite I didn't know I had previously). From the perfectly selected glassware to the outstanding skill of the folks behind the bar, this place is a must visit for every cocktail conisouer looking for that one special place where you stop in for a drink and leave having had a memorable experience.    Despite having all the right things to lend itself to being a high-end elegant cocktail bar, The Tigress has a casual, local, friendly feel. If you don't fancy yourself a cocktail person, have no fear.The drinks are very reasonably priced and the bartenders are highly skilled at asking about your flavor profile preferences and making the perfect recommendations for both the experienced drinker as well as the cocktail novices of the world. Don't be afraid to ask their advice. I take friends and visitors from out of town here regularly and they've never steered us wrong.   Cheers!"

They have outdoor seating which can probably seat around 10 ppl - very small tables surrounded by a few chairs.   For drinks we ordered the boys of summer, paper tiger, leash-less and native tongue.  The drinks were very okay, hit or a miss . I liked the boys of summer, wasn't the best drink I've ever had but certainly better than the others.   Our hostess was a little moody for some reason. She asked   Overall- can surely try it out for a drink if you are in the neighborhood."

The parking here is limited though, not the bar's fault. A biker smashed into my side view mirror as I walked outside and he was screaming obscenities along with \"who parks here?\" To which I realized that I was parked (along with many other cars) in an extra wide and poorly marked bike lane."

If this were a Western saloon, there'd be a piano player, mopping his damn brow and waiting for higher spirits before smashing out a tune.  (you can even smoke outdoors, and if it's cold enough, no one will come out for a solid hour, guaranteed)  If you are not the type to make friends with every moron at the bar, this is a good place to seek some quiet and forgetfulness on off-hours, which are pretty much all hours not the weekend.  TCM is always on, subbed; Ida Lupino, Fred Macmurray, the Bogart, etc, become regulars to you, and inevitably some doofus pipes out, sure as God, \"You know, I think Empire Strikes Back is one of the top ten films on the planet.\"  Sit long enough, still, like a walking stick; in comes a Bumble date once or twice a week: a leather daddy with a face pitted by acne that got the best of him years ago is making up big time by going to absolute town on some mixed girls, reciting the old lines, sure as Old Faithful, pat and safe and just this shy of rote PUA material; a young guy is meeting a blonde with a bob, discussing schadenfreude, saudade, acentrism, kicking canes out from mobility-disadvantaged Nazis, and everyone works at IBM or Dell.  There is always a gang of strangers who know each other over drinks, stinking of the day; every time you come in, they're here, swigging down Claire's Knees and Plump Perfections.  Some of them probably even had a cookout or two before life got in the way.    Every year they do Tiki Week.  Someone's written them up recently.  One of the top cocktail holes in this wreck of a town.   There is something disgusting in being known. Thank the Lord if you are the type who is able to weave little shrouds and stitches of obscurance around your neck wattle and your denimed shanks.  This is a place to hide, to commiserate with your immoralities."

I was told that cocktails were their specialty so I just wanted to keep it simple and asked for a rum and diet coke.  The bartender immediately replied \"we don't carry anything with aspertame in it!!\"  Yet I could see regular coke in their cooler, so I think high fructose corn syrup is that much better?  There was no need to make that comment, simply state you don't have DIET. A little attitude, so so drinks.  No wonder at prime time there were only 4 or 5 people in the place."

Dim lighting and wood booths line the place. Funny to say, but they have he most comfortable bar stools I've ever sat on!   The bartender was very friendly, talkative and great at recommending drinks.   First, I had The Green Drink! She said you can only get it 1-2 times a year! Unique and tasty! Never had a drink with cilantro in it. Good balance of fresh herbs, pineapple and citrus.   Second drink, she made a custom cocktail for me. I was in the mood for gin but my favorite drinks are mojitos and vodka presses. She didn't bat an eyelash and whipped up something exactly to what I asked for.   Prices are average for a craft cocktail ($9-10). The green drink was $12 but not crazy for the specialty and freshness."

Located just a stone's throw away is the elusive Bar Ilegal, which used to be a really subtle and unnoticed mezcal bar before Rainey became what it is today. Overall Clive Bar is a great place to warmup for a night out on Rainey, esp with Container Bar just across the street."

To be honest, I was wandering down Rainey Street on a Saturday night, with certain bars with lines wrapping the block. Clive Bar though, seemed chill with no line and a decent amount of people where I could still have my own personal space.   Quickly got in and into the bar, bartenders were easily accessible which is a big bonus. 2 specialty cocktails for $20, I'm not complaining. Both drinks were made with love and a little heavy hand but you'll never hear me complain about it.   Another bonus, I was able to snag a table for our group and we were set for the evening. They had an awesome DJ playing 90s + 00s hip hop and RandB. Super dope bar with a cool outside space (Cornhole available) with a mezcal speakeasy as well.   For all the lines and drunk people, I'd come back here for a chill, lowkey night."

Well if I'm honest, she was watching the game, I was people watching!  The location is great. It's on a corner and has a good view of the street below. The rustic vibes and good music made for a nice time. The bartenders were all very kind and worked quickly. The drinks were made very very well. I had their signature Mule and my friend had a Strawberry Fizz. They were $10 each and I felt worth every penny. Now by 4:00 a younger rowdy crowd came in and the relaxed vibe changed. They stood in front of the tv and those of us watching the game quickly decided to leave. I am not taking away any stars for this because  I had a really good time and the bar itself cannot be held responsible for the how people act. Just go early"

The bartender told us all about how the building was used and he had a Hiiii he variety of mezcal and tequila. This was truly something out of a movie."

                "description": "Came here a couple of times recently and definitely enjoyed myself.  First, the bar has both an inside and outside area - the outside area is reasonably large, so that's where we spent most of our time. One point I want to make is that the bartenders were really nice throughout our visits there. They were friendly, remembered my name, and just did a great job in general.  One fun thing about this bar is that they have cornhole outside. Of course, it's only one set of boards, and you'll have plenty of other people wanting to play, so you can pretty much play a few games max. But a few games of cornhole is better than no games at all! One small negative about the place is that they had some pretty subpar BBQ restaurant serving food there (on a Thursday). Granted, it's not like the bar itself is serving the food, but I would have preferred they allowed a better restaurant to take up real estate.  Overall, I definitely recommend people come here and have a drink. And if you don't like it, you can go to one of the other many bars on Rainey St. :)"

                "description": "My review will focus on Bar Illegal. My friends and I were on the hunt to find speakeasies in Austin, and Bar Illegal is one of the easier ones to get to. It is visible from outside Clive Bar, but to get to Bar Illegal, you must walk through Clive Bar's outside area and into the small building that is roughly the size of a shed. The small structure seemed to be made of stones, and it had many cultural items representing Mexico that were spread around: religious paintings, prayer candles, skulls, and other decorations. There were only four other people not including the bartender and my group of three. I would approximate the 'comfortable limit' would be 10 people. The bartender was well educated on the topic mezcal! He got a sense of what we individually liked to drink, and he selected a different type of mezcal for each of us. I drank my mezcal as a shot since it's a little too strong for me, but the bartender suggested drinking it slowly. The prices of the mezcal were all under $10 for shot glass sized servings. The bartender was also awesome enough to suggest other speakeasies and tell us 'passwords' for one."

                "description": "Clive Bar holds a special place in my heart and is probably my favorite bar on Rainey Street.  When my husband and I started dating in 2011 it was where we would go often.  It was a different Rainey Street all together back then.  There were only like 3 bars in the area at the time.   Clive Bar used to have the frozen peach teas that were amazing!  I still think back to those and wish they still had them.  I usually ask every summer if they will bring them back - I really really wish they would.  All the bartenders here are amazing and super nice!  I love their drink menu and they have a nice selection of beer on tap as well.  They have some infused liquors too that change out every now and then.  Honestly if you don't know what you want just ask the bartenders what they recommend and tell them the flavors you like and they might be able to whip something up for you.    I also love the openness and atmosphere at Clive.  No matter the season it is always good.  They also have a Mezcal bar that is open on the weekends in the back.  If you have never experienced this I would highly recommend trying a flight to taste.    So if you are on Rainey Street - don't skip Clive Bar - it is a must stop for sure!"

                "description": "I'm a huge fan of mezcal, so when I heard a bar had a speakeasy-ish room in the back that specialized in it, clearly I had to pop in and check it out. I do feel like it would make more sense for it to be its own yelp page, as while it is owned jointly and running under the same liquor license, the purpose (tasting high quality mezcal) and menu (just a long list of mezcals) are totally different from the main bar. I didn't visit the main bar, just Bar Ilegal.   Anyway, unsurprisingly, it's tiny (could fit maybe a dozen people before it'd start to get uncomfortable), but when we were there, around 9 PM on a Saturday, it only had about 6 people in it - I suppose a bar for just tasting mezcal is pretty niche (they do have 4 mezcal cocktails as well, but they honestly didn't look like anything particularly spectacular). The bartender clearly knew his mezcal very well, and prices are actually surprisingly reasonable for a spirit-focused bar. I asked to try the smokiest reasonably-priced mezcal he had, and got one - Del Maguey's San Luis del Rio - that I absolutely loved, a half-pour for $6.50 (I also love that they do half-pours, for if your primary motivation is \"sample new mezcals\" rather than \"get crunk\"). Based on previous experience with places like this, I assumed it was a truly ludicrous markup and that I had just found my new favorite affordable mezcal, but nope! It's a 70 dollar mezcal. So, happy that I got to try a 70 dollar mezcal (it was delicious), but also a little sad because now I'm still looking for my \"can always keep a bottle at home\" affordable type mezcal. Oh well.   But anyway, yeah, if you like mezcal, you have to check out Bar Ilegal. Really wish my favorite mezcal bar locally would do mezcal samplings like this one does."

The interior is dark with leather studded bar stools and a few tables at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and attentive with good pours on our Maker's for $7 each and specialty bourbon drinks for $10 each.  They have an awesome Rock band that plays each Sunday afternoon. Really good set-list, front man, and rockin' guitar jams."

                "description": "During our first night in Austin last week, we ate at Emmer and Rye and then walked up Rainey looking to get the full experience so we tried out a handful of places. Clive really stood out to me as having the full package.   The inside space is cozy and lodge-y. Coming from MKE, we felt right at home. The outside deck and patio space is huge. Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and still keep a game of Bag Toss going.   Later in the week, we were with a bunch of our KW coworkers and one of our party members thought it would be a good idea to try out Container Bar. Wrong. It was a like an undergrad frat house in there. SO loud, SO sweaty, SO many college kids. No offense if that's your thing. Clive Bar SAVED THE DAY.   Get the Matthew Pecan-aughey."

Literally just get that drink everywhere now these days, but they make it damn good here. The inside of the bar easily makes this the place you'd bring a date on Rainey, but there is plenty of outdoor seating as well. Pretty sure they have live music on the weekends in the patio area, but it's definitely crowded as hell during those days.  Went out for the first time ever on a Monday tonight and ended up here. Ordered a round of Old Fashioneds for us to start off as usual. The drinks were more generous than on the weekends since there weren't many people on Rainey. Tom was the bartender tonight and actually gave me a free Inside Job cocktail after I talked to him for a bit. The drink was pretty similar to an Old Fashioned, so it was right up my alley. He was definitely a nice guy. Will probably be on Rainey at least a few more times as the semester winds down, and I'll be sure to visit Clive during each of those occasions as always."

Jarrod, the bartender, and Sam, the waitress made us feel at home and I made what was it looking like a pretty bleak Christmas Eve into a wonderful party night. Between the two of them, awesome awesome is the only word that I can use to describe the feeling of hospitality on Christmas Eve, it saved our night and made us loyal customers of crown and anchor whenever we will layover in Austin or visit.

We finally decided on a random Tuesday to pop in after work and we're kicking ourselves for waiting so long! This place was so great! They have QR code menus on each table for both food, and beer, and they were so user-friendly, and easy to navigate. The tables are spaced out, and there's seating on the front deck, under the cover on the patio, and some inside as well. The staff was seriously THE friendliest we have encountered in Austin, especially during COVID times. They checked on us regularly, and basically made it so we never had to go in and order anything, because they were SO on it! They are amazingly, over the top, dog friendly!!! It's one of the few spots we can sit under cover with our dog, they have tons of water bowls, free snacks, and they even brought him out a very special snack from the kitchen! They gave him lots of love, and were happy to have him there.  We ordered cheeseburger baskets with fries and they were so delicious! The portions were huge, but the burgers weren't so fat you couldn't handle them semi-gracefully. They were loaded with melting cheese, and the smoked bacon was amazing. There was an abundance of toppings, and a huge pile of perfectly crisped fries. The beer selection and HH is just awesome, we have zero complaints at all! We'll definitely become more regular patrons here, and I highly recommend going out of your way, giving them a chance, and checking out this perfect neighborhood bar!"

Basic wooden tables, a nice porch, 3 dart boards and 2 pool tables. You dont have to pay for darts, but you need collateral. They always have a great selection of beer, also they always have a nice deal on some type of beer they're trying to get rid of. Your dollar will go far at this place, especially during happy hour.  In terms of atmosphere, its no frills. Its great for big groups and small groups and hanging out. The porch is enclosed with screens but it is a little hot in the summer. Its great in the fall and spring though.  In terms of food, nothing is really stand out. But, it isnt bad either. Their burger is like the perfect backyard barbecue dad burger. Their fries are pretty good too but there jot artisanal. The cheese fries have a healthy amount of cheese. The nachos are fine too. The prices are a little high compared to the drinks. But, they're not unreasonable.  A lot of researchers at the university have happy hours here, so it gets busy on fridays especially during the semester. People from the neighborhood come too so theres always a crowd. That being said, youll usually be able to get a dart board or a pool table if you want it."

Look no further than the Crown and Anchor pub.   If you're looking for an expansive beer menu, they have it. Just about any craft beer you can think of is available.   If you're looking for great atmosphere, they own it. The owner Derven has been operating the place for 25 year and is a true Austinite. He has played gigs with many of the areas legendary musicians back the 80s. You can find him at the register most days haggling regulars and slinging beers.   Food? The food menu has the essentials and is affordable and tasty. It has enough options to satisfy just about anybody including a vegetarian or vegan and the food is always great and reasonably priced.   What else? Pool tables. Check. Darts. Check. Plenty of sitting area? Plenty of parking? Check and check.   Overall Crown and Anchor is a mellow and great dive to try a new beer, eat good burger or to clank glasses and cheers with beers at.   The old show Cheers comes to mind.

I'll be there twice a week probably! I miss it ALL THE TIME!"

I am not a burger snob, but I really do enjoy a nice burger and here they have it. You cannot rate it at the top with many others in the area of Austin, but for the price, the atmosphere, the location, and the great staff you cannot go wrong here.    It's a really solid burger that can feed your conversations with friends or fuel your hunger for a long night at the pub. On a side note, the fries were really good as well."

                "description": "This is borderline 5 stars, so I'll give the benefit to them.  Nice bartenders.  Great beer selection and beer prices.  The price varies depending on the type of beer and whether it is happy hour or not.  I got a pint of 512 pecan porter for $4 during happy hour.  They also have pitchers available.    This place is not upscale, but it is a chill place to grab a beer and hang out, watch the game (NBA playoffs and baseball were on while I was there) and there is indoor and outdoor seating and two pool tables.  I was there on Sunday night and pool was FREE!  I suck at pool and don't particularly like pool, but I was up for a few games to help kill the time, so that was an added bonus, especially if you like pool.  There were probably 20 or more beers on tap, lots of bottle and can options, so I'm sure you will find 2 or 5 things that you like.  Parking was free on Sunday.  Pro tip, go on SUNDAY!  I didn't get any food, but it looked like everyone was ordering nachos."

They were very nice and substituted chicken for our Piccata (In place of Veal), we also had the house special Spicy Rigatoni, lobster ravioli, and a delicious chicken vegetable. All this complimented by a few Martinis (shaken not stirred), a few glasses of red wine.  Would definitely recommend"

                "description": "Cucina had been on our date night list, so we were excited to try it. I'm writing this review a little later (we visited August 7th). For what we paid (Our bill was around $200+), the food was less than worth it. Our wine choice  - Lopez de Haro Crianza Tempranillo 2017 Rioja, which was a $44 bottle on their wine list. We use the Vivino app for reviewing wine, and making purchase decisions. This bottle sits at a 3.6 rating and sells for an average of $11.99 (eye roll). We love tempranillos but this was not good.  For appetizers we tried the Foccacia Bread, and the Arancini: Risotto balls. The risotto balls - SUPER dry and the breading was overcooked and practically charred. The saving grace for those was the marinara sauce to dip them in so we could add some flavor and soften them up. I can not believe these were $16. Moving on to the main dishes. We chose Gnocchi Diavolo - Fried potato pasta w/spicy Diavolo sauce ($27) and the Rigatoni Fornaio W/ pancetta, basil, tomatoes, mozzarella ($29). The Rigatoni - was one of the WORST pasta dishes i've ever had. I've made better in my kitchen at home. I don't know how one manages to make a pasta dish taste dry - but Cucina succeeded. It was like chalky paste in my mouth. And the mozzarella looked like packaged great value shredded cheese you get from the cheap section of HEB cheeses. It was also cold, and not melted in the slightest. I couldn't even finish it. The Gnocchi - which you can't normally go wrong with - it pains me to say we had to ADD SALT to the dish to make it taste like anything. I'll say it again... we had to ADD SALT TO OUR PASTA. The spicy Diavolo sauce, there was no flavor or spice. For an expensive Italian restaurant I expected way better. Zero excuse for customers having to add salt to their pasta dish. Desert and drinks - we chose the Affgato'bout it: Frangelico, Chocolate gelato and Espresso for $14. This was fine, you can't mess up ice cream - Probably came from a tub of $5 ice cream from HEB though. Finally we tried the Luxardo Limoncello, Campania - $10 and the Dow's 10 year Old Tawny n/v Port for $12. Fine just fine. Honestly yes, if we weren't happy about our food we should have said something to the waitress. However the wait staff was super kind and super great so we felt bad complaining. But this experience overall has weighed on us more and more as we've shared this terrible Italian food experience with our friends. Upset that we wasted our date night on this place, $200+ was insane. I'd choose Patrizy's food truck over this spot 100 times over."

I have to say - before I arrived I already had high expectations since they informed us there would be a fee if we canceled our reservations 2 hours prior to arrival and that we had to call if we were going to be 5 minutes late. Now I get why. So many people are involved in ensuring you have a great experience and a last minute cancellation could take away from someone else having that same great experience.  When we arrived they promptly took us to our table which was prepared as we requested. Won't lie, we had a lot of very specific requests since some of the attendees had major gluten allergies or had particular food preferences. Altogether this restaurant delivered! The food tasted great, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and seamlessly answered all our question.   We will definitely be back again!"

My husband and I  were in the mood for some really good pasta and drinks, so we decided to come here and try it out. Let's just say it was the best decision ever.  Place wasn't hard to find at all and parking was extremely close and not crowded at all. The place opened at five, we got there a few minutes early and we were allowed to still go in. We waited to be seated and took in how beautiful the place looked. We were greeted wonderfully by everyone in the restaurant and were directed to our seat. Our waiter introduced himself to us, asked us how our day was going, let us know what the special of the day was and kindly gave us time throughout the ordering process to order our beverages, appetizers, entrees, and dessert. Our waiter was amazing, very patient and gave us enough time to decide on what we wanted and checked on us frequently to make sure that we were enjoying our food and refill our wine glasses with our glass bottled, still water that we ordered. Every item that we ordered was beyond delicious, portion size was perfect, the tiramisu (spectacular) and my alcoholic beverage was divine, especially the house made maraschino cherry. The pasta and the calamari was so fresh and flavorful. The sauce for everything was amazing. The husband and I love this place so much already and we are definitely coming back. Thank you for making our experience here an amazing one."

The bolognese and arrabiata are good and the cocktails are strong, but the menu seems overpriced. The burrata is served ice cold and not as creamy as I've had it in other mid-priced restaurants in Austin. I highly doubt they make the rigatoni in house, but who knows! The service is good and the patio has fans in the summer and heaters in the winter."

But one night I found myself wanting a nice dinner and it was nearby and open. I ate at the bar and the bartender was delightful. The owner also hung out with all of us at the bar and chatted us up. The food, every morsel, was fantastic. I had the focaccia to start off with a mezcal Negroni. So freaking tasty. I forgot to take a picture of my main course because I was so excited but it was a tomato and gnocchi that was to die for. I had to get the tiramsu at that point and was full and not disappointed. Definitely doing a date night here soon."

Serving Northern Italian cuisine is their specialty and they have choices to suit every palate all the way from drinks to dessert. The service is excellent. Everyone is so gracious and welcoming, especially the owner, Al. Walking around with his ever-present glass of vino (sommelier!), ready to say hello, offer a recommendation from their unmatched wine selection, or crack a joke. I take a new guest with me almost every time I go because I feel it's my duty to introduce people to the amazing food that delights from its tucked away spot on South Lamar.

The squid ink pasta did not disappoint. We were all very happy with our choices. The waiter was attentive without being overbearing. The owner also watched our order and actually had the kitchen redo two plates because he was not satisfied! Respect for that."

Our group was served food family style, starting with charcuterie boards, followed by salads, and amazing, hearty entrees.  The charcuterie and salads were delicious, but obviously the real stars of the show were the entrees.   My absolutely favorite was the tomato cream sauce gnocchi. Holy CRAP this stuff was good. I kept going in for more, and more, and more... I noticed we had plenty to go around so I didn't feel bad about going in for like four helpings (literally). It was thaaat good.  The chicken parmesan was really good as well. Chicken was nice and moist and the dish overall had amazing flavor.   Another shining star on this establishment is the owner. He is the SWEETEST man I've ever met! We walked in and we were immediately treated like we were family. I'm talking hugs right at the door! He was just so sweet and clearly so passionate about people loving the food. Business owners like him are one of the reasons why I love working for Yelp - I really do get to meet the best people!   Highly, highly recommend if you're a lover of tasty Italian food and of course, wine. You will not be disappointed."

                "description": "It appears for \"some reason\", my initial review of this establishment was removed.  Not terribly surprised.  I will re-iterate.  We had a reservation for 10 on a weekend evening.  We were seated outside.  We ordered.  After more than 75 minutes had passed with no entrees hitting the table, a simple question was asked inside regarding the timeline of our orders.    Who I could only suppose was the owner came storming outside and immediately threatened me physically.  He had been seated at the bar and was visibly drinking throughout our entire wait.  My only guess is that he was intoxicated.  He asked me point-blank if I wanted to get up and fight him.  \"Do you want to get up and hit me\" were his exact words.  Subsequent to his threatening language in front of the entire patio, proceeded to loudly lecture and in no uncertain vulgar terms berate the entire table as to our ignorance of the time expected for such \"perfect\" cuisine.    He proceeded furthermore to continually escalate the disparagement of our entire group, ruining what otherwise could have been a nice dinner--even with the prolonged wait --had he possessed even one ounce of decent customer service, decorum and decency.  The night ended with him sloppily yelling, quite embarrassingly, in front of anyone who was forced to endure the show on the patio.    Time, money and atmosphere are much better consumed at Vespaio.  It is not how long the entree times were, it is how it could have been handled by an even-keeled, conscientious proprietor.  Quite a shame, as the final product upon service was quite good.  Unfortunately, ambience and customer service are part and parcel of what should be a total experience."

                "description": "Oh my osso buco!    First of all I made the mistake of not ordering this for my entree but I did get to taste a little that had me wanting more.   Presentation was perfect and tasted was even better.    So let me digress and now tell you about our appetizers.  We started with the cheese board which was nothing special presentation wise but who doesn't love cheese.   Ordered the burrata which was fabulous, different colors and taste of tomatoes and the burrata was so fresh.   Had the arracini as well which we cooked to a golden brown, not too oily and not overstuffed with rice.    For my entree I ordered the cioppino which had the most flavorful and aromatic broth with just the right amount of heat.  So tasty and generous portions of seafood.    Server was very friendly.   Restaurant had a nearby parking garage which is always a win in Austin."

They capture a broad spectrum of tastes and styles of beer. The food is bar style, wings, fries, tots, sandwiches, etc.  nothing I ate was noteworthy. There is room for improvement on greeting and service times.  There was one person working the bar and another waitress floating but no one approached us so we got up and asked.  Then another gentleman came from the back to wait on us.  There were not enough people in this place for the service not to be swift and great. Especially when I bring a party of 8 that are all eating and drinking. Anyway it's a good stop for a quick bite and a beer if you're in the area.  Just not a place on my list to revisit."

                "description": "Growler USA is definitely one of my favorite places to go to for drinks and food. There's a fantastic selection of beer; with something like 100 taps, you're bound to find something you like, whether you want a sour, IPA, or stout. Most of them are Texas beers and the selection is always changing. If you're not feeling beer, there are plenty of other drinks too: sodas, kombucha, wine, cider, mead, etc. A huge plus for me about Growler USA is they have pours starting from 4oz -- perfect for flights and lightweights! -- to the typical 12/16oz, and of course they fill growlers.  There is also decent food that goes a bit beyond typical pub food and is of course more varied than a food truck at a brewery. I'm particularly fond of the tater tots and mac and cheese, but it looks like they've added some new items to the menu in the last couple of months.   Another great aspect of Growler USA is the incredible staff. There is one woman in particular - her name eludes me - but she is extremely knowledgeable about beer of all kinds and can give you some great suggestions based on what you're feeling (or even if you're trying to do a beer and food pairing)!  I believe there is also some kind of special every day of the week. I know Sundays are $1 off sours, happy hour all day (discount on all appetizers), and I believe the tapover beers are discounted as well. Plus they do special events like Beer 101 classes. For all these reasons, I think Growler USA is a great value overall and there really is something for every taste. I know I'm always learning and trying something new every time I come here, and it keeps me coming back!"

                "description": "Take advantage of the specials and this can be a very reasonable place to get a good beer. The extensive menu and regular Tap Takeovers encourage would-be cicerones to expand their palate.  Don't bother with an entree. Food is mostly overpriced and underwhelming, so maybe get a large appetizer to share with your party. The wings and tots are alright and I hear good things about the pretzels.  The staff is all pretty nice. The price point and atmosphere attract a slightly older crowd for a location so close to a university, so don't worry about this place being flooded with undergrads like myself most of the time."

I just walked with my wife and daughter for lunch.  We waited a few minutes to be seated, or told to seat ourselves - but were totally ignored.  Finally a guy at the bar told the bartender that we had been waiting a while and she said, loud enough for us to hear, \"I don't care, I'm busy.\"  The place was not remotely packed.    Terrible, and very rude, service by the bartender working today.  Candidly one of the worst experiences I've had, and we didn't even make it to a table.  We headed over to Torchy's for a great meal instead."

Every time I find myself in this establishment, I am off-put by the care shown to me by the staff, and how excruciatingly good the service always is. Also another thing that irks me is just how good the pretzel is. Why can't other tap rooms produce a pretzel of the quality of the Food Truck Bavarian Pretzel.  Also the price of beer during happy hours, Friday's, and Sundays is OUTRAGEOUS. $3 on select beers?? What is this? My friends fridge?? On top of this the incredible selection makes me red in the face with frustration, that like that special someone, keeps me coming back for more.   All and all this establishment is painfully well run and makes me smile."

There are TVs and good music playing. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. The food selection is good and tastes good as well. We will definitely be back. This is a feel good place to relax and have a drink and bite to eat away from the typical touristy spots in Austin."

But they also offer samples before you commit to anything.  Didn't try food but it looked like typical pub fare from the menu.  Closes at midnight but kitchen closer to 11.  Free WiFi and about 5 TVs.  Main knock on this place is placement of TVs.  Almost 60% of the seats have no view of a TV.  If at bar you're sitting sideways to see and most high tops look out the window.  Will be back because I really liked the selection, but setup just seems pour for this type of bar."

                "description": "We really enjoy going to Little Woodrow's to watch NFL Sunday! They have 16 TVs spread out around the room. There's a mix between high tops and low tables, plus a large U-shaped bar in the back. They also have a front and back patio with additional TVs.  This location is strictly drinks so we usually bring food in with us we pick up on the way. The vibe is fun on Sunday's and if you want to mix it up, they have ping pong and beer pong out on the patios free to play."

                "description": "This place is horrible! They over charge you and then supplement the charges buy saying you order \"FREE NACHOS SALSA\" if you so happen to not want the free salsa and chips they and leave on the table unopened!!! Yup you guessed it they!! Wipe the table downs and recycle the chips and salsa! I wrote a review on this \"RACIST\" place on yelp for another HORRIBLE experience! But my buddy wanted to go yo local place and he duped me Into coming here on a fight night!   I wrote this review already and I think they got it removed because it was so damaging to what they call \"business motto\"!  I WILL MAKE THIS SIMPLE!  I went to this place to watch a fight with a buddy!  I am not a big drinker!! I ordered one drink!! JUST ONE! My buddy had two drinks I believe and he also happened to also not order free bag of chips and salsa! But they made they way from behind the bar to our table! SPLENDID!!!!! Fight is over and i want to pay my bill will honor and dignity!! NOPE NOT TODAY!!   The waitress brings the bills, my bill is over charged! So i asked her why am i being charged for chips and salsa! \"Hold on lemme get the manager!\"   This Sorry excuse of a manager walks to our table and requested the issue! As I explained to him that you are over charging customers, he states \"i do it to everyone and no one has a issue but you!\"   Ok, Manager today you will not over charge me and you will correctly charge me so i can be on my way!!   He violently yells at me and tells me to get out but then remembers he has to get rid of the evidence so he voids my transaction!  Charges My friend because he paid before me and DIDNT notice the over charge!   THIS PLACE IS RACIST!! THE way that Manager treated me as if we meet him before! I am a minority!! Why would he treat me as if i am hanging around this place! I was a patron and he treat me less then human after I discovered they COVID Gorging secret!! If allowed i will add pictures of receipt! Second bad experience i was in where i found myself being yelled at by a WOODROW employee while trying to pay!! I HAD TO WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW because they may have removed my other one!! I just want an explanation on why are you doing this to customers and why are you so aggressive with black customers! He was emotionally violent and it scared me so i walked away!  I just want clarity and a non aggressive place to have a beer or watch a fight in SOUTH AUSTIN while being BLACK!! Nothing much!"

                "description": "This is a great place to get drinks and watch sports. However on a day when the temperature is 30 degrees, I wish they would close the door. We might as well be sitting outside. Looks like a ski lodge with everyone bundled up. Not to mention covid and cedar are both high right now. Furthermore if I was running this establishment I think people would be more inclined to drink more if they weren't freezing their asses off. Anyways it's a great place just seems like a no brainer to close the door on a below freezing day so your customers are more comfortable."

                "description": "I like this location although the building could use a massive upgrade at this stage. The staff is attentive, the beer selection is dope, and having a traditional low key sports bar on the south side has been great. The food trucks that are adjacent never seem to be open when I come but the walk up Brooklyn Pie Co. is a game changer. All in all if you are a south sided looking for sports and cools beer with friendly service Little Woodrow's south is a safe bet. Just don't expect Bella and whistles. That's not what they do."

                "description": "Near the end of the day I had to take my mother to the emergency room (never fun).  The outcome was a good one, but the day was long.  My son and I decided to wind down at Little Woodrow's. Temp was in the 30s that night, but they have a really big and nice fire pit outside.    We arrived around midnight:30 on a Monday and the crowd was light and fairly quiet.We sat in a booth not far from the door (but also not far from the bar).  Only one bartender that night so the wait seemed a little long, but there was really no reason for them to staff two bartenders on a Monday evening.    Drinks were good, conversation was easy (no need to yell at each other because the crowd wasn't loud), and the place was nice and clean (restrooms too).  This was my first visit to Little Woodrow's, but I'd go back :-)"

I'll tell you which ONE, Woodrows Southpark Meadows because they are adding  club  soda  to  their whiskey so therefore they use the illusion of giving you a decent serving. It's just a serving of club and a 1/2 shot of whiskey. News flash that's not part of the recipe... It is essentially orange pill to wipe around the rim, whiskey Pour  over an ice ball/block, bitters and then it's not meant to be shaken it's meant to be stirred   Yuck!"

                "description": "Since I am the Yelp duchess of the UFC gym in Southpark meadows, I had to check out the UFC gym sponsored event at Little Woodrow's. As a side note, Cowboy Harley Davidson also co-sponsered the event. There was give aways and a chance to ride on a bike (it was stationary). I had a chance since I know the manager at UFC, to put my skills to the test and throw on some gloves and do some of my kick ass kickboxing moves. However, having been maybe drunk/heavily buzzed at the time this happened, I was more concerned of not falling on my ass and less concerned on my actual technique.   I honestly a little excited for this event because I really couldn't wait to see some of the UFC fights on the fight card. Plus I got a chance to check out Little Woodrow's since it is close to my house.   Overall Little Woodrow's is a dive bar. They don't serve food and it is strictly about the booze. You can order from the pizza place next door but if you read my review of that place I would recommend getting food else where.   Anyway, the bar also had a dusty dirty chiller machine with jager and whiskey fireball bottles chilled and ready for shots. I will say they need to clean that fan that keeps it cool before it catches on fire. haha This bar was great for watching the fights since they have multiple TVs and a huge big screen that comes down."

I've warmed up to it quite a bit. From what I can tell, it operates really well and you're gonna get consistency.  Things of note: - Large patio space with plenty of seating and TVs - I don't really care for sportsball, but they play all the big games, matches, etc. and a lot of people turn out to watch, and the community is just *fun* - Open mic standup on Mondays (it's not terrible usually!) - Attentive bartenders; have twice seen them taking care of too-inebriated patrons. - Good food truck, also have popcorn (from a local place) - Very regulated with last call and when you have to finish your drink by. They will be open at the posted hours. - Patrons can get a little crazy but they're almost always friendly.  A solid bar, by far the best in Southpark Meadows."

It might have been racially fueled as I was the onlyHispanic person sitting at the table. Nobody else's was asked to re show ID and we're able to receive service. I will never come back and I urge you to spend your money elsewhere. The staff is as unprofessional and rude as they come. They ruined my night along with everyone I was with.

Tuesday night is \"big beer night\", which means that 22 oz drafts are the same price as 16 oz drafts.  Cool.  I drank  3 22oz lone star drafts.  Pints of lone star are 3.00, so, i was a little surprised when my tab was over $13.  I asked about it, and was told that lone star was different.  This had me start doing Math.  Apparently, on normal nights, 16Ox is $3, while 22oz is 5.50.  Your paying almost $.07 more per ounce on a 22oz glass than on a pint.  Even with the minimal discount of \"big beer night\", you are STILL paying more per ounce on a 22oz beer than on a 16oz beer.  Way to screw your customers  LW.  You now have one less customer."

Their happy hour is pretty great. Still, I never stay longer than an hour, because as I mentioned, it is _toxic_ bro city up in this bar, unfortunately.  As for their food, their poutine is delicious. As is their Wisconsin Wurst, and honestly most of their sandwiches are up to par. The bar staff are always kind and helpful.

                "description": "On the whole I was sadly a bit disappointed in the quality of food and experience at Haymaker.  On the experience, their mobile web UI is very dated and not fully functional: we ordered online for in-restaurant pickup, and never received a confirmation via phone or email that our order had been placed. After waiting some time, I went inside to check on our order status, and they indicated it had not been received. Slightly inconvenienced, I placed the same order again in person. A few minutes later, the server let me know that the web order had, in fact, come through, and that they were producing one order and a separate, duplicate order. I asked them to cancel the original order placed through their mobile website, but their system does not allow for reversal of web orders. I had the in-person order reversed, having encountered friction while attempting to simply place an order at several steps along the way.  On the food, their grilled chicken sandwich was substandard quality at best. The meat was rubbery, and the secondary ingredients (lettuce, tomato, pickles, bun) were of pretty transparently low quality. I'm open to giving it another shot, but the first-time experience was, all things considered, an unfortunate one."

                "description": "Been here a couple of times pre covid and once fairly recently. Their outdoor space is a great spot to hang out and watch a game with plenty of tvs and well spaced out tables. They have reopened for indoor dining but when I went in to use the bathroom the space between fairly crowded tables was definitely too close for comfort.   In terms of food they have a pretty nice variety of out there sandwich/burger options along with typical bar fare. While I appreciate the variety I've found most of the food I've tried to be okay at best. Most recently I've tried the wings and Italian hoagie. The wings were super bready and the sauces weren't very flavorful. The roast beef and sausage on the hoagie were also both fairly bland.   They have some pretty solid drink specials (when I last went on a Tuesday all Texas beers were 3$) and compared to similar spots they have a really wide selection of options.   Overall, I think the vibe here is great and the drink deals are hard to beat. But between the less than stellar food and questionable crowd control I can't say I'd recommend coming by in the near future."

We were looking for somewhere to enjoy lunch on a weekday afternoon and this place enticed us because of the pool tables on the google pictures, however this was inaccurate and they didn't have any type of games.  The place looked pretty cool so we weren't all that upset about the pool table. We got seated right away and it was very much a bar setting, for those who couldn't tell. The service was honestly not great. Out waiter seemed very impatient and just ready to get off the clock. When asking about the size of the food the waiter over represented the food and it turned out really small.   Overall I wasn't very pleased with my experience and wouldn't come back given the chance."

This obviously happens in restaurants and it wasn't a huge deal. However it was how the manager handled it that really was top notch. He went above and beyond to make sure my experience was a perfect one. He bought me a beer and was so nice. The server was great too. It's all about recovery and even my husband said that's how a manager should handle a situation when something happens. I was very impressed and of course we will be back! Thanks to haymaker for going above and beyond to ensure our visit was a fantastic one! My one suggestion is to have a wing sauce that is super spicy! I would eat there every day!  Great place."

                "description": "Management has hung it's staff out to dry yet again on a big soccer day.   Went in for the Euro2020 Final on Sunday early enough to get a seat. We had no issue getting our food order and first beers as it was still not packed in there 1.5hrs priort to game time. But low and behold, as soon as we ordered our pitcher about 15-20min before game time we essentially stopped getting any drinks and had to go up to the bar ourselves to get them. This wasn't our waitresses fault as the bar staff was so backed up and the entire place was packed shoulder to shoulder with people probably doubling what the fire code actually allows in there.  When I finally fought through the crowd and went up to the bar, during the second half, I had to bring with me my empty pitcher as they had apparently ran out of ones to use. (Ours was empty for about an hour on our table). I started out about four people deep when I got up to the bar and first thing I saw was a bartender pull about 35-40 tickets off the machine from orders that were rang in. (That also happened the next time I came up). That's how I know it wasn't the staffs problem. They were set up for failure by being overwhelmed with people. Haymaker NEVER has someone making sure they don't go over capacity, so it's just a free for all of people.   I honestly have been just a handful of times in the past seven years since the Fire Marshall shut the place down during the USA/Portugal World Cup game in 2014. And they kicked me and my friends out from our table despite getting there 6+hrs prior to game time and going through a shift change. It's amazing they don't get shut down every big soccer match. Thought maybe they'd learned their lesson but clearly they haven't.  Gave it two stars because the wings were good and our server did what she could. Management just sucks so bad. All you need is some form of a doorman to keep this place from getting out of control. That's it, but they won't do it. So the experience sucks."

I stopped in during the week with no preconceived notions or ideas of what to expect. So what did I learn? Its a cool little craft beer bar with some great food items.  The night we came in they had a distributor there handing out all kinds of marketing swag, stickers and such. It wasn't pushy at all it was just laid back and I loved it.  The beer list now that is a headache - there's so many choices! OMG :)  It's around the corner for me and I have already stopped in about 3 times. Each visit has been the same for me - just perfect.  So far it isn't log jammed with crowds of people which I enjoy being able to sit without the typical ATX line w/a 20 min or more wait. Let's hope they are busy enough to stay around but not too much that I can't sit right away! ;)  Thanks for the great local vibe you put on guys. I love it!"

I realllllly wanted to try the soft pretzel because reviews were good and it looked amazing! The first few bites while it was hot were so good, but as it cooled off and I became satiated, it was just alright. I wouldn't be surprised if the cheese sauce that came with it was the same as the sauce on their macaroni and cheese. I think it tasted familiar. I gave the tomato soup another try, and it was just alright too. It's got a funny tangy metallic aftertaste. House pickles were fresh and interesting but I could only eat so much before they became overpowering. This time they included beets, green beans, and okra. I checked on their spiciness and was told they had a kick, but it wasn't too bad for me. I hate to say that the best thing I had was a free piece of Halloween candy from the bar. I really want to like this place. The owner was there most evenings and is friendly. However the food never meets expectations and is a little pricier than I'd consider appropriate."

The bar was sparsley populated for a Saturday night, though they did have a live band playing.  I got a Founders Solid Gold beer for $5.50 and ordered the pork belly hoagie for $12. The food came out pretty quick, but it felt like the kitchen staff wanted to get ouf of there and kind of rushed it together. It was just OK, not the kind of food I'd expect from a 4.5* establishment.  Nothing really wrong with the place, but I don't see how the ratings are so high. Perhaps there's people living in the building and they're just pleased to have a better than average bar in their building? I don't live here, so I don't know if I'll ever make it back in.  Bottom line: good bar, but so many bars in Austin, it didn't grab me as anything amazing."

                "description": "We were walking around on what was quite possibly the rainiest weekend this year so far and went to another place which had a 30-45 minute wait time. We walked around thinking we'll have to go back to our friend's apartment and drive somewhere when we ended up at this place purely by happenstance.   The good, the bad, and the ugly:  The good: The presentation of the food is so pleasing to the senses. Just as pleasing as it is to look at it, it is equally pleasing to your taste buds. I substituted my chips for the beets and oh boy, what a great a choice that was! The guy taking the order (Oh, btw, you have to order at the bar) told me that some people don't like them because they taste too earthy. I have never understood how people cannot enjoy eating beets. The highlight of the entree was supposed to be the portobello mushroom burger served on a bed of creams with some guacamole and aioli but the side of beets totally took the center stage. The vinaigerette they were sitting in when mixed with the cheese totally elevated the dish and give it so much dimension once you really mix it in together. You really want to take pictures and tell your food that this one is for the gram. I'll let the photos speak for themselves  The bad: Portions are a little bit on the smaller side but that could possibly be because we have huge portions in Houston. Or that I have a food addiction. No one else seemed to have that problem so you can just ignore the last statement. But, the service was a little lacking even though the restaurant was pretty empty.   The ugly: This does not necessarily apply to me but my friend is a vegan and they don't carry soy milk. Their reasoning, we put it out but no one used it and we were throwing it away. Solution could be, just give it to people who ask for it?!  I think, overall, we had a really good time over here. The food was great. On Sundays, they have live music where we were told that the music doesn't get so loud that you are not able to hold a normal conversation."

Parking is street and WiFi available. Free music co Stanton with a stage literally in the corner ready to go on short notice. Specials daily and happy hour until 7pm on Tuesday through Thursday. Food looked good but I was here for the beer. Fresh draft line makes me happy so no complaints here. One TV and friendly service. Floor and tables clean and although loud it's not in your head intrusive. Really can't ask for much more from a neighborhood bar."

                "description": "Rolled in here for the first time on Saturday afternoon and had my eye on their reuben. I was NOT disappointed! They brine their corned beef for 11days and it is juicy, crumbly perfection! The kraut they use is actually on par as well, w/the perfect balance of sweet and sour.  I am not gonna lie, the reuben here might just hold a candle to my all-time ATX fav at Waller. They are different stylistically, but both hold their own.  While I was here Saturday, I did their little sampler pour of one of my fav high abv beers, Wake up Dead on nitro by Left Hand. It was just what I wanted. At 10.2%, doing a full pour is a bit much, but their little $3 sampler was perfection.   I also discovered their \"Wine Wednesdays\" during my Saturday visit and after the gracious bartender Phil (who I have affectionately nicknamed \"GreenBay\") let me sample their 1000 Stories Bourbon Barrel Aged Zin. I was smitten from first whiff and in full lust after the first sip. I knew I had to return to make a half price $44 btl mine!  As luck would have it, my schedule allowed me to come in on the following Wed. I am not going to lie, I was so looking forward to doing damage to a bottle of a 1000 Stories all by my lonesome. However, because my \"luck\" has always been spelled w/a capital \"F\", they had just sold their last btl of 1KStories when I walked in. I was heartbroken. But, the wonderfully empathetic staff here not only let me sample the Substance Cab (it was a lovely cab, but I had my heart set on the BB-aged Zin!) before offering me a glass from the last open btl at HH pricing. GreenBay even let me kill what little remained at the end of the night. Great service will always make or break any experience, in my opinion.  It was busier than usual due to it being ATX Beer Week, but even the patrons at this place were gracious. There was not a seat to be had in the house and this kind man at the bar let me have the very tightly squeezed-in seat next to him.  BTW, the reuben here is so nice I had to have it twice! It was just as perfectly delicious the 2nd time as it was the first.  I will definitely be back the next chance I get for another attempt at Wine Wednesday and anytime I need an old school reuben fix. So glad I discovered this place, its vibe, and wonderful staff!"

I visited not too long ago and had their eggs benedict for Sunday brunch which was nothing short of amazing. He ordered the Hi-Hat plate which he also enjoyed. We ate and marveled at the talented jazz band that was finishing up their set. This place is cozy, has an enormous selection of beer, and a knockout menu for you to explore (with daily specials). I would come here again and again.  10/10 would recommend this place to others."

                "description": "First off, we wasn't planning to come here but looked what was in the area and this place popped up. When you go in, the area is a bit small. You can grab a menu off the wall and then order from the bar. They have a few chairs for bar seating and about 6 tables inside varying from a two seater to a six seater, and there are about 3-4 tables outside and then a bar top around the patio. If it is pretty warm, I would definitely recommend sitting inside. They said that this was the busiest they'd been so food took longer to come out than usual 30 min-1 hour. It was definitely worth the wait! I ordered the eggs Benedict with a cilantro sauce on top and it had chorizo as well! It was greatly prepared and was the perfect amount of food. The biscuits and gravy are also pretty darn good! You can pick how you want your eggs with it, and it also comes with bacon. We only did self serve water, but our total was $26...in the halfway mark price range. WORTH IT THOUGH! The staff are polite and try to do everything to accommodate you and keep up with other customers/work. The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the seating inside, making it hard to fit everyone!"

The owner greeted us and came over to chat...really nice guy with a lot of well deserved pride in his establishment. We ordered 4 appetizers as a meal. THEY WERE HUGE!!! Easily could have just had two! Everything was delicious. Their pretzels are the best I've ever had, taco was amazing... it was all great. Excellent beer selection on tap, and good live music too!"

Can't say that I've ever had chorizo in my Egga Benedict so that was interesting. I'm not sure if I love it but it's def decent. I'll have to say the mac n cheese stole the show hands down. I added it to my order after the bartender and another customer both recommended it. I don't normally eat mac n cheese but I'd def order theirs again!"

When I finally did get another beer ordered they forgot it four times. That is not an exaggeration. FOUR times.

They did also have space heaters but not too many. There is also a covered outdoor area but no heaters under those. They have tons of tvs so a perfect place to watch a game. The indoor part of the bar is tiny. Definitely don't go there if you want to be inside. From what I saw there was no lawn games like other Little Woodrow's like cornhole. I think I did see a ring game but that was all. They have multiple bars however during the day only the inside one was open. I loved the vibe though, really chill and perfect to be in the feel of Austin. The best part was the food truck there One Taco. This is the only food there in comparison to the ones in San Antonio with full menus. Would definitely come back!"

Mis that with the porch outside with a view of 6th street and it a great place to spend an early evening"

The place was full enough, but wasn't exceptionally packed like many other spots on this street, making for a more relaxed vibe. Their creamy orange frozen drinks were a dream, and we had several, served up by a friendly and unpretentious bartender. We look forward to coming back on our next trip."

We love the vibe here and you can always quickly score a strong pour even when they are busy.  During SXSW we figured it would be wall-to-wall and we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar area pretty empty (the patio area was jammed). We scored a nice side booth that was great for people watching.  They do have some decent beers available and if you have the munchies there is a food truck on site. Good pours and a good vibe..."

I knew I had about 15 minutes so I thought it would be the perfect chance to catch up on social media and drink something local.  I got a local hefe ($7). It was really good. Super friendly staff. The bar is cool - kinda divey and just really chill. I took a seat outside in the little patio and the pizza folks will actually bring the pizza in for you - clutch."

Every time I have been here it has not been overly crowded which is a good thing. We came here on a late Saturday afternoon and we were all able to get seats at the bar so we could laugh and talk to each other. I'm one of those picky people I can't drink well drinks and majorly batched sugar stuff so I asked if he could make me a skinny margarita. The The cute bartender said we usually do not have time to make skinny margaritas, but since I'm not so slammed I will gladly make one for you. He made a really good one. I am a big fan of his. My brother and his pals really liked the whip drink, a specialty frozen drink that is orange and super delicious looking."

Great burgers, wings, and shared plates. I would recommend the buffalo burger and crispy red potatos. The meat and cheese charcuterie is delicious too."

I actually braved the cold and sat outside admiring all the twinkly lights they had up, along with the cute hipster boys sitting at various tables smoking .   I still can't get over the fact that the drinks were so cheap here. Definite plus in my book. Having a pizza place next door made it even better. Service here is awesome.

Will the bartender put on the football game your friends request?  The answer to those was no, but What can you do. You're not gonna please everyone, and seeing how this was 30 people, a third of which I didn't even know, I could care less about them. My friends were happy. That bartender could have put on the Giants game though.   Nice bar, with a great selection of drafts. The outdoor patio in the back was perfect for the evening, catching the sun as it was going down. You can even order pizza from the food truck out front. I know it's off to pizza in Austin, being from New York, but I was craving something small and satisfying. Plus it was night one of many. I needed to keep room for the rest of the vacation."

                "description": "I am from the midwest, I also recently went to Nashville, so I have tried good BBQ...but THIS spot was next level.  Everything here was FANTASTIC.  From the service to the food this was a 10/10 experience.    A friend who used to live in Austin recommended this spot and I couldn't be more grateful.  I came here for lunch on a Sunday before my flight out of Austin.  Upon arrival we were greeted by the host and, after we were seated, given warm mini corn bread muffins - WOW, I mean I would come here JUST for these...so delicious, and such a hospitable touch.  My friend and I wanted to share an array of item, so we ordered the two meats BBQ plate with 2 sides.  We chose the potato salad, cider braised JBQ collards, and we added a side of the mac and cheese (we just had to try it).  For the meats we got the Texas brisket and the fennel and coriander crusted pork rib.  The food came out fairly quickly and we dug in...after the camera took the first bite ;)  The food was INCREDIBLE....I can't even think of a word to describe how EXCELLENT this BBQ was...the pork ribs were out favorite but the brisket was sooo tender and delicious.  The sides were out of this world...I mean if I had to ask for a last meal, this one might be it... the mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful, the collard greens weren't overcooked or mushy, they were the perfect savory flavor and consistency.  I will say, the potato salad was good BUT if I had to only pick two sides in the future I wouldn't go with it again.  It was pretty basic and I am not always a fan of the large red potatoes in a potato salad.  The house made pickles that are included in the meal were a delicious way to round out our meal.  Compliments to the chef - the food here is something I will dream about.  If you aren't convinced already - you should ABSOLUTLEY add lamberts to your list if you are visiting for the weekend or become a regular if you live in Austin.  Next time I visit, I hope to make it for one of their live music dinner events, but just a lunch here was a treat in itself."

While I am use to a nice moist brisket, I got a very fatty cut, highlights were the greens and cornbread.  The building was nice and it seemed like a popular business lunch spot but I was expecting top notch smoked meats.  Really did not tasty the coriander and fennel in the ribs although the meat quality and smoke ring was present.

Luckily, there were bar seats available for 2. I can see why! The bbq shops around this one (just a couple) were out of favorable meats so this is the only spot that has all the selections on the menu and stays quite late open.   Their bbq meats, such as brisket and baby back ribs, were savory to delve into, moist and delightful! Service was superbly attentive! I adore their collard greens. Other bbq shops only serves up coleslaw and maybe string beans. Yum!   Housemade bbq sauces, went along with the meats!   For what it is as bbq dining meshed with fine setting, it is appealing here, surely!"

The portions were very filling with a Chips and Queso and 3 Meat Platter easily filling up two adults.  Kinda wish they had more BBQ meat types available at lunch (beside other sausages).  Chipotle Queso with Burnt Ends: This appetizer so filling, it's almost like a light meal.  The queso isn't your typical microwaved Velveeta, but some sort of yummier in-house blend.  And then they toss in a bunch of BBQ meat with a nice drizzle of BBQ sauce.  There were some freshly made flour tortillas on the side, which were perfect to wrap up some cheese dipped meat.  And the thick fried corn chips were great for soaking up cheese alone.   Prime Texas Brisket: Definitely the best meat I tried here.  Thick, tender, fatty, meaty.  All the perfect things BBQ could be.  I kinda like the mustardy sauce pairing with this one more than the sweet sauce, but it's actually very tasty by itself.  Fennel and Coriander Crusted Pork Ribs: Felt a tad over salted / over smoked.  It tasted jerky-like and had a firmer Chinese spareribs texture.  I prefer when pork ribs have the meat almost falling off the bone and are primarily infused with just a subtle smoky flavor.  Texas All Beef Hot Link: Lots of nice spices in this.  Not as complex as the brisket or ribs, since it's basically just a sausage.  But really good for a sausage.  Baked Mac and Cheese: Loved how creamy and flowing the cheese sauce was.  The al dente pasta did a great job carrying that cheese sauce.  Sadly, no gratinéed cheese on top like fresh out-of-the-oven mac and cheese.  But the breadcrumbs gave it nice texture.  Ranch Style Borracho Beans: Hardy pinto beans.  Lots of good sauce, which seemed tomato-centric.  Some subtle sweet tones."

                "description": "My friends and I went to Lamberts on our first night in Austin, in search of a great entry to barbecue in Texas! I'm a little bummed to say Lamberts missed the mark for us.   As far as the location itself, it was a generally nice building and it was really great that they had reservations available (when many barbecue places often don't). However... when arriving at the restaurant, our table wasn't ready at our reservation time so we ended up waiting for 15-20 minutes. Not really the end of the world, but it was a little disappointing, and the staff recommended that we get drinks at the bar... which would be great if there was space to hang out by the bar or in the waiting area.   Onto the actual food and drink experience: the drinks were solid and we all tried various cocktails and didn't have any bad experiences there. The food itself is one of my bigger qualms with Lamberts -- quality is OK but quantity is really not there for what you're paying. I understand the appeal of an upscale barbecue restaurant, where the ambiance is nice and you can get a table indoors, but it just didn't seem like you were remotely getting your value for money here with the food (both the main dishes and the entrees). Portions are small, and the quality is *just* ok, especially compared to some of the more notorious barbecue spots in Austin (which provide better taste and quantity for less $$).   Service was solid and the staff was nice overall -- they made their best efforts to overcome any challenges of the evening.   In general, I'll say you can probably find a better barbecue spot in Austin than Lamberts if you're really looking for good taste and good value for money. if you're really looking to get the ambiance of a cozy restaurant and get some decent (but expensive) barbecue, Lamberts could work just fine for that purpose."

                "description": "My new favorite barbecue restaurant in Texas... and high up on my list of date night spots... wha?? I walked into this beautiful historic building, sat in a beautiful leather booth, saw the prices and thought, \"we must be paying these crazy bbq prices for the rent and decor.\" I couldn't believe 4 oz of only brisket was $29!  But goddamn, it is the best damn brisket I've ever had. The brisket is in the same vein as Killen's fatty brisket in Pearland. Whereas Killen's brisket is essentially fat with some beef marbling, Lamberts' is mostly beef but with that same fois gras-like soft, succulent decadence. Goddamn it is so brilliant.  Also the best cole slaw I have ever had in my life! And the \"best queso I've ever had,\" according to hubby. And the best upside down peach cake... and the best service--thank you, Erin! The more i swallowed, the more I became a believer--upscale barbecue, y'all... Those days of standing outside in hostile lines for hours only to be served cafeteria style may be over y'all..."

                "description": "Happy hour here is such a great deal! From 5-7pm, Tuesday's through Saturdays, a selection of their appetizers are discounted. I got the crispy wild boar ribs, the frito pie, the red snapper ceviche, and the bbq clams.  The boar ribs were prepared like Buffalo wings; there was even blue cheese. The frito pie was shockingly good, I really liked the brisket buried underneath the mountain of frito chips and sour cream. The red snapper ceviche was served in a glass that was annoying to eat out of, and it was good but not the best version of ceviche I've had. The BBQ clams in white wine sauce was interesting and I liked the sourdough bread in it, but I'm realizing I just don't like clams very much.  Regardless, all of the dishes were done well. Service was also excellent - they start you off with jalapeño cornbread, and end you off with wet hand towels."

                "description": "My husband and I ate here for a dinner date tonight. We were a little nervous about eating indoors, but the staff did a good job of spacing tables and wearing masks.   The food was incredible! We had ceviche, brisket, Mac and cheese and the 3-meat plate. I was a little fussy about paying this much for bbq (it's a tad on the spendy side) but it was worth it. Completely delicious food.   There was a little side of sauerkraut that came with the 3-meat plate that I could eat every day. It was as good as kraut I have had in Germany and perfect with the sausage.  Beware of the carrots on the side of the bbq plates. They are tasty but SUPER spicy.  We found the atmosphere a bit noisy and there were several larger parties where heavy drinkers were getting a little out-of-hand, which was a bit of a damper on the date night vibes. Parking was also a little tricky, but typical for downtown: either street or garage.   We did have reservations via Open Table which I would recommend because they were pretty busy.   We appreciated the clean atmosphere, friendly staff, curated cocktail menu, happy hour specials until 7 PM, and delicious food."

                "description": "FIRST TIME AND LAST! THE PORTION, TASTE,  AND PRICE ARE A TOTAL MISS. $34.00 AND NO SIDES? NEXT.   My first time in Austin, and we were looking for some great bbq. Well, I thought I had found it and I'm super sad this place Moses the mark. Who pays 52.00 for a plate with two sides? Let's get into this. . .   PROS: HAPPY HOUR MENU is the biggest pro! If you're a light eater like myself, happy hour menus can really help to try things in a way smaller portion. Pro #2-I had a reservation for two, and it ended up being for 3. There was no drama, or extra wait. The customer service was a 10/10! Most places get really upset about changing reservations (no idea why? More money is a great thing lol) so I'm glad this place didn't.   CONS: THE PORTION. THE PRICE. NO SIDES. I don't mind when food is expensive, just please be worth it. At Lucilles bbq it's 36.00 for 3 meats and two sides ;enough to feed TWO) . Here, it's 3oz of 2 meats and 1 sausage and 0 sides for 34.00. What the hell? Just like all the other comments stated, the food was not worth the price. We got 2 \"table sides\" which is 18.00 tacked onto the 34.00. I'm paying 52.00 for something that's usually $35.00. No thanks. Now let's get to how the food tastes. .   FOOD: 1/10.  Mac and cheese: The Mac and cheese was crispy? No cheese? Not wet inside, and HARD. -10! Beans: 9/10- the beans were amazing. But 9.00 for a tiny bowl? What the hell, lol.  3 meats plate: rib- 1/10 jalapeño sausage: 2/10 brisket 9/10. The only thing worth getting on this plate was the brisket. It was really tender and amazing.  Starter: Queso dip-The queso dip that was truly amazing and literally the only thing worth getting at this restaurant.   All around. I will never come back. I wish we would've spent this money at a different place. I get they're trying to do upscale bbq, and it totally missed the mark. There was nothing special or different that was worth the price or taste while having a vacation type dinner. The ambiance was the only thing that I can truly say was special on this visit."

Food was alright, we got the three meat sampler - brisket, choice of sausage and prime rib. Also got 2 sides: baked Mac and cheese which was delish and collard greens which tasted good at the time but caused an upset stomach for both of us. I was throwing up collard greens all next day.  One of the hostess was also really rude to us and cleared our plates away without asking and we weren't done with the food! Probably good thing considering it was contaminated."

This is a very nice establishment.  The service was excellent and the food was even better.    The host recommend I try the sampler, which consisted of a pork rib, beef hot link and their brisket.  I added a side of collard greens and mac and cheese.  Let me tell you, this was probably the best brisket I've ever had!  So moist and smokey.  The greens and mac were awesome as well.

                "description": "I hadn't been to Lamberts in years, but I visited last week for a dinner with colleagues when we were in Austin for a work conference. We were treated to a plated dinner, so we didn't order from the regular dinner menu. But everything was delicious - from the fried pickle spears to start to the two great and creative salads to the sides and, of course, the meats. We tried the fried pickles, heirloom carrots and avocado salad, iceberg wedge salad, baked mac and cheese, jalapeno lime and garlic roasted broccoli, Texas prime brisket, country style pork ribs, and achiote and lime brined half chicken. No complaints. I wish I could have gone back the next night to eat more without the set menu, because it was so good. The restaurant is cool, and the service was good. The location is right downtown, so we were able to walk from our conference hotel. There is nothing I do not like about Lamberts. I want it again now just thinking about it. When a BBQ place is making memorable sides, salads, and CHICKEN in addition to great traditional BBQ meats (like brisket and sausage and ribs), you know it's special. If you're looking for an upscale, delicious, foodie BBQ dinner - check out Lamberts."

We were sat pretty close to the stage, but even if we were further away it still would have been okay. Acoustics were great and the show was more of an imitate setting. We ordered the 3 meat plate to share between the two of us. Make sure you get some sides as well, since it doesn't come with any.   Three meat sampler: A sampling of Prime Brisket (very tasty), Pork Ribs (too much fat) and Sausage (excellent! I wish we had more of this). The meats came with sauces to dip in. It was nice to have a variety of sauces to choose from.  Baked mac n cheese: This side was okay. It was decent mac n cheese, but I wouldn't get it again.  Mashed Yukon gold potatoes: My favorite of the meal. Nice and cheesy with a dollop of sour cream. Definitely when great with all the meats.  Overall, good food, good drinks, and a really nice spot to start off our Austin trip!"

We got the brisket, mashed potatoes, baked mac, 3 meat sampler, and queso with burnt ends.  The queso was probably the most disappointing, because it was really nothing special. The burnt ends don't really add much more to the queso, and there was so little that at first I didn't even realize the queso was supposed to have the burnt ends in it. Wouldn't recommend. The mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives was also pretty average. It was bland and nothing special. The baked mac and cheese, however, exceeded expectations. It wasn't too dry, and was actually really flavorful!  I think the saving grace was the meats. All of the meats were so good! I would definitely rank this spot as a good BBQ place in Austin. The meats were juicy, tender, flavorful, and not over-cooked. But, everything came in really small quantities (including the queso and other sides), and cost quite a lot for such a small amount.  Over all, this place is good (I'd just stick with the BBQ though, and maybe try different sides). But, just be prepared to pay a lot for not too much food."

                "description": "Touchdown Austin. My objective? Hit as many BBQ spots over the course of three days as I possibly can (it turned out to be five of them) and see how they stack up. First up was Lamberts, and while this wasn't the rustic pit-centered setup that you might expect when you hear Texas barbecue, the goods delivered nonetheless.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Lambert's is actually a pretty swanky sit down spot following what I hear is a recent remodel, and they tether a comfortable environment with fantastic service that's lightning quick. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Sitting down comes at a bit of a cost that's incremental even to the existing premium placed on Austin BBQ, and the result was $21.00 for what must have been about a half pound of brisket with some peppers and onions, two slices of bread, and a selection of housemade barbecue sauces. That's expensive, but not as much if you're expecting sit down prices and execution. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  I was told by Brian, my genuinely out of this world server, that Lambert's brisket can stand by itself, and I found that... almost to be true. Good flavor? Yes. Great consistency that balanced fat with lean? Yes, but the one place lacking here was the crust, which was thin and without much of a punch. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?  Strictly for their brisket and nothing more maybe not, but Lambert's is very much serving a need in providing good barbecue in a sit down environment where you're not going to walk out of there smelling like smoke and meats. Star."

The fried shrimp appetizer on HH was best dish with huge plump shrimp freshly fried crispy. Queso with burnt ends was okay (with fried corn chips and warmed flour tortillas) is decent but only found 1 small piece of and a couple of strands of brisket.  Bbq was decent but $26 for 1/2 lb brisket albeit good bbq is quiet high and the link sausage was not good. Mushy and not warm enough so no juices and flavor was so so. Fish was decent but at $38 needed to be better. Mac n cheese was good but not creamy nor crispy enough on top to justify the $9 price. Collard greens were a standout and well balanced flavor (best I've had in a while). Cornbread came complimentary at beginning of meal and were warm and cheesy and densely excellent.  Server, Ava, had great attitude, friendly and prompt. The experience is elevated here and silverware (not often found at texas bbq places) was changed before entrees and hot wet hand towels brought after instead of the typical plastic enclosed. towelettes."

The minute you open the door to this establishment the scent of smoked meat hits your senses from every angle. Even the bread had a hint of smoke in it! I highly recommend this BBQ spot in Austin. Good to take someone out on a date. Do plan ahead and check for reservations...things will be a lot easier for you. I saw several people without reservations get turned around.

In the meantime, the full menu is offered. Nonetheless, we were attended to by Alfonso whom we discovered was as knowledgeable about the menu and beverages as he is passionate about the company. Their version of pimiento cheese is phenomenal. My fried pork chop was incredibly juicy, and Edwyn's salad was well thought out.  The new GM Josh stopped by to make sure everything was as it was supposed to be, which they certainly were. In a nutshell, this is an absolutely amazing place."

                "description": "*Update*.....Jack Allen's Kitchen on Anderson Ln is my go to eatery for fresh comfort food. They were doing farm to table before it was a foody phrase. Everything on their menu is excellent! Burgers and fries, fish tacos, salads and chicken fried steak are some of my favorites. These guys get it!!! They don't overthink their food and make the dishes something they're not. I often say, \"Simplicity is best served warm with a side of sweet potato fries.\" If you feel this way, Jack's is for you. In short, they prepare recognizable dishes with fresh ingredients at a good price point. I highly recommend Jack Allen's Kitchen for your next comfort food.culinary excursion. You simply will not find better food for the money anywhere in Central Texas. Run, don't walk, to any of their locations for great food."

An enormous amount of food and tasty. The steak was prepared perfect and was tender and flavorful. We even had pie for dessert. All the food was great. Plenty of places still struggling to have enough servers but our guy tried very hard and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Look forward to returning."

                "description": "We've been coming to Jack Allen's for their heavenly brunch for years now (hello, tomato basil pie!), and I'm beyond remiss to only be reviewing it now, when we're eating \"linner\" here for the first time! If my husband were a restaurant, he would be Jack Allen's. Classic. Stylish. Cool Cat Texan. 90's grunge rock comfortable. FYI that Jack also feeds Camp Mabry on the regular, so we're both definite fans! You'll never ever go wrong with their boozy Sunday brunch. Period.  But does that culinary wizardry extend to Sunday linner? Why, yes. Yes, it does!   Can I say straightaway that the Slow Braised Beef Barbacoa Enchiladas were slap yo mama yum? If you're in the market for southwestern comfort food, look no further! The slow braised beef was flawless, cheesy goodness! Diet food? No. Excellent food? Yes!  First things first, though! The House-Made Pimento Cheese with Flatbread Cracker amuse bouche was stupid good! If pimento cheese was on your childhood menu, like it absolutely was on mine, you'll find this starter profoundly soul-warming! We bought a mason jar full of the cheese to take home because como no?   The Crispy Chicken Lollipops appetizer was out of this world! Crispy sweet heat and the most tender chicken thighs on earth with a pile of Jack Slaw that we would buy by the pint! This would actually be a perfect entree size for me for next time! I'm filing this away!   The Chicken Fried Pork Chop is straight up Sunday dinner at Mom's! If your mom is a stellar chef, of course, which we all know that they all are, right? The masher and the gravy were a cashmere throw! Ridiculous! Just look at the picture, y'all! You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.   The drinks all go without saying! The chemists behind the bar are wicked good! My agave skinny cocktail was on point! I knocked back three. No judgement! Hubby's Moscow Mule was bracing and bright! He knocked back three! No judgement!   The Blondie pie? Best dessert ever! I really don't know what else to say about it! I'm without words, and my husband is currently apoplectic!   By the by, our server, Christian, was the pitch perfect Jack Allen guide! Jack Gilmore is lucky to have him! As were we!   p.s. We picked up the Jack Allen cookbook while we were there. Tomato Basil Pie, we shall bake you!"

We had the Barbacoa Stackers, guacamole, and catfish to start, and all of them were very tasty but not really great for splitting among a large group.  Didn't try dessert, and the drinks weren't bad just a little pricey to me. The entrees were lacking however, I split a plate of Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloin, and Pesto-marinated Crab Stuffed Chicken. Both dishes were fine I guess, but both were light on flavor. There was barely any chorizo or crab in the respective dishes.  Short version, I'd recommend the appetizers, but that's about all."

BARBACOA STACKERS $9.99- [barbacoa, refried black beans, jack cheese, JAK slaw, cotija cheese]  Comes w/ 3 stackers (basically large nachos), and it was a small meal for me.

The service is always good. The food is consistently good as well.  My only -1 is the food tends to be a little bland imo. Still good, just missing a kick, if that makes any sense. I've had many things off the menu now, chicken fried chicken, enchiladas, pasta, appetizers, etc. They're all good, but never my favorite. In fact part of the reason I've tried so many things is I'm looking for that ONE thing that makes me say \"let's go to Jack Allen's for dinner.\" But again, the food is good. I wouldn't hate on someone if they suggested we come here for dinner."

We did have reservations so we were promptly seated in Phoebe's section. Phoebe is an awesome Lead Waitress. She was bubbly, fresh, and friendly from the start. She was ready to answer any questions we may have had. Being and avid yelper, I had already skinmed that menu on the app from the passenger seat. We ordered the seafood crab dip as an appetizer. It left us wanting more.. the Ruby Trout I had was absolutely marvelous. The glaze, the light but complimentary seasonings are out of this world. Okay I'm blending my experiences because the food is that good.The 13 spice Blackened chicken pasta was OMG.. the pasta.. made FRESH in house, you could taste the freshness. I don't remember the last time I had such fresh pasta. The seasonings on the blackened chicken was good enough to have me slap everyone's mama. The julienne serranos as a nice presentation an the hot sauce recommendations from Phoebe didn't go unnoticed either. Can you tell I'm pleased? NEW FAVE."

Their portions are generous and priced accordingly. I also enjoy their cocktails, especially the Moscow mule. It's easy to place an order online for curbside, and parking is plentiful if you decide to dine-in. I've brought several out of town guests here, and even the pickiest of eaters has left satisfied."

I really dug the music as soon as I walked in and decided where my clan was planning to post up. That is always a good sign especially for me who thrives on good music + strong drinks.  Parking is limited but there is plenty of parking up and down the street along the fancy apartment condos. The street is lit up so I felt pretty safe with my car parked a little further down from the entrance of the bar.  Super chill crowd and vibes here from all staff and the patrons. I enjoyed sitting outside on the small but mighty picnic tables. It seats 4 super comfortably with a few friends who were able to stand at the end of the table to converse and use the bar top holder behind them to set their drinks on.  Love their french fries as they were thick and almost curly-esque? I also loved the long corndog they have on their menu too. Everything is made to order and came out piping hot!  Cool local bar that is off the beaten path. We came here after visiting a brewery down the street so we could enjoy some spirits and shots!   Looking forward to more hang outs here at Frazier's in the future!"

It's close to my neck of the woods. The spot is a little old school feeling, cool and chill. The drinks are good. The food is delicious! The tunes are rockin! The bartenders and door guy always seem to be on their game. Did I mention they also have Jell-O shots here ... yes, that's right! Go on and order one to start out your night right or heck, end your night! I love coming in here with my husband, sitting at the bar sipping a drink and ordering a corn dog or mini burger or fizzle fries with cheese  - it's all killer here.

It's the type of place you want to walk to after work is done and sit down with a drink and brush off the day.   There's loads of space inside and the people there seem to really enjoy it all.   The closest bar in town is Nickel City, they seem like sister spots. If you like one you'll love the other.   Food. They got that too and it's all the greasy fried nonsense you want at a bar when you're knocking back drinks. Corn dogs. Yup. They got em and they're damn good. Want a breakfast corn dog you ask? Yeah, got those too. So next time you want brunch head on over and grab some pancake batter dipped and fried breakfast sausage and dunk it in maple syrup and thank me. Totally worth it."

We had been searching for a new local bar that had food AND was dog friendly, and we definitely found it in Frazier's! They have an awesome retro vibe inside, with some vintage arcade games, a jukebox and pool table. The bar is long, with plenty of seating, and plenty of TV's with sports on. They also have a small outdoor patio which is smoker-friendly as well. We decided to order food after hearing everyone within earshot talking about their menu favorites, and it was the very best choice we made all day! The chili dog was huge, and although they say it's Cincinnati-style chili, it was not cinnamon-heavy like most are, which we appreciated! The wings were some of the best in town, and so meaty, and perfectly crisped. They came extra saucy automatically, so again, another win for Frazier's! The fries are something to write home about, let me tall ya, they are the thick, twisty, plump potatoes, which they sprinkle with their wing seasoning. Holy cow were they amazing! The drinks were cheap, the beer was cold, they had frozens, they have a super fun brunch menu, there literally isn't a single other thing we could have asked for in a bar! And the BEST part, they are completely dog friendly, both inside and out which is a total jackpot win for dog parents, and they even have treats behind the bar for your pups, with lots of love and attention to give!"

Barback that buttons one button at the bottom of his shirt is a hot-headed douche . I think he was irritated because his chain got stuck in his two chest hairs. Gonna drop some baby powder off for him. Front door guy with long hair chill. May bring a flask and hang with him in the lot. If you like a bar where everyone looks at you a bunch but doesn't serve anything but a side-eye... go here."

                "description": "Frazier's is big cold mugs of beer fantastic! Its dark its loud its enchanting. The bar has some cool vintage beer signs and artifacts for decor, custom pool tables and is all around classy in all the right ways.   The food served at Frazier's is bar food perfection. You'd be hard pressed to find a better corn dog and they've made classic greasy bar food like the patty melt relevant again. I've seen them insist that they are \"Making Patty Melts Great Again\" and I don't think you can prove them wrong.   Frazier's is also home to one of the best Thai style chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Which brings to point the unabashed diversity of the bar menu.   Take for example the \"Chopped Cheese\" sandwich served at Frazier's. A New York staple famed for its low cost at local bodega's. Finding one as authentic as the one served here (at least in Texas), is as far as I know impossible. They also continue to respect the heritage of the sandwich's low cost and sell it for only 5 dollars.   The staff at Frazier's is the most amazing and friendly group of folks you could ask for. Service is fast, friendly and delivers that everyone knows your name local bar feel that so many places strive for and never achieve.   Frazier's deserves nothing less than a perfect score, I cringe when I read reviewer Concerned C.'s review that refers to Frazier's as \"Hipster\". I cant help but imagine that for him to make such a misnomer he must not be hip enough to even identify what \"Hipster\" is. His statement that the TV's are never on only continues to reveal his ignorance (see attached photo of TV's on showing the game) shame on you Concerned C.  So I give Frazier's Five glowing stars, I'd give them six if it were an option and I look forward to spending many days eating chopped cheese and drinking from giant frosty mugs. Kudo's Frazier's Long and Low may you live long and prosper."

Was also told not to use the bar napkins to dry my hands after using the restroom, yet there were no paper towels in the restroom.

We had to sit outside of the restaurant because they were so busy (and it was a Monday night)- definitely recommend making a reservation. The waitress was so friendly! We started with the chips and dip, which were great. My husband and I split the roasted chicken and steak. Everything was so tasty. The kitchen was totally happy to modify their pepperoni pizza to be half cheese for the kids we had with us. Really great! They have a great cocktail menu as well. Just a note, the menu listed on their website right now doesn't match what they are serving."

For dinner, I highly recommend their handmade pizza (we tried pepperoni) and their salmon entree. Scrumptious!  We tried a few of their desserts and I'd rate them in the following order - chocolate cake (decadent!!!) , bourbon bread pudding (served with ice cream!) and their cheese cake (served with fresh peach slices).  Great ambiance and a lovely bar as well. I didn't try any alcoholic beverages but they make a mean virgin mojito!"

The waitress was really attentive, she informed us of different things on the menu, please see my pictures of the menu. I really enjoyed the tomato soup, this is not your regular Campbell's tomato soup, it was so creamy I love the croutons that was added, it was definitely very savory and sweet. I also enjoyed the apple cider wings, they were cooked to perfection, the meat was falling off the bone. I also enjoyed that they had hot tea and gave you a little bit of honey with it, and the honey is like a new jar That you can take home. Overall I would deathly come back here to try some more food, they also do to go and they will deliver to your room if you stay in the hotel."

Mostly business attire as it was people staying at the hotel. But you can come as casual as you wanted. It literally is in the lobby of the hotel.  One block from visitor center.

Just a few other people there do not busy at all. They offer a buffet or a menu.  I had the omelette and you can choose up to three items to have in it. Comes with a large side of potatoes and choice of toast.  It's an open kitchen so you can see and smell everything being made. The bacon had a real nice deep Smokey flavor to it ."

I started with the most scrumptious crab cakes that had many pieces of lump crab.    Follow that by pan roasted chicken on top of risotto and roasted carrots. You have a wonderful meal!!  I will say that the chicken was a bit gamie for me but it paired well with the corn, cheese risotto and roasted carrots.   I would definitely come back and try another entree on the menu."

                "description": "On a day to pick up our SXSW badges at the Austin Convention Center food was on our mind since it was lunchtime. Since we were located next to the Hilton Austin I remembered reading Cannon + Belle was very good.  So we walked inside and had no problem getting a table.  It was near 11:00 AM and our waitress notified us breakfast was ending and gave us two menus. I did not feel like eating eggs so I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and my wife got the Brisket Pizza from the breakfast menu.  The place is nice and uses gold ware.  It's bit of fanciness to match elegant drink ware.  I reminded me of my grandmother's with her luxury dinnerware.   Soon our food arrived and my chicken sandwich came with creole potato chips. It was a bit spicy, but my sandwich was very good and the chicken was fresh, soft and juicy.  I enjoyed the sandwich very much.  I looked over to my wife's huge pizza where it was covered with diced bbq and scrambled eggs in the center. I tried it of course and the bbq had a smoked taste, and the eggs were farm fresh.  I pretty much ate her eggs and some of the pizza crust which was very crunchy.  Our server was excellent and kept our drinks full.  This place definitely meet and exceeded my expectations."

He has a lot of options that will work for any occasion. For our group we had a certain set of things we wanted to accomplish and Michael put together a custom experience for us that 100% delivered.   Michael is fun, knowledgeable and professional. He was prepared with anything we could have asked for and when we asked for an audible he was able to accommodate with zero problems.   I think it's also worth mentioning that his bus is immaculate, new and comfortable. That's a big deal when you spend a couple days traipsing around TX.   Highly recommend Michael and Native Experience for your Austin adventures."

Michael picked us up at our airbnb in Austin and drove us out to Fredericksburg for the day.  This was such a great alternative to staying a night in Fredericksburg because we didn't need to drive.  We went to a couple of really unique spots and had a couple of hours to explore Main Street in downtown.  It was a fully custom tour based on what our group wanted to do.  Michael really made the experience - he was a super entertaining driver and had a ton of local knowledge about the area.  I would highly recommend a tour with Native Experience and would definitely do it again."

The burrata dish was very flavor full, I wish it would've come with some type of bread or crostini, I ordered it in the side and it definitely elevated the flavors.   The braised short rib was delicious, the flavor of the polenta was to die for, will certainly order again.   Strozzapreti was sadly incredibly oily and bland, it is advertised with 'Parmesan cream' which if the massive amount of oil was supposed to be that, that is sadly a miss.   All in all a pretty good experience, will attend in person next time!"

You call in for walk in wait times and they would tell you 45 mins and then when you go to the restaurant they would not let you sit. While relaying this information, the maitre d' is talking as if she is doing us a favor and yelling 'IT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE' - (oh like this is something we would not know) So we called 5 mins before going over to the place and they told us its 45mins wait and 5 mins later (when we reached the place) - they were no longer taking walk-ins.  If that wasn't enough- another maitre'd says they are no longer accepting party larger than 5.  Btw half the restaurant is empty visibly so. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know just on the basis of the attitude of maitre d' coz if you get such a service at the door - god knows what's happening inside the restaurant."

The others had chicken pesto, Squid Ink Malfadine and shrimp over pasta and shrimp scampi over pasta. It was one of the few Italian restaurants that is open for lunch on Sunday. They also have a small Sunday Brunch menu ias well. I highly recommend North Italia at both locations. The food is always fresh. The wine was pretty pricey by the bottle but, that is to be expected."

It was all so good. Later that night I was lying in bed craving more of those dang meatballs. For me you know it's good when you want more and a day hasn't even passed. The white truffle garlic bread is also a must. So much flavor! Service was great. The only thing that's weird about this location is that there isn't really a place to sit while waiting for a table unless you want to stand outside... which is fine as long as it's not freezing outside. It's not enough to take away a star because the food and drinks were fabulous."

These make the perfect meal. Everything on the charcuterie board pears so nicely with one another. The salad is crunchy and sweet, I didn't like kale before I ate this and now I'm obsessed, it's made just the right way. The tenderloin is always cooked to perfection. It pears amazing with the polenta (underneath beef in the photo) and the veggies that comes with it. I will recommend this place to everyone who comes to visit. The staff really takes the time to explain the menu and provides excellent service. I have had an enjoyable experience every time I've come here."

Some items are hit or miss but I typically order an app, pizza, and pasta to share between 3 and have enjoyed everything I've ordered after trial and error.   The Calamari is arguably the best appetizer they offer. It's cooked perfectly and sooo good with the lemon squeeze and arugula salad on top. Any pizza has always been delicious and my favorite pasta has probably been the Strozzapreti although it is super heavy and filling. I think the location at the Domain offers larger portions at the same price point so I would recommend that one over the Downtown location tbh.   Also, they do free birthday desserts! My friend ordered the butter cake and it was divine. We love their sangria as well and a pitcher is great for a table of 3 to share."

It is now 6pm and we are still waiting on the appetizers......the Domain location is run a lot  smoother. It seems that they may be under staffed however people seated after us were getting their food. Really bummed out about this location. Not coming back. UPDATE: it is now 6:20 pm; Apps came at 6:05 pm. Update: We got the rest of our meal at around 7:00 pm. They probably shouldnt take any reservations or as many people if they are understaffed. All in all the food was good. The waiter did apologie and was professional about it-but again it was frustrating seeing people being seated before us with no reservations and getting our food before us. They should at least give people bread to fill up on while waiting."

I used to live in LA, where it was highly recommended, and my experience there did not disappoint. Neither did it here in Austin either. All their food is local, so the menu items at each location are different. I learned that when I found that my favorite dish from LA wasn't on the Austin menu! It wasn't a problem though, because the other dishes I had here were just as good, if not better. This is one of those rare places where you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Throw a dart anywhere, and you'll be happy. We ordered the Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Garlic Bread, and Margherita Pizza, and all three were out of this world. If you're craving Italian, this is your place. 100%."

Weird that we couldn't get a reservation but happy that they take walk in... Good to know!  Very nice place. We really enjoyed our appetizers. Pastas and entree were good. Our service was very professional and patience. Great wine suggestions."

                "description": "From the service to the food--this place could use some serious improvements.  This was my first trip ever to Austin and I'd heard from almost everyone I know that Austin is known for the friendly people there, but this restaurant seems to be an exception to that.  We sat down here on a Friday afternoon and there were a few people at the bar but it was pretty empty overall. We seated ourselves at one of the many empty booths and proceeded to wait about 15-20 for someone to come take our drink order.  We saw a number of employees walking around talking to people at the bar, delivering food, but for whatever reason nobody came to us for some time after we sat down. That should have been the red flag that made us get up and leave but it didn't. We stayed and will likely never return for another meal.  I ordered the spaghetti that didn't come with spaghetti noodles which is fine typically but everything from the sauce to the meatballs was very bland and just not at all what I expected.   My partner ordered the meatball sub with fries and the fries are really the only thing saving this review from one star. I love a good French fry and theirs were perfect. They offer homemade ketchup which had a little kick to it and it wasn't bad. However, the meatball sub was just as underwhelming and bland as the spaghetti.  Our friends ordered cesar salad and pizza and some other sandwich (I can't remember which one, sorry). The salad had very dry chicken but everything else in it was fine. The pizza had prosciutto and arugula and figs on it and it was way too sweet for my taste buds and nobody else in the party seemed to really enjoy it either.  Food is pretty standard price--typical for a meal in the California where I live and I guess downtown Austin as well. $18 for the plate of spaghetti I got and it was not worth it at all.  If you want to spend $20 on one plate of food, go somewhere else."

Seasonal Veg Salad is filling especially if you had a protein, that and a shared app and you will definitely be satisfied.  Margherita Pizza can definitely be shared and is a great bang for your buck.   Great lunch or early dinner spot, make sure to get a table outside!"

My family has food allergies (celiac disease) and everyone is so kind and informative. The coffee is so smooth and absolutely divine. I actually bought a shirt awhile back because coffee from coffee Shark brings me so much stinking joy! I don't feel this way about any other local coffee shop! So grateful you are a part of Austin and I wish this business ongoing abundant success!!!"

                "description": "Pretty nice for a hidden coffee shop in a large commercial complex. Would not notice it from the road or walking past unless you know what you're looking for, as it blends in with the rest of the modern building architecture. Not the warmest building from the exterior, but they've done a good job trying to make it welcoming indoors. A variety of seating with one high top table. Most of the seating is 6+ capacity tables, so if you don't like sharing, this is not the place for you to study/sit alone. There is bench window seating, but with two walls of windows I imagine those seats might get warm in the summer. Some outdoor seating as well, for those who prefer that.  I got the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. The flavor combination was well done, but I was a little disappointed by the ratio of filling to bread and felt the sandwich could have been fluffed out a little more in terms of filling. The chips were neither amazing nor terrible; pretty standard fare.   I also got two different hot chocolates. One regular with almond milk, one Mexican hot chocolate with oat milk. Of the two, I'd recommend the first one. Good flavor and nice quantity of whipped cream if you ask for it in a mug. The default seems to be to-go cups, so make sure you're clear if you want to sit and stay a while when ordering. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate with regular milk and the spices smelled fantastic, but with oat milk they got overwhelmed and it was mostly an oaty flavor.   Welcoming and friendly staff. Would definitely visit again."

                "description": "I ran into Coffee Shark for a quick pick me up during my lunch break and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place is huge. I don't think anyone would ever have trouble finding a seat and it seems like a nice quiet place to work for an afternoon. I appreciated the fact that they had a lot of flavor options. I decided to get a Vanilla Rose Iced Oat Milk Latte and it was so good. The flavor was subtle and it was perfectly brewed. The only reason I knock it down to 4 stars is because it's definitely on the pricier side. I would expect to pay minimum $7 for a latte when you go in. While it may not be an everyday stop, I would still go back for sure.   COVID Precautions: Masks required for employees and customers."

There's a pretty well endowed breakfast menu, not huge full breakfasts, like pancakes, but for a coffee shop there's a lot of offerings.  Our coffees are consistent.  It's definitely not my favorite, but it's always good. Consistency is hard, which is why I don't have a favorite coffee shop.   The outdoor area is great bc we always have my kids in tow and sometimes there's another kiddo out there for them to mingle with.   The details: It's an older, white, crowd. The industrial decor is neat, but the chairs are really loud when you move them.  There's plenty of parking. Staff is friendly.   It's always relatively quiet. *the reason i noticed the loud chairs *"

There was only oNe person behind the counter for taking order and  making.  We ordered  blueberry scone, cranberry muffin, cappuccino  and house coffee. Muffin was huge, both muffin and scone wasn't  fresh at all, tasted like, when you leave them for couple of day on  top of the counter and take a bite. cappuccino  and coffee was good, service is ok, they  have ample seating.

The owner, or whoever he was, was so terrified of people I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be there. Pictures look great, I'm sure the place can be a lot of fun if it weren't for COVID-paranoia. Seriously, I went all over Austin that day and NO ONE was halfway as petrified as this guy.  My brother tried to take a sip of his coffee but was soundly rebuked for exposing his nose and mouth for 10 seconds. I understand we need to be careful, and we were, but if you go to a coffee shop you should at least be permitted to make sure the thing is edible before you leave!! BTW, we wore a mask and were very careful the entire time being there.  Won't be back. There are many other decent coffee stops in Austin."

Good food, excellent desserts, and consistent coffee brewing skills exist here.  4 stars because while everything is good overall, the nitro cold brew coffee on the other-hand well to honest...sucks! Its just weak cold brewed coffee, it doesn't pack a punch of caffeine like other cafes that offer it on their menu. If you're gonna do something, do it right or do it better!  But great little place.

I love coffee but I'd honestly would get the chai next time - it was absolutely delightful. We also sampled our fair share of pastries including a blueberry muffin, pumpkin bread, and croissant. The muffin and bread were really moist and delicious, but the croissant was very bready and not a flaky, buttery croissant I was looking forward to. I think they get their pastries from a local bakery so that was cool and I would definitely try out their other pastries. Will definitely be back!"

They have a patio w/seating and cornhole outside and inside seating ranging from tables, to hi-tops, to bar top, to couches.  They have local beer offerings as well as wine in draught and the par for the course coffee choices as well as some food and pastry options.  They had a surprisingly reasonably priced pastrami sandwich which came accompanied w/chips and a pickle for $8, and though tasty enough, there was way more spicy brown mustard than meat on the sammie, making it a bit rough to get through initially. After removing most of the invasive spread from the second half of the sammie, it was much more palatable.  The doppio I got was actually a revelation! It was perfectly strong w/just the right amount of robust flavor and astringency and even came a small side of palate-cleansing mineral water. Needless to say, this was my fav part of my visit!  I did like that they also offered board games and books to entertain yourself while there.  It is counter service, but the barista waa exceptionally nice and helpful in navigating me through there menu.   If ever in the area again, I will def pop in for a doppio and a little pastry nibble."

                "description": "Overall, a good place for a large group to grab drinks. I went to happy hour here with 8 of my coworkers and the outdoor seating was really spacious and well distanced from other tables.   Highlights: Their frozen margaritas (pretty strong especially for my low alcohol tolerance lol), the free tequila sampler my group received (:, the service, and the fact that they are really flexible with splitting checks for large groups!  Needs to be improved: The food was way too greasy and there weren't any plant based options for my vegan coworker. It would be nice if they had a smaller selection of dishes that were better quality and with half the oil added."

                "description": "A great, always reliable spot! They have a ton of outdoor seating with lots of shade, and excellent deals on drinks + food. Definitely a sports bar vibe, with lots of TVs, but never gets too loud (at least when I've been there) as it's really spread out. They seem to have a nice separate outdoor space that people sometimes use for private events, which I love!  The food is good -- typical burgers, sandwiches, salad, tacos. I love that they have the option to get any time of burger/sandwich on a gluten free bun or a lettuce wrap. Their lettuce wraps are huge and keep everything together! I got the Hippie with grilled chicken and loved it -- the chicken was blackened and spicy - yum! My boyfriend got the Fat Chick (not what he ordered..whoops, but still was delicious). Fried chicken with gravy, mashed potatoes, and sautéed veggies. They have a \"Hot\" (adobo) and \"Skinny\" (grilled) version of this. Nice to see some healthy and more indulgent options.   Definitely recommend if you're looking for good food, strong drinks (and some fun cocktails), and a nice place to hang with a friend or a group!"

                "description": "Actually really good, chill spot. At first, I was thinking I was going to be walking into an Applebee's and I don't think I was that wrong but where The Park separates from Applebee's is the fact that The Park is actually has good food. Well at least their burger was amazing.   Friendly staff. Good, really good, drink happy hour. We sat outside and while a normal outside sitting decision is dangerous in Texas heat The Park actually made the sitting experience enjoyable.   If you are confused on what to get, as I was, may I suggest The Rebel burger. A good sized, well done, burger with fried pickle chips on it. My thinking is this. I'm going to get pickles anyways, I might as well get them fried as well."

The service was very friendly and she gave a great suggestion on the mushroom burger.  The fries were perfectly crispy and not to large of a serving that I was overly stuffed.  I love that their burgers don't come with mustard and mayo and will only add them if you request it.   The hubby had the park burger with onion rings, which he enjoyed buy nothing extravagant.      I did like that they were playing old music videos."

She apparently felt the need to make us aware that their back patio was 21 and up only. She told us she'd let it go this time though. The problem we have is that we had no idea. It was her employee who sat us there. It was unnecessary for her to tell us, unless she was planning on moving us of course (which she didn't). It most certainly was unprofessional on her part. It sounds like they need a team meeting to address their issues with seating. We did nothing wrong but felt embarrassed and in the wrong when we had NOTHING to do with where they seated us. Also, we have sat on that same patio with kids many times prior to without consent from a manager...My husband tried to speak with her about the situation but instead of handling it professionally, she automatically banned him from the restaurant."

Personally, the one on south Lamar tends to be better, but they both have the same menu!   Their chips and queso is to do for. Reliable and we always get this.   My hubby always always always gets the angry chicken penne. It's amazing. Probably horrible for you but it's what dreams are made of. This week I got the Works flatbread which was delicious! I honestly think I have tried everything on the menu. I loveee the garlic fries and the Mac and cheese too.   On sundays they have an all you can eat brunch buffet. Covid and just buffets in general make my weary of eating communal foods but they were handling it smartly. Don't skip out on their happy hour too!"

The waitress had half her butt sticking out of her shorts, and an unexplainable and unjustified air of superiority (which always sucks).  She asked us what we would like to drink as we were walking up to our table and what we needed to eat, soon after!  Being seniors we don't intuit such answers and actually have to look at the menu.  The food was equally unimpressive although the drinks were ok because beer is hard to mess us)!"

It's a Monday so I figured in and out rather quickly but boy was I wrong. We placed a simple order and my husband's food arrived within 5mins while my chicken tenders/fries took forever. Not sure what happened in the kitchen but our server, Jennifer, was sweet and super apologetic - took the item off our bill. My order arrived after my husband finished his plate - took my food to go.  Kitchen/cook staff needs to be more alert on orders - especially on a slow day. Otherwise, the frozen mojito was amazing."

I've avoided this place in the past because I've never had a great experience with their food. Once again, food was cold. The chicken fried chicken was tough. The mash potatoes were cold and a little hard to the touch. The gravy was cold and not very very well drenched on the mashed potatoes. Slightly disappointed, but like I said we really enjoyed the company of the waitress. And the bloody Mary!"

They have a wide array of drink options that should keep any group satisfied.  There's lots of sizable tables on their patio. Enough so that even though they allow smoking outside I've never had to sit close enough to a smoking table to be bothered by it.  The bartenders are all really friendly and happy to make suggestions. If you're there on a less busy night the indoor seating has a nice intimate atmosphere, but can get crowded fast on the weekends if the weather isn't great outside.   The Korean food was super unexpected the first time I visited, and while I haven't made it part of my experience most times I've come here, I can't remember myself or any friends having a bad experience with the food.  Overall I'd highly recommend giving them a try if you're looking for a casual bar in the area!"

It's kind of small inside, but the patio is pretty spacious and dog friendly. And the best part is they play full vinyl albums over the outdoor speakers. They've got great taste, and I would definitely be a regular if I lived closer."

                "description": "I liked the vibe of the old spot, Royal Jelly, so it was a relief to find Long Play is very much a worthy successor.  Stopped by for a margarita and a bowl of meat chili while running from point A to B on Sat eve.  The chili is indeed delicious - no beans, with a good amount of heat inherent - I'd place it as one of the best bowls I've had in all of Austin.  Good liquor selection for cocktails, and a goodly amount of picnic tables out front to soak up the sun.  They were spinning Herbie Hancock and Specials records, which hits some sweet spots for me.  Added bonus that I easily nabbed one of their adjoining parking spots.  Hoping this one sticks around - it definitely has the makings for a great neighborhood bar!"

We sat at the front for the best view. Quiet electric barge, no spray. Could not hear commentary; boat may need Bluetooth speakers at the front. Good views of downtown buildings! We saw two groups of egrets settling in for the night. We saw some bats flying out of the Congress Ave bridge! Not many bats because this was in November.  We missed a few bats because the boat returned to the dock to drop off some people who needed to use the bathroom :( The tour guide could have stated that the boat had no bathrooms. It is obvious to the guide but not to the first-time visitor. Tip: go to the bathroom before you board the boat."

                "description": "I called Capital Cruises late afternoon a few days ago to inquire about the dinner cruises and spoke with Britney. She was very courteous and took the time to share more about the boats and pricing options, but proceeded to share with me that they weren't able to book me officially at the time because it was after hours. She shared that they only had one boat left for the date I requested but they would put a soft hold on it for me and I could call back to officially book with a credit card. No problem -- I completely understood that and was also very happy with her customer service orientation.  Today I reached out to follow up, and spoke with Tony. I shared my name and that I called a few days ago about booking a boat, and he asked what date I was looking for. I shared the same date and he said they were booked until a week out from that date. I let him know that I had spoken to Britney about this earlier in the week and she placed a soft hold for me. He was clearly annoyed with this and shared that that isn't their policy but yes, they actually did have a boat available. He then immediately asked for my card info -- didn't bother to share more, didn't bother to see if I had questions, etc. I asked him directly if this would be a problem booking (since I noticed from his tone how annoyed he was). He said no and that I could call back when I was ready to book. After that experience I do not plan on booking this cruise anymore. I was prepared to spent over $500 for this package with the boat and the meal options I was considering and will gladly spend that money elsewhere. Disappointing customer service."

We went in early November, so we weren't sure how many bats would be left, and there were TONS! It's truly an experience I'll never forget. Thank you to the employees and captain!"

The tour included city views with running commentary followed by the bats flying out from under the bridge for a very long time. Our questions were addressed and we saw many unusual birds and other sights. It was a real highlight for me. My only concern was that my GPS took me to the bus entrance and I was almost late trying to find my way to the parking garage and then through the hotel to the boat dock. The rest of my family got there in plenty of time but they were more familiar with the area. I got a great video of the bats so it was totally worth the hassle."

We've always had 6 folks, so it's a super economical outing and it's BYOB and snacks. They have a little thingie for you to plug your phone in for some tunes, too.  Very little interaction with staff beyond checking in, getting the quick lay of the land, errr, lake, and when they help you dock at the end, so super COVID safe, in that respect."

I was told they had plenty but they were FCFS. We arrived the only 4 seater they have was broken. I also asked about the donut boats, \"they go out every hour and you have to reserve them in person\". That was incorrect again. I don't recommend using this company. It was a waste of time."

Hardly anyone was on the lake. The staff is super friendly. They have a tent outside and a touch less payment system. Prices are reasonable and their equipment is good too. They have some outside cubbies for your stuff should you choose to leave anything at the dock. The pics are from the bat cruise in October 2019. Highly recommend!"

On the day of the event, they were there for us for whatever we needed which really helped calm our nerves.  We were fortunate to have great weather and our guests were thrilled with the evening.

                "description": "The Park is so god awful, I tried erasing this from my brain... unfortunately, I was reminded the other day when driving through the Domain. The Park demands to be seen, it's located on a busy street where it's not hard to miss.   I came in to meet a few friends for The Park's Sunday Funday, where they boast about a ~$20 Brunch Buffet and 5 different flavors of Mimosas. Everything tasted dry and bland in the ingredients. But, what more do you expect for such a low cost? The typical breakfast is served (eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles/pancakes) with handful of lunch entrees (fried rice) and a variety of desserts (pudding, cookies).   Would not return."

Not exactly anything to rave about but a really good variety for what you pay for and the atmosphere more than makes up for it w versatile seating options and plenty of tvs to watch sports on. Mimosa flavors are great and the buffet had plenty of options to appease everyone at the table, even the picky ones. It is obviously a go to for many as the line was wrapped around and down the sidewalk by 11am when they opened. It's usually my go to in the domain when I want to have a quick catch-up w someone."

Well, this go around, everything I had was really good.   We did the brunch buffet, which was about $16... a win. The food was really good. The French toast, the eggs with veggies, potatoes, fried chicken, and the macaroni hash *mouth waters* was all cooked with love and seasoned well. The mimosas during brunch was $2.  I had a pineapple basil or something and that was very tasty.   Our waitress was very attentive and gave good recommendations."

                "description": "I thought I had heard good things about this place and I will give you my Mahi mahi tacos had good flavor. Biggest complaint would be the occasional long black hairs in my food and the filling felt a bit scrimpy (pic attached)- there just wasn't much meat, mostly cabbage in the taco, and the tortillas were just too large. I honestly chose this place because of the sign out front advertising the frozen mojitos, and that was the first thing I inquired about and they didn't have them. I got a regular mojito and it was honestly made alright but a horrible experience consuming it because instead of putting mint leaves in, they were finely chopped up so I got pieces of mint in my mouth every sip I took. Probably won't be back."

My first time in a while out and the service was on point with the continued mimosa which there are 8 types. My favorite thing about the park is eating outside and given gloves to make my plate each time you go to the buffet for brunch. The chicken enchiladas are on a point as well.

They have a great happy hour menu that I will have to stop by again to give another try! However parking garage is right across the street and it's free so that's always a plus! I had their margarita and chips and dip, nothing to rave over but nothing to \"complain\" about. I know they have more potential and quite possibly caught them on an off day. Will update this review when I revisit!"

The place is lively and has a dark, rustic feel to it. Seating inside and out!   I liked the fries the most. It was unlike any fry I've ever had. It was fluffy and addicting!   Based off of how good our burgers tasted, I'm sure any of the other choices are just as good! They were so large, we could hardly finish it. Tastes just as good for leftovers.   Don't skip the fried pickles! They're a good starter.   Mac and Cheese was good, could've been a little more cheesier, but it was creamy and it had an adequate amount for what it's worthy (lots of people get skimpy when it comes to adding a side of Mac and Cheese)   Our server was friendly and attentive. Great at memorization--he didn't have to write anything down with no mistakes. And those who dropped off other food at our table were nice as well!"

This was not that-it was like sand. I'll probably come back for the wings or a drink but I definitely won't be ordering a salad;)"

                "description": "I don't know what happened to this place.  It was a great place pre-COVID, but my last visit there was terrible.  I visited The Park on Sunday for their brunch and with the hour long line, I had high expectations.  For starters, it took +15 minutes for our waitress to come to our table to take our drink order.  I wanted coffee and the waitress warned me that their coffee is \"terrible.\"  I was amazed that she said that but I wanted coffee nevertheless.  I should have listened to her - the coffee is TERRIBLE.  Moving onto the food - the buffet was well stocked with the usual breakfast foods; eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, etc.  What annoyed me though was when the platter of churros (they are delicious) was not restocked and I asked the employee handing out plates and latex gloves when more would be coming out, and all I received was a shrug and she went back to looking at her phone.  The Park is a well liked place and I hope that I just caught them on a very bad day.  I do recommend that they do something about the coffee - I'm not a coffee expert but what they were offering was well below standards.  Due to this experience, I won't be having brunch there again any time soon."

                "description": "Came to The Park for the popular Sunday brunch, however just decided to order items from the menu and not partake in the buffet due to Covid-19.   Table for two and we got seated immediately. To start I ordered a Habanero bloody mary, followed by a pickle zing bloody mary. I should've stuck with the habanero bloody mary, it tasted so much better than the pickle zing.  For food I placed an order for Parmesan Fried Calamari and Spinach Artichoke Dip. The calamari was great, just had a few bad bits in the batch. For the spinach dip I did enjoy, but the chips were more a crunchy biscuit. As a mexican I need basic tortilla chips haha. The spinach artichoke dip alone was delicious once you get past the chips.   After consuming these two starters I wanted something more filling, so I order the Slider Trio that comes with a jalepeño slider that was my favorite of the three. Second slider had mushrooms and grilled onions. I don't care for the mushrooms so I take those off and the slider was decent. Last slider had a fried pickle on it. The crunch of the fried pickle on this one was delicious.   To wash all this food down I then order their great variety of mimosas for only $2 on Sunday's! I'd say my sunday brunch was a breeze at The Park."

Before leaving we called to see if we needed a reservation and if they allowed dogs on the patio (yes). The hostess who answered the phone was very difficult to understand and didn't understand what I was asking leading to me asking the same question a number of times.   When we got to the restaurant the same hostess didn't understand that we may have a 3rd person joining us and was again, difficult to understand. Some of this I will leave up to masks but I also saw her walking to seat a table while talking on her cell phone... come on.   We also saw waiters with masks below noses and one even served a drink with no mask at all.   Our waitress Nicole was great, very attentive and responsive. Food was pretty good but nothing very special and the drinks were good though a bit weak.   There are better spots in the domain to choose from. I was overall disappointed in the experience."

My husband's beer was never empty and our food came out promptly and they were pretty busy too.  My pizza was delicious, but definitely too much food for someone with an average appetite.  It's enough for two people to share."

The burger itself was overcooked and dry; I don't know if this is normal, if the kitchen was having a bad series, or if the customer can request medium-rare.  Something to consider for next time.  And there should be a next time too, because this is still a great deal: burger + side for under $10.  Sure, it'd be nice if cheese wasn't an upcharge, but that's really a minor quibble.  Inside, the décor is funky and vibey, much like the other restaurants and shops in this North Loop neighborhood.  What stands out most inside is the massive album art print from Stone Temple Pilots's Purple.  Thanks to this, I haven't been able to get \"Interstate Love Song\" out of my head for the past four days."

This is a great spot with an outdoor seating area in BOTH the front and the back (which I didn't know at first).  Their drinks are pre-California exodus cheap, so grab a beer or two or three. They also have grub. There's plenty of burgers to choose from, a coworker said their portobello burger is bomb. I got the burger special, which was arugula and blue cheese. My burger was slightly overcooked and a coworker's was well-done, so you'll have to be mindful of that; if you like yours med-rare or medium, I would call it out. I thought they were pretty generous with the blue cheese, but the burger itself could have been slightly larger; they're thick but relatively tiny. Buns are toasted. I think next time I'd go with one of the classic burgers since I felt the burger special was really heavy, the arugula doesn't bring enough balance for the funkiness of the blue cheese. The parmesian fries were alright, a tad too salty for me.  The guys behind the bar were nice, a bee got stuck in my bottle and they kindly replaced it.  PARKING: there's a few spots out front, but there's plenty of parking around the corner in the residential area.  Come for the drinks, stay for vibes."

The seating is a bit hodge podge cabin lodge so you might find yourself standing if it's crowded, but as is the case anywhere that's solid. All the drinking options for all the drinking types. The burgers look legit, but I didn't have one.  Bundle up and throw 'em back."

I guess they don't care about this pandemic at all.  I watched the cook scratch his head, grab his phone and text then started to assemble a burger without a care in the world or concern for cleanliness.  So if I were you I would eat before I go to this establishment."

It's located in such a chill part of Austin, so it's perfect when you feel like going out, but not going out (if you know what I mean)! They have a ton of beers on tap and handful of yummy sounding cocktails. We didn't eat here, but when we saw their blue cheese bacon burger with huge azzz onion rings on the side we were wishing we did! It was totally embarrassing, but my husband accidentally spilled his first beer on the bar and the bar tender did a great job at not acting completely annoyed at him, although he was. He even poured him another which we were not expecting at all, so that added to our great experience here! Highly recommend, but only if you're not a high-maintenance little princess because it definitely has some grunginess to it ;)"

But this most recent visit was teetering on between 2-3 stars.    I ordered the White Manhattan, which has always been awesome!  This visit it tasted like they poured me a glass of watered down Moonshine and added a twist of Orange.  I ordered a second one just to make sure it was just not a bad pour.  Nope the second one was as bad as the first. The odd thing is they bartender who made them both, was the same bartender who has made them for me on my prior visits.     We were also quite bothered by the loud group behind us slamming their cards on the table as they played some unknown card game.  They were overly loud and obnoxious.  We were not the only customers who were annoyed.  The other pet peeve I have is when large groups of people stand at the front door of an entrance to smoke cigarettes.  On this visit there was always a group of 3-7 people puffing away well within 15 feet of the front door.  People...please go smoke out back on the patio.  The upside of this visit was the music from the jukebox.  For $2 we were able to select 8 tunes.  Music selection is random, but good."

                "description": "Workhorse is the perfect little neighborhood bar. It has a fairly large and very affordable selection of drinks, an all-around-the-clock \"happy hour\", great bar food and a nice staff! They also have a jukebox (select 4 songs for a dollar) and a patio in the back.   In the food department, they've got a good selection of sides and appetizers, as well as burgers, salads and fries. Vegetarians will be pleased to find out they have several veggie options, including two types of veggie burgers and many sides. The food is cheap and tasty. I don't know about you, but for me that's getting pretty close to my definition of heaven!   If you want available seating space for the duration of your stay, I recommend visiting between Monday and Thursday. Friday and weekends are very popular nights and you might not be able to find a cozy spot to sit, although that goes for most bars.  If you pass by the North Loop strip one evening, you should definitely drop by and have a taste of Workhorse."

You had a perfect blend of affordable high-end food and now,,,, wow you offer such exiting fare as chicken sandwiches?! How is this something anyone looks forward to? Such typical bar food.  I told all my neighbors this and they were shocked. GET BACK THE OLD RESTAURANT. Guys, *that's what made you special and memorable. Your bar isn't that exciting or enticing without it.. think about your Rock Rose Street competition. We were sooo sad to see these food items go. I hate to say it, but we will NEVER be back.

From the outside it looked like a sports bar and it was. When you enter you can order food from a full menu of mostly seafood cuisine. We just skipped this and headed straight to the bar where located right in the middle of this establishment.  This place has lots of flat screens showing a wide variety of sports entertainment. The beer choices was excellent and enjoyed the one I had. Staff were nice and tended to our needs very well.  Fun atmosphere where there was an adult birthday party going on here. Another nice design is very open to the outside even if sitting inside unless way in the back. We enjoyed it and next time pick something off the menu."

                "description": "Was in the mood for a late night meal and decided to hit the Domain for Lavaca's 30th Anniversary Party to grab a bite to eat. An absolutely phenomenal decision as the food was delicious! Neither of us ordered drinks (I was a little disappointed - didn't see any special anniversary drinks available!) but the food was great.   There are several locations for Lavaca Street Bar, but we visited this one because it's closest to my house. As it is also a bar, you will need to bring along an ID because they do card to enter. This location, as with the others, features both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for a closet table because I'm on crutches so mobility and accessibility were a main focus. Be advised, you order at the front and they will bring your food to you, but you cannot order anything from your table. Instead, when you place the order they give you a numbered placard to place on the table of your choice.   In perusing through the menu, there were several items that caught my eye, but when I went up to order I noticed a special on blacked tuna tacos for the month...of course this was what I ended up selecting based on the recommendation of the cashier. WOW! My tacos arrived to the table deconstructed as they do not have any suitable corn (gluten free!) tortillas so I couldn't actually eat them as tacos. (This was not the hill I wanted to die on with my celiac disease) It was a beautiful display and they were delivered by the nicest man (super friendly, very accommodating, etc.) but I was quite disappointed that I was unable to enjoy them as tacos because of the tortilla situation.   Despite my disappointment in this....they were amazing!!! The seasoning/rub used to blacken the tuna was probably the best I've ever had and I absolutely have to try it on other meats as well. My friend ordered the chicken quesadillas and also loved it, but I think mine was better.    We came at a pretty busy time (I mean there was a party going on for goodness sake!) and our food was still on the table in the blink of an eye. I will say that this isn't the place to go if you expect to be waited on hand and foot, because this is not that type of establishment, but the service was stellar and entirely met my expectations.   The only reason I'm unable to give a 5 star is because I was unable to enjoy my meal as it was intended and I honestly can't believe they didn't have corn tortillas I could use instead. They did get creative in deconstructing it a d it was still beautiful and delicious, but I really wanted those tacos and I'm sure the tortilla would have changed the flavor as well. Hopefully next time they'll have something suitable as I definitely intend for there to be a next time!"

                "description": "FOR FLYRITE    I usually visit the location on 7th street bc my bf is obsessed with this place. We went to the location at the domain bc it's closer to his place and it was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. I already took a risk going to the domain which is like a scene from Mad Max as it is (no one wears a mask and acts like they don't know what 6ft apart means)  We decided to redeem our free sandwich promo from the app. Both our meals were incorrect and the tater tots were soggy. No, it wasn't from waiting to get home. I snuck one out of the bag at the restaurant when my bf wasn't looking and already knew dinner was going to be a no go for me. But I gave it chance. I had a long day and waited to eat until I could have a nice dinner with my lovely partner. After a hangry drive home I popped open my little box of incorrect disappointment and was instantly sad that my food was wrong. I powered through about two bites to find a long overly dyed hair in my chicken sandwich :(. I was tired and ready to end my night that I just pounded down my tots which later gave me a stomach ache.   I felt a call to rectify my order was unwarranted since it was a free sandwich and I still wouldn't eat there again anyway. My bf loves this place and it's a shame that we won't share that experience again. Oh well, onto finding the next chicken sandwich."

We got a steak poboy, ceviche, and dozen Rockefeller oysters and it was well over $70 with tip... we haven't even ordered drinks yet which is a separate process. Bartenders are usually slow and talkative to people they know and who seem to also work there. The place itself is open, has tons of tvs, and dog friendly which is why we've continued to come back. I just wish we got better service for the prices we're paying."

Everything I have tried is incredible, but my absolute favorite is the ribeye nachos and cajun fried corn. The ribeye is charred just right and the nachos are covered with a layer of black beans and cheese that just speaks to the heart. Instant fulfillment! The dirty rice is amazing as is the fried porkchops - and I am from the south so I know my fried y'all!"

                "description": "I am a huge fan of Lavaca Street Bar food! However, I write this with the caveat that both times that I have eaten here I may or may not have been in a complete sober state of mind.  What I love are the HUGE portions! After a night (or day) of drinking, this place will satisfy! On our most recent outing, I got their chicken fried chicken special. It was definitely the best value on the menu. For $16, I got a huge piece of chicken, fries, side salad, and a side of gumbo. I was very happy. My friend spent $16 on boneless wings and all that he got was a pound of boneless wings. Probably equally filling, but I'm a girl who likes variety and they get you because to order a \"side\" of fries, which they claim is 1 lb of fries, costs $8. My husband got the shrimp po-boy, which also looked amazing and is big enough to share.  The downside is definitely the prices. Because normally their food doesn't come with sides, you'll pay $16 for an entree and then another $10+ for sides. I highly recommend taking a more family style approach when eating here so you can try a variety of foods without breaking the bank because honestly, their portions are very gigantic."

Great beer selection included our current go-to Electric Jellyfish.   For food we started with the cheese curds. Incredibly crispy. I'd put theirs up against Any I've had in Wisconsin.  Finished up with a cheeseburger and fries. Both were Shockingly good. Not just good for a dive bar, flat out legit.   Can't wait to go back."

                "description": "Review for Billy's on Burnett  TLDR: a perfectly above average dive bar  For the food: I ordered Billy's \"The Shults\" burger. The wait time for the food was perfectly reasonable. The burger was well seasoned and well constructed. The only real complaint was the pickle on top was rather small and lackluster. The fries were fresh and crisp, and also well seasoned.   For the drinks: Billy's offers a more than ample beer menu with the common stock, as well as a decent selection of local breweries.   For the atmosphere: Billy's certainly fronts the image of a dive bar, and does so very well. Dimly lit, slightly crowded, and a prominent bar situated directly across the entrance all help establish the environment they want. The patio in the side is well shaded, and has much less road noise than I initially expected. The only complaint is the flies on the patio are out of control.   For the value: Given the location, I can't really blame Billy's for the prices. I feel like I payed a bit more than what I would have wanted for what I got, however, that feeling isn't uncommon in Austin in general, and especially Burnet.   Everything else: there's virtually no parking at Billy's, however there is some street parking within easy walking distance. And yet again, the flies on the patio are on another level."

The folks at Billy's did confirm that the James Beard Award winner is a regular.  The menu's, order source and pickup is at the bar.  We were clearly the only \"non-regulars\" there that day.  But, we were warmly greeted and walked through the extensive menu of burgers, sandwiches, and yes, beer options.  We will definitely be backed to try many of the other options.  The prices were very reasonable as fries come with the burgers.  The burgers were delicious, juicy and HUGE.  The burgers are served open faced.  If you like to cut your sandwich in half, the basket makes this a bit difficult.  The only downside, I gained a pound.  There is plenty of parking, the inside is much larger than we expected, and yes, it is a classic dive."

It's a dark, divy beer bar with a solid food menu including many fried appetizers, from wings to okra, and myriad burger and sandwich options, even hot dogs and an entire column of veg-head choices. I myself enjoy the indulgence of a cobra burger w/fries and a fine Texas craft beer, of which there are many. The burgers are pretty darn good and the beer is cold, so what else do you need? Entertainment? Billy's has you covered with a pool table, darts, several TVs and some arcade games in the back. Other notes: there is a patio and a small parking lot, but there is street parking nearby."

Service was really fast, even when all the trivia people arrived/ ordered all at once. If you are coming for trivia/ an event, you need to get there really early for a table. If you are coming to just hang out, double check that there is not trivia/ an event that day. A few folks walked in, saw all of the tables packed and left.   Food reviews!  -Veggie burger: solid patty, hefty amount of avocado. Not the most interesting veggie burger, but definitely solid.  -Turkey Rueben: yum, devoured quickly -Chili cheese fries: Also yum, also devoured quickly. An excellent topping to fry ratio.  -Roast beef sandwich: The person who ordered this said it was good, but wasn't going to order it again. Said it was a little too greasy/ soggy.  - Fries: They are really well seasoned but they are also really unevenly cooked. One fry is perfect, the next one seemed almost raw."

The online ordering and curbside pickup were easy and user friendly. The food, specifically my club was a big let down. I was expecting a traditional triple decker on toast style club. It was on a hoagie and even worse, there was a dark hair in the lettuce on my sandwich. Needless to say, lost my appetite after that, I tossed it. I added, in advance a 25% gratuity because that's how it works ordering curbside and during COVID19 I've been wanting to support local businesses and their staff. Won't be ordering takeout again."

                "description": "I went to Billy's for the first and last time on Sunday afternoon. They said they allowed dogs on their patio, so I figured I'd bring my well trained 3 year old pit/bulldog mix. Everything was great for 45 minutes. My dog met 3 other dogs and got some puppy rubs from about 5 patrons on the patio, and then everything changed in the blink of an eye.   An intoxicated man holding his toy dog stepped up onto the patio and immediately zoned in on mine. His dog growled at mine while my dog whined and wagged her tail because she just wanted to meet another dog. The intoxicated man sternly asked me if she was a rescue to which I replied \"no, I've had her since she was six weeks old.\" To which he replied \"Your dog is aggressive.\" I told him he was aggressive and he went all in and said \"if yOur dog touches my dog, I will slit it's throat.\" This quickly turned into a heated altercation where I knew something bad was going to happen if I stayed, so I removed myself from the situation.  I went into the bar to let them know that there was a disgruntled patron out on the patio that threatened to slit my dog's throat and the bartender asked who it was. I pointed him out through the window and she said \"Oh. He's a regular, that's so weird, he never acts like that.....\" and just shrugged.  As soon as I took one step out the door, this regular of yours, Stefan, got right back in my face, chest bumping  me, trying to rile me up by calling me insults and slurs. He went over the top and came out with the statement \"I can't wait for you to throw the first punch, so I can sue the shit out of you.\"  I'm a General Manager of another local restaurant and I understand the value of a regular customer, but sometimes if a regular oversteps their boundaries they need to be handled. Y'all are an establishment that's main priority is providing a safe environment for ALL of your customers, not just your regulars. Y'all could have prevented this whole situation from escalating and chose not to. I'm honestly more disappointed in your staff than I am with the situation with Stefan.  Out of my four years here, this was the worst Austin experience I've ever had. You guaranteed the fact that my friend and I will never return to be a potential regular for you because we shouldn't have to question our safety."

I walked up to the bar and explained it was my first time here and how did it work. The two people behind the bar, a heavily tattooed dude and a middle aged lady, were less than hospitable. I forget his exact words but something along the lines of what you see is what you get. I was waiting for my friend and just wanted to get a starter while I waited. I ordered the chili cheese fries. Lady says no, we don't have that bc of the water boil issue. I said ok. I asked if they just weren't doing appetizers. She said they were only doing fried things. (Correct me if I'm wrong but fries are fried, right?)  I said can I get queso and chips? - no.  Mmm ok can I get a blue moon- no.  I made a joke at this point bc it was awkward and like what the hell. I said I'm really striking out here. She said they had something similar and went to get it. Then this guy standing next to me orders chips and queso from the dude bartender. When the lady brought me my beer back I mentioned this and she freaked out on the dude bartender. I ruined the other guys opportunity to get queso and they made him order something else. Oops. Then I hesitantly asked if I could get frito pie. Finally I got a yes. But that yes makes no sense. I couldn't get chili cheese fries but I could get chili and cheese on Fritos? I walked away confused and put off.   My friend showed up and we decided to split a burger, we didn't even want to ask the employees what they recommended because of their foul, unhelpful, annoyed attitudes. Even my friend was like what the actual F. They were straight rude. We ordered a burger. The bun was soft and that's about it. Nothing special at all. Food was a 2, service was a 0 so as much as I hate to leave reviews like these, they get an overall 1.   Customer service, a smile, a friendly demeanor go a LONG way. Won't be giving this place a 2nd Chance."

Billy's is a chill neighborhood bar to grab a bite and have a beer or two. Their draft selection is awesome with all your favorites plus a few that will surprise you. Checkout their burger menu it's pretty extensive. I opted for a boring cheeseburger with fries. Burger was cooked perfectly and served on a bed of spiced up fries and it paired perfectly with my pint of Real Ale amber. Will definitely return but not on a Packer game day (Go Pats!)."

It's a little dive burger and beer bar with charm. What more could you ask for? It's a meet up after work on a weekday joint. It's a watch the game together joint. It's a just wanna eat fried food a chill with a beer type of place. It's not fancy. If you want fancy then don't head to Billy's. Billy's is keeping it real!"

North is our go-to birthday celebration restaurant because of their pet friendly closed patio, amazing food that will satisfy everyone at your table, and just such a pleasant staff.   The reason for the 4 is mainly because when we sit inside, although beautiful, it's so loud because the space is packed pretty tight."

                "description": "Let me say start with how amazing the staff are! We were greeted immediately. Our waiter is a Rockstar! As busy as they were, she came and checked on us frequently.   As you can see in my pictures we ordered a lot, lol. We created our pizza. The pesto was perfect. The crust on the pizza was crispy and soft. Great flavor overall.  I ordered the squid Ink. It was great spice and delicious. Only negative was the shrimp and it needed some type of veggie. The shrimp didn't hold flavor well in the dish. I think Argentina shrimp would be a better pick for this dish rather than basic shrimp.  My little one of course with her sweet tooth ordered the glazed Italian donut french toast. It actually was really good. The wild blueberry, honey lemon ricotta, hazelnut and mint combination was actually a really good combination. This dish is super sweet so make sure you have some milk or water to drink.  My other child ordered the breakfast sandwich. She loved it. She really enjoyed the hint of spice it had in it. And my oldest child ordered the Pollo fritto and asked for over easy egg. We also ordered one too so we all could try. Let me say how they cooked the perfect cut of chicken. Normally you order chicken like this and they give you a dark meat cut thigh. Not here! It was a juicy white cut. The crust was perfect! The hash brown balls were yummmmmy! We all enjoyed those.  Overall, great atmosphere, great service, great food! We definitely will be back!"

The pizza blew me away. I ordered thinking \"eh, that doesn't sound good but I'll branch out\" and WOW am I glad I did! The Pig was amazing. I was blown away by the meats! The sausage was incredible (this is coming from someone who HATES sausage on her pizza). The meats had so much flavor. Also, the service was incredible. The first time we came by, the wait after being seated was absolutely insane. We were so hungry! However, the waiter was so attentive to this and gave us a free dessert!   ....which leads me to how good the dessert is here! I am not a caramel fan, and this caramel ice cream was insanely good.   Please come to north italia. Trust me. It's our new fave!"

                "description": "An amazing experience with awesome tasty food. I may not be an Italian food expert but all I tasted was freshness, bold flavors, and great tasting meats.   The charcuterie board has figs, different types of meats such as salami and prosciutto. The char bread is awesome, nice char, mix of oils, and the crunch really helps break up the saltiness from the meats. The white looking sauce is actually cheese spread, I wasn't too much of a fan but it was ok. The best part of the board was the little Italian almonds, soft and firm yet nice crispy shell.   The beef carpaccio is yummy, tasty, and just look at the dish? You eat with your eyes and the dish appeals to your vision. Must try.   The zucchini chips are additive, nice crispy, salty, chips, a bit too oily but it's what is expected, very nice house chips.  The spaghetti and meatball dish is good but I wasn't blown away, I had a better elsewhere. The spaghetti tasted a bit too Al dente, too firm, just missing flavor. I would of spun the spaghetti in olive oil, salt, and black pepper then placed the sauce on top. Sprinkling parmesan cheese helps,"

                "description": "Wanted an Italian dinner the first night we were in Austin. Found this place about a mile from the hotel and take a chance. Pretty busy but it was Friday night around 6-7pm. Had about a 45 minute wait however we were able to sneak into a table around the bar (first come first serve).  Wife got the chicken parmigiana. Probably the best option on the menu. Crunchy chicken with great sauce and amazing noodles on the side. She also tried the bread as an app. Very crispy and fresh.  I got the Caesar salad because I wanted something lighter. Not bad but it's a salad. Also got the meatballs. Pretty delicious.  Server was very nice and we had a great time. The domain area was very fancy with plenty of shops and stores to roam around in. Worth the visit."

I've tried so many Italian restaurants including ones where they make fresh pasta and this place was truly a miss. We had a large table so we had a lot of food to be able to properly judge. Short rib hash had literally 2 pieces of chewy short ribs, deep fried potatoes soaked in oil, etc. overall hardly any taste. Truffle butter had no taste or smell of truffle. Pesto Pasta was good taste wise, but chewy. Veggie pizza was dry. We also ordered banana coffee cake for table. We asked the whip cream on side and the cake came soacked in caramel sauce. Honestly cake would have been good if it wasn't for additional overwhelming sugar added from caramel. Top of the cake was super dry and hard. Zucca chips were good. My friends also had market scramble and Avocado toast that they really liked."

Our server rarely came by, and we actually had to ask for him to remove dishes from the table.   The sicilian margarita was okay, but the ginger blossom marg was absolutely delicious. I ordered the grilled bread, which was also very good but came out borderline cold. For dinner, I had the short rib cavatelli which was quite good.   It was a bit pricey, for the portions - but it was filling. Overall, the food and drinks were enjoyable but the service could've been better."

THE BLACK AND WHITE: I came here for lunch with my team from work (since we're located in the Domain). It's nice having a great Italian restaurant closeby to get your pizza cravings in.  The waiter came by and announced the soup of the day (lentil pork soup) as well as the pizza of the day (pepperoni w/ corn). I also had the same reaction when they mentioned corn. So....I had to try it! Fortunately they are able to have half and half pizzas. I chose the Funghi and the pizza of the day.  The Funghi pizza was delicious! Rich and creamy with the white sauce. Corn on pizza on the otherhand...questionable. Love the fusion thoughts though.   THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall, the damage done for a half/half pizza was around $20 which is not bad. Delicious pizza and I definitely want to come back to try out the pasta!"

                "description": "This is a great option for Italian, especially at the Domain.  North has something for everyone, whether you're wanting a more Italian-American red sauce option or a something a bit more authentically Italian.  To add to it, they provide these options with impeccable service and in a beautiful atmosphere.  Today's review of the dining options.  First, the appetizer of crusty bread and olive oil was good.  The sprinkled cheese on top of the bread and the olive oil and balsamic vinegar already applied to the bread were surprises, but not unwelcome ones. (I'm always a fan of a separate plate of olive oil for dipping.)  The Bolognese pasta was exceptionally hearty and meaty and not the usual red meat sauce over spaghetti.  The hearty, rustic, meaty sauce combined with the flat tagliatelli pasta was both sophisticated and satisfying -- and quite possibly my new favorite for dinner as the weather in Central Texas cools. My dining companion also enjoyed her Caesar salad and the margherita pizza.  I tried the pizza and found the ingredients to be high quality.  When you combine the taste and quality of the food with the superb service, it's little wonder that North will merit a return visit soon."

We like North Italia and the variety of its menu so well, that this is where we ordered our very tiny wedding's meals from. However, the experience of dining in is a little rough - when the dining room is at full capacity (which it is mindbendingly at right now, omicron be damned?) the noise makes conversation difficult. All the surfaces in the restaurant reflect noise, which makes it more than just fun-bustling... it's ear splitting. It's got wonderful food, but don't expect this to be an intimate dinner or a place to quietly chat."

I've never been, and while I'm not a huge fan of dinning outdoors for a variety of reasons that include bugs and heat, the overall experience was lovely - until I was ruthlessly pursued by a bumble bee that appreciated my lemonade as much as I did and then by a fly that wanted it's share of my delicious meats and cheeses. Eventually, my coworkers helped rescue me as I was the only one the bee and fly targeted. While I didn't eat the Zucca chips, it was a favorite at the table. I could have ate the crispy calamari and arugula for days! For the seasonal salad, it had a great flavor, yet I felt the salmon was grilled to perfection. The texture was perfectly paired and was still juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to return to North, although I may opt for an indoor seat."

                "description": "North Italia, appropriately or coincidentally located in the northern part of the domain, a spot that's been on my mind but just never got around to it. Glad though this past weekend I had the perfect excuse to go for a friend's birthday. So I thought, italian fusion to celebrate a birthday? Okay I'm in.  Atmosphere: Top notch for the atmosphere here. I will say again the location helps it a lot with a nice patio dining outside and modern vibe on the inside. The location is a perfect spot to people watch and/or enjoy a nice drink or two with friends in a shaded area. The theme overall has a modernized upper casual dinning experience.   Food: My party enjoyed a variety of food, stand outs for sure were any appetizers that have bread included. Cheesey Garlic or Shrimp with bread, you name it, all were so good and sharable too. As for myself as an entree I was caught between the bolognese or short ribs. The server was kind enough to suggest one, so the short ribs will do! Tender with just the right amount of potatoes and veggies made for a great combination of flavors when put all together.  Service: As stated above, our server was beyond friendly. Since it was a birthday our group may of been having too much fun, but the service gladly played along and still made us feel welcome and helped us with any questions.  Overall: With the impeccable service and variety of courses North Italia has to offer, I'd easily recommend it as another spot to take a few friends out and/or to explore some great Italian options. I look forward to return to explore the other pasta-bilities they have especially again the bolognese."

                "description": "If my husband and I are downtown we usually stop in for a drink here. Brian behind the bar is always fun to talk to and Johnny is always nice. I like this place because the bathrooms are decent for a bar, they have live music, there is a ring/hook game, and they serve cider.  Upstairs the other night they were having a comedy show which we sadly had to miss due to having other plans that evening. I believe they are doing more events up there but haven't been since during reopening after covid."

                "description": "TLDR: Matt and Steve saved our Bachelor/Bachelorette party from complete ruin on Labor Day weekend. We owe them a great deal of gratitude for the UNFORGETTABLE, FIRST-CLASS EXPERIENCE in Austin!   I happened upon this bar when my friends and I were walking around downtown Austin for a combined Bachelor/Bachelorette party. From first glance, it seemed like a typical Austin bar. Later in the night, our party was moved from the roof top bar we booked at the Marriot Hotel to the crowded hotel lobby due to a severe thunder storm. Needless to say, our large party of 30+ was broken up between random groups of party goers, diminishing the original experience.   It was recon mode time! I called every available open bar in Austin to see if they were able to help our rowdy group. Denial after denial, only ONE bar was able to step up to the challenge: San Jac Saloon!! Matt was updating me prior to our arrival. He was friendly, respectful, and accommodating. When I first arrived at the bar, I was so excited to see the large space with a full bar and lounge area. I couldn't have asked for more! The party goers AND bride and groom were VERY impressed with everything San Jac Saloon provided in ways of atmosphere, drink variety, and ability to have a safe, fun celebration.  Steve was our outstanding bartender; he livened up the night with his humor and antics! It was such a wonderful experience that words cannot fully describe the sincere gratitude we owe to Matt and Steve!!   If you want to support an authentic, passionate, and all around AMAZING bar, please support San Jac Saloon. I'd like to think we got a nice, hearty slice of southern hospitality as guests and I would 100% go back again for more.   My sincerest Thank Yous to Matt and Steve! You two are superheroes."

San Jac Saloon was definitely our fav. The beers op tap were great too. This place was super crowded on a Thursday so I can just imagine how packed it can get on a weekend. There is a speakeasy type quiter spot on one of the higher floors if you dont want live music. Either ways a great spot to have fun in Austin. Must visit."

I've been sitting on these experiences for the last couple of months ago  and decided to write a review to prevent any other person from going though a experience like mine . Back in March I was uncomfortably sexualized by the bouncer Colton . When I explained to him that I felt uneasy with his remarks he decided to smack my ass in a \"playful\" way and laugh. I walked in grabbed my friends and left . Until this day it's really disturbing to me to think a individual like himself can still be employed in a high risk environment. Please stay safe"

After unexpected lightning forced us to leave our original outdoor venue, Matt and his team were extremely helpful and provided us at the last minute with a private upstairs part of the bar to host our event. Even with very short notice, Steve the bartender gave us great service and ensured everyone was having a blast. Great drinks and great people in a fun space, I'd absolutely recommend stopping by!"

However, they have this angry Irish bartender that was picking fights with several customers. Additionally, he sat at the end of the bar ignoring customers while he visited with friends. He complained when the customers gave him smaller tips and was rude the entire evening. You couldn't say anything without him yelling at or arguing with you. Not sure if this is the vibe the place is going for, but I will not be returning. I also spoke with a few of my local friends and family about my experience and they will be avoiding the place as well."

We met this amazing man with a beard (We think Brian?) he was so welcoming! He had us take a group photo AND he let us bring our puppy inside. I bought a couple shirts and we weren't planning on returning for the night since we had a reservation at FBBC at 6:00 PM. However unfortunately our two transgender friends had a bad time... It's a long story and we left a review on their page hopefully to fix the issue but we were so upset from the bad experience. So we told ourselves hey! Let's go back to San Jac they made us all feel so welcome and Jared and the other owner know how to run a bar. ID checks TOOK 2 SECONDS FOR EVERYONE We went back inside and the process was easy and we went back inside and walked upstairs. We spent 70 dollars on an Uber just to come back!! Brian was gone which made us sad because we wanted to tell him how absolutely incredible he is. But we met this very nice Irish man upstairs and he was incredible! He fist bumped one of us and we handed him a tip and man he was such a gem. The music in both areas was rockin and we felt so welcomed and at home at this bar. You see... we had some charity shirts for Jensen and Jared because I run an organization called Castiel's Angels and they needed updated t-shirts with their new television roles and charity organizations. We were told by Brian to bring them to brewery but after what happened we were like ... no let's bring it to San Jac. They took the shirts and we are confident Jared will get them without an issue. We will be back when we come back to Texas. We are originally from Nevada, Oklahoma, and California and this road trip was supposed to be special. San Jac made up for our trip and we were treated with such respect! Best bar ever!!!"

The flavor tasted like it has been brined for a while--perfectly salty and tender.  The brown butter cake was not very good and the fries were just alright.

                "description": "I was seriously disappointed by my experience here at salt and time which had been highly recommended to me by a friend. They missed pretty much every mark in terms of a good dinner experience. Let me elaborate.  We got there an hour before closing around 8pm, and were going to try to get in and out quick and didn't want to make them stay too late after closing. Well, we didn't have a choice because right off the bat we had to wait for menus for probably five minutes, waited another 10 for the waiter to come take our order, and when we finally placed our order probably 20 minutes had gone by so we put our whole order in at once.  We ordered the little gem Caesar-type salad, a ribeye (MR) and Teres Major (mr).  We waited (literally) 45 minutes for our salad!!! Waiter kept telling us it was coming and at the 40-min mark he asked \"you guys still haven't gotten your salad?\" Seriously!!!? It's your job to bring it to us and we've asked you about it three times now!  Keep in mind the restaurant was nearly empty by now. When we finally got it there was minimal apology and he seemed very nonchalant like it wasn't a big deal and turns out it wasn't even little gems. I grow little gems and serve them at the restaurant where I work and was super excited for them but this was just a regular iceberg wedge. After 1.5hrs of waiting at this point, steaks came out. Sauces were all wrong and not what we ordered and my steak was over cooked! Clearly medium and not medium rare since my partners was cooked correctly, there was an obvious difference. But at this point, being checked on by our waiter was a ten minute affair so we just shut up and ate it because it was getting late. There were no apologies, no comps, and the waiter kept trying to push us on dessert when we clearly were ready to leave. Dropped the check and proceeded to say \"there's no rush!\" ... yeah no sh*t I can tell that's definitely a motto here. And on top of that there was automatic 20% gratuity. I usually don't mind that, because most restaurant that do auto-grat have good service where I would've tipped 20% anyways. but it should not be a motivator for the servers to not give a crap about their tables like it is here.   The steaks tasted good but for the price, the horrible service and the inability to get orders right, this place was a total wash. You can get better steaks elsewhere for a cheaper price, where you actually enjoy your dining experience. Maybe in the future if they got new staff or management this place could be a really nice restaurant but for now, I can't recommend it."

                "description": "Pretty miserable experience. There were at least 5 open tables when we sat down so they were not busy. It took 10 minutes for the waitress to give us a menu and immediately ask for our drink orders. 20 minutes later we get them. We've been here for 30 minutes and haven't gotten to place our order yet.   I order the $52 filet as did my friend. I ordered mine medium rare, he ordered his medium. His looked well done but he likes his meat well done so he didn't care. Mine however was completely raw on the inside. Not \"cooked rare\" raw. This thing was seared for maybe 10 seconds. It was also very tough. The waitress just dropped off our food and we were waiting for steak knives for 10 minutes until I walked to the hostess and asked for them.   I sent the steak back and it took at least 25 minutes to get it back. At this point so did not want to pay $52 for a reheated steak so I asked another waitress to grab me a burger instead so I could get the hell out of here. They come back with my steak, which was missing a piece, that had clearly been thrown into an oven or microwave to increase the internal temperature.   If you're coming here expecting an artisan or holistic steakhouse experience, go somewhere else. If you're looking for some $15 cocktails to drink in a gentrified strip mall butcher shop, this is the place for you!   My experience was so bad that I considered contacting my credit card for a refund. It was that bad."

                "description": "Came here on a burger recommendation. It was a nice little place for brunch. I don't if I was just bad at finding it, but apparently they only have the brunch and dinner menu on the weekend. The lunch menu is only offered on weekdays so if you're wanting to come here for the lunch menu on the weekend, you are out of luck.   But their brunch menu still does offer a burger, the Butcher's Breakfast burger to be exact. It's pretty much the normal Butcher burger but with eggs and bacon added on, and i think cheaper too. I got it medium and it was a nice, hearty burger. It was a juicy, steak-y patty and the brioche bun was quite soft. I probably should've just taken the bacon and eggs out and eaten it separately though. It got a little to big for me.   Beef fat fries are a must try though. Nice soft potato filling, with a slight crisp. I might be wrong, but I tasted a hint of cinnamon and it had a quiet deep fried donut flavor that I am all too familiar with. Very addicting.   Came here on a 1PM Saturday and there was no wait, but I do here it does get crazy busy during dinner times so make sure you have a reservation. Our server was really sweet. The place overall had a calm and chill atmosphere and felt very clean."

                "description": "Best burger in town without a doubt. My friend was singing it's praises for a while and so a group of us showed up all ordering it. Go figure. But it lives up to the hype for sure. It's basically made from trimmings from the butcher shop, so it's ground pretty fresh, seasoned well and honestly tastes almost steak like from the cuts, so highly recommend medium rare or medium on the burger. It's also massive, so no chance you'll leave hungry. Some fresh veg and a nicely toasted bun round off the sandwich. I would also recommend adding some bacon at least to your burger, as it's crisp contrast and who doesn't like bacon.  As if that's not enough, the sides there are also A+. The beef fat fries have a lot of flavor, but also thick enough that you can appreciate the pillowy potato inside. The what I assume house made ketchup adds some needed acidity to all the food but jives well with everything. The shishito pepper app is also really good if you can tolerate a little bit of burn.  Service is a bit on the slow side at the restaurant, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can but also being patient and just enjoy the decor and conversations with people. The appetizers came out same time as the food too, so waiting an hour for food at 1pm on a Monday afternoon sounds a bit long, but good thing we had good company at least."

It was very difficult to hear what she was trying to tell us. Even the younger guest with perfect hearing said they couldn't understand her. Then the food came. It was like the Goldilocks story. Some food was cold, some was overdone, and some was just right. Austin is a big place with many other places to try before we'll attempt to return here."

They charge me the fries and they add a service fee of around 20% on a 2 person 2 meals .  I feel sorry for the waitress I can see she was hesitant about bringing stuff to the table probably cause she knows they charge for everything.... Btw the lobby is close and we had to eat outside with tons flies joining us"

                "description": "Brunch today allowed me to check another big name off my list. I heard their Butcher's Burger is the best in Austin, so with nothing else calling to me off the menu, I had to try it. It was ok, I think? It was so tall and hard to eat that it was hard to really process and appreciate the flavor. They cooked it right, but the runny egg made the bun slide everywhere and mayo seemed like overkill. The Beef Fat Fries were pretty good, but not so good that I felt compelled to eat the whole serving. My favorite thing was the Charcuterie Plate that we split before the meal, especially the summer sausage, mortadella, and unidentifiable pink pickles. My friends loved their Steak and Eggs. I tried a bite of a friend's French Toast and would have gladly eaten more! While we were waiting for our food, browsing the butcher shop was interesting, and I liked seeing what products exist even if I wasn't in the market to buy anything. Service was attentive. I'm already planning on coming back again sometime because I know other carnivorous friends will love it. But now it's time for an afternoon nap!"

The reviews don't lie. GET THE BURGER. Oh and the fries were bomb too.   My wife got the BBLT (beef bacon), and I have to say, it was the best BLT I've ever had. On top of favor, the portion was ginormous. Though, it didn't hold up as well as a leftover.   All in all, highly highly recommend, especially once they open dine in. The patio seating is nice but way too hot during the summer"

First and foremost the Beef Tartare is probably one of the best beef tartares I have ever eaten in my life - the mix of flavor was just incredible, and the steak was perfectly diced! I could eat this everyday. Absolutely superb.  We also got the Cesar salad to start which was another hit. For the main we shared the Wagyu NY Strip, side of fries and broccolini, and the sweet corn agnolotti. My ONLY complaint was that there wasn't a larger portion of the agnolotti, delicious stuffed pillows of creamy sweet corn. Service was friendly and hospitable, will definitely be back!"

Covid brought the addition of the upscale butcher shop, complete with many house-made items, terrines and fine meats...very impressive selections.   During Covid they also expanded into a new patio for dining, complete with large overhead fans, which made a very pleasant setting on a warm evening.   My daughter and I enjoyed a really great Charcuterie Board, that included 4 wonderful house-made meats, accoutrements and sauces. We shared it and both loved it.  We also shared their absolutely delicious Butcher Burger, made from steak trimmings. It was cooked perfectly and served on a brioche bun with all the trimmings, and the best French fries we've had in a long time.    We will definitely return to this east side neighborhood gem!!"

NFL Sundays are really busy, so plan accordingly if you want to come then. It's more or less a KC Chiefs bar, but everyone is welcome. I prefer the upstairs part of the bar, but there's a huge downstairs and even some outside seating available.   The drink selection is alright, but I wish there were more draft beers for patrons. I do like the Zilker Parks and Recreation whenever I come in because it has that crisp taste of a good Pilsner. I even found it at Spec's after I tried it here. I also like the Electric Jellyfish IPA, which has a high alcohol content and it is a good drink if you want a little more \"party\" taste. I just wish they had more good beer on tap... oh well.  The food here is alright. I had some fried pickles the first time I came in, which weren't the best but good for a snack. They also have pizza, which I never had but may go for it next time. I never really have food when I come here, but maybe I should indulge in some dinner in the future.   I love coming here to watch ballgames and just to hang out in general. Trivia on Wednesdays from 7-9 if you ever want to bring some friends to play, I love it!"

The upstairs was a little busy with groups, but after sitting at a table for a few mins, we were eventually able to grab a spot at the bar. There were 1-2 bartenders for the evening and they did the greatest job managing the busy bar. The red-headed guy bartender made me the most delicious drink with a pretty flower in it! It was pink and sweet and so tasty!  We also shared the hugest mozzarella sticks I've ever seen and they were DELICIOUS!! We also also got the potato skins (which are literally two giant twice-baked potatoes) and th pretzels with queso!"

I absolutely cannot handle how much cheese comes on this burger sometimes but if it means losing the (hamburger) buns then so be it!  I need it to get in my belly as fast as possible!!!!!  Been coming to The Tavern since I was a student at UT in 2001.  This place is THE BEST PLACE to come watch futbol (soccer) games, UT games, NBA games, and all other games under the earth's sun.  There is plenty of room for you and your friends and family to watch the games, eat, and drink here.  One of the best places to be an avid sports goer as the service, food, and overall ambience is super welcoming.   Recently I brought my family in from San Antonio to try some tasty burgers and have a couple of pints during a Sunday afternoon.  It was super tame downstairs but I saw dozens of people head upstairs for game watching. My family really loved all the options on the menu and first thing out of their mouth was \"It is super laid back here\" and they enjoyed it.  Everywhere else we went we drove right past people standing outside waiting to get seated even after brunch hours!   Parking is located across the street and isn't too bad during lunch times.  If there is a serious or big game going on you might have some trouble finding a good spot but there are nearby garages around the corner and/or paid parking.   Love the new clear dividers between booths and seating now as it made me feel really comfortable now that masks are not mandatory."

This is a chiefs backer bar so if you are a fan it's a great vibe to watch the game and they have the sound on. The bartender let us order the sampler app as they have a limited menu on Sunday for the games! Got some beer and then right before the half we ordered burgers and they didn't come out at all. We reminded our bartender and she said the kitchen lost the ticket, she then went missing and someone tried to give us a burger we didn't order almost 40 minutes later. The kitchen closes at 10 and we still didn't have our food so we asked for our check and left because we were starving after waiting almost a hour and 20 mins for our burger."

I was over on this side of town thrift shopping, then decided to blow my careful thrift shopping budget by overpaying for yet another dinner out. I was expecting an older bar to have an older clientele, but it was surprisingly full of college kids. I guess we are closer to UT than I remembered. I ordered the Loaded Potato Skins. Potato Skins?

The tavern burger is good but the Tex max burger is better. The chicken wings are just okay. We got the Buffalo and the Thai chai. The macaroni and cheese does not need to add chicken because the chicken is pretty dry and overwhelms the dish. The pretzels are only okay. The potato is great. The fried mozzarella is really good."

It gets good ratings as a sports bar, and there were lots of tvs.  But the bar in uncomfortable, the space is drafty and cold, and the food is frankly bad american. The chicken sandwich recommended by the barkeep as her \"second favorite\" was pretty good fried chicken, ruined by drenching in Frank's hot sauce and raw onions. The dill pickle was, well....not. the tater tots were just as advertised tho, and saved me from starving. Drinks overpriced for the light pour."

Used to come here often because i lived down the street and i always felt like an inconvenience. still went because i liked the happy hour deals and the food was good.   tonight (easter) i placed a to-go order via yelp on grubhub. i'll admit that on a holiday it's probably wise to call ahead and make sure a place is open. but when yelp was giving me the option to place a pickup order, i went ahead and put one in-- i used to work in the restaurant industry and i know the business has the ability to cancel the order automatically if they have settings on to reflect that they are closed on certain days or hours.   my boyfriend went inside to pick up the order and unsurprisingly was given cold and inattentive service as always. best part is that he was told \"it's easter hours, we don't have an order for you.\" no special hours posted anywhere on the front or side door of the business, no half-assed apology, and there were still plenty of other folks inside being serviced.   i understand that i'll need to contact grubhub to get refunded for my order, but the lack of service is honestly so disappointing. i want to love and support a local legend in a city that i was born and raised in, but the tavern makes that really difficult."

                "description": "I've only been coming here the last 4 Sundays, but the last two visits were polar opposites, and I'm not coming back after today. First, the good: last week was fantastic. Great bartender. Attentive. No problem getting my game on. I ended up buying more cocktails just because the dude was doing a good job, and I felt he deserved more dollars. Today was the opposite. I arrived 20 minutes early to get a seat and so as not to be a nuisance when asking for a specific game when it was peak busy. When I asked if I could get a specific game on, they told me it would be on one place where it ultimately wasn't. I sat for a good long while there until it was clear it was the wrong game, and I asked again, and they reseated me saying it was gonna be over here. Still not. I ask once more when my food comes. The tvs in front of me are a soccer game, a game which is on 4 other screens, and a default team logo vs team logo graphic showing who will be playing on that channel in 3 hours. I should note that those nothing graphic screens were taking up at least 4 tvs. Any one of which could play the game I was looking for or others instead of being wasted space. The server gets snippy with me at this point and says \"I'll check!\" He doesn't check. I watch him and he goes over to stand while just messing around on his phone. I have never ate a sandwich with so much anger. I asked for the check and left. I don't want for a lot. The service could have been slow. The food could have been bad. The drinks could have been weak. I probably wouldn't have cared because the plan was to be there for 3 hours. The goal was simply to watch a game and for 8 of 11 TVs upstairs to be either duplicate games or showing no live game at all felt kind of insulting when you've made me ask 3 times."

I walk in and there's a table with some merchandise on it and this little man, asked if we were there for the event? I said \"we didn't know there was an event\" and then he said it was $25 per person... well we didn't know, we just came for a drink and some parents night out. So I said sorry and we excused ourselves and then this same lady at the front was smoking outside so I said \"Sorry, we didn't know it was an event\" and she snarkily says \"Yeah! it's dwarf wrestling!\" Like I should be ashamed of not knowing this. I feel stupid, my bad.... But maybe next time have a sign on the door! We read the entire door and no sign about this, a cover of $10-15 we would pay but we didn't want to do $25 per person, since we had not  arrived for the event. I think if you have an event, try being a bit nicer. Some people are not regulars and just want to come over and you could sell it a bit, instead of making us feel bad for not know about your poorly advertised event.  I still like this bar and I like that people can smoke in doors (although I'm not a smoker) we have enough bars we can go too and this one is for smokers, so I don't have an issue and I know what I'll smell like when I leave."

If that's not a problem for you, then you're in for a good time.   We came in on a Tuesday night and easily found a pool table to ourselves. We opened a tab and had no trouble getting drinks without having to leave our games. The mixed drinks are nothing to write home about, but we had an excellent time drinking and playing pool. We also easily played some table shuffle board. They have computer slots/keno games to gamble with in a shady corner is that's something you're into.   The place was acceptably clean and the staff were all very friendly. Just make sure you have a VALID drivers license regardless of your age! This was place was a good time and I'll definitely be back again in the future."

When I got home everything smelled like cigarettes. This is completely illegal and just downright nasty. Everybody knows secondhand cigarette smoke is really bad for you so open up a flipping window if you're gonna let people smoke. If you're too lazy to go outdoors to smoke then this place should be regulated by the health department better, this isn't your house, and no one saying you can't do something but it's just nasty and it's really bad for your health right now my throat is on fire because I've been breathing secondhand smoke I don't wanna sound like a whiner or entitled millennial but it secondhand smoke dude and it's nasty."

Staff has always been good to me over the years, and have been like family, met many current friends because of Shooters. Never a cover, and probably the best drink prices of any bar.  This place has great potential, but they need to make the best of some of its best assets, especially the use that beautiful patio more for events, music, etc. You should have a solo acoustic artist out there in spring/summer/fall and promote some games on the patio, it just seems as it's used as wasted space currently, and that's a shame."

Bartender was patient with us as we pondered our last cocktail of the day. Notice I said day not evening. We settled on shots (why not??!!). We all received generous pours at a reasonable price.   Shooters is a great sports bar with multiple TVS (they do have the NFL ticket). There are plenty of pool tables and games to keep you occupied. I would definitely come here to watch games but the cigarette smoke stench is too much for me, and I'm a cigar smoker. We visited for about 10 minutes and my clothes stunk of smoke. I wish they would go smokeless like their other venue on 620 or at least add some additional smoke eaters. If you are a smoker it is a 5 star joint... for others 3 makes it AOK and a fair rating."

I don't know if they still do free pool on Monday nights. That's a good chance to work on your game and save a few bucks. But watch out for scumbags. The meth-heads tend to pour in on this night.

Last time I saw her was a few weeks ago when I went after work to enjoy myself for a few drinks and even tho I go alone I do have friends there and she was so occupied playing and asking around if her machine was paying her a lady was complaining about how she hadn't give her her change back. It took her a long time to pay that lady back. It's not the first time I've seen her playing specially when it's slow but busy days won't stop her. Chris and her make a fabulous team as far as proving the worst service!!   3. Misty and the rest of the girls are the best workers there.   Too bad they lost me as a customer and will never spend one cent on that place ever again. Seeing employees playing as they work while others risk their hard worked money was the end of that. I already had enough with Chris being rude when you bother him because it seems that way. Good luck Shooters! This place has gone down hill since the past 6 months or so!!"

                "description": "Tipster Tours is a must do if you are visiting Austin for the first time (they also offer a tour in San Antonio's downtown if you also visit during your trip since it is only 90 minutes away from Austin). There are 5 tours available to choose from (some require a minimum of a group of 6 though) and are free! This walking tour allows for you to give any tip that you want after it is done. You are under no obligation to tip anything, but it would be nice for the tour guide to get something from you.   During our visit, we only went to the downtown tour, where you meet outside of the state capitol. My husband wanted to check out another tour but during our visit, it was raining and I just didn't want to walk in light rain and mud (yeah I'm a sore sport). For most tours, you just show up at the location. There is no need to RSVP (you can see the dates and time available on the company's website).  For our tour (about 90 minutes), we had Laura as our tour guide. Because this tour is all outside, we brought our little girl dog (she told us this was her first time having a dog on her tour). For this tour, it leaves the capitol, heads to the small park across the street, then to the governor's mansion (where you will most likely see either the governor's golden retriever, Pancake or their newly adopted little puppy golden retriever), various murals, other historical places and ends at the Driskill Hotel.   We learned so many things on this tour, the 3 of us enjoyed it (I am sure my little girl was happy to mark her territory as we walked along) and would highly recommend this tour. The walking is pretty easy and so most should be able to be fine."

                "description": "Our guide, Laura met the groups on time and was easy to locate. No reservations or upfront payment is required. In fact, the tours are billed as free! However, being \"Tip\"-ster, they are appreciative of tips and in the FAQ suggest $15-$25 per person per tour. Over a 2 day period, we took 3 tours...Music, Downtown and Eastside Arts. Each tour was 1 1/2 hours. Laura was very knowledgeable and was easily heard and understood. Questions were welcomed and answered. At the end of each tour, we were given information on what we could do next. Check the website before you go, as the time had changed from the week before when I planned. The time change was bolded, so easily found. Highly recommend these tours. Since we were on a \"stay\"-cation, we may do the others they offer soon!"

Newly unveiled in October, this company allows participants to \"pay\" for their tour once its completed by tipping their tour guide. This is a fantastic idea because it practically ensures you'll get a fun and informative tour.   Joey, our guide, was very friendly and knew his Austin history. He delivered his facts and info with wit and humor which kept everyone attentive and entertained. I highly recommend him if it's possible to request a guide. Bonus: Joey looks like \"Lip\" from Shameless.  Have fun!"

Had a friend in town to visit a few weeks ago and we did the Downtown tour, then returned yesterday with my sister for the East Side Art tour. I have to be honest and say that I didn't anticipate enjoying the art tour (art isn't usually my thing), but it was super fun and informative. Both tours were great and completely worth the time and money. Love the idea that you pay what you can afford in order to bring tours to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to participate.

                "description": "Admittedly I came here on New Years Eve for some late night munchies before the countdown, not knowing this joint was part of the Hilton Hotel. That explains why the prices were slightly high when tacos are ubiquitous in Texas.   The fish taco was actually really good. I think they might have been a close tie for tacos I've had on my Texas trip. However the old school tacos were kind of boring and a little difficult to eat because they were getting soggy.  Our drinks were really good...but really sugary. It would be hard for a drink to taste bad with that much sugar. I would commend a bartender that can make a drink taste good/sophisticated without resorting to all that syrup. I felt like I was drinking candy syrup. This missed the mark for me in creativity or sophistication.  Would I recommend this place again? I'm unsure. If I stumbled upon here, I would definitely eat here again but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to eat here"

                "description": "Really enjoyed the food and drinks here on my recent trip to Austin. I haven't been to Austin in over 12 years so it was nice to get back downtown and see what's changed and what's not.  On a quiet Thursday night, stopped in to a relatively empty house.  Guessing given it was a weekday, on a rather chilly night for Austin, and with 6th street so close by - that's why it was so quiet.    To our benefit though, as we got great service.  My prickly pear margarita was perfectly balanced, great drink to end my night on.  For food, started with the guacamole, fried brussel sprouts, and for my main I got the al pastor tacos.  Let me tell you, those brussel sprouts are were it's at! They were perfect, the flavor was outstanding.  The soy glaze that's on top is delicious.  While the guacamole itself was great, the chips were a total let down.  For a taco joint, you'd think they'd fry up some fresh chips - these were sadly not - but good enough to get that guac to the mouth.  My al pastor tacos were pretty good, but I would have loved a little more char on the pork.  The pineapple was a refreshing topping, just enough not to be overwhelming.  Again, service was great, not too intrusive and at a good pace.  Def. look forward to coming back here when I return in March!"

A friend and I split a bunch of things off their bar snack menu. The deviled eggs with pickled mustard seeds and bacon were fine, but the mustard seed was a weird addition that managed to completely mask the bacon. The carnitas tacos were bland, couldn't taste the salsa verde. The Chimichurri tacos were better, the steak was nice, but again the flavor was mellow at best.   The tots absolutely stole the show though, this is what you should order. Tater tots covered in fried cheese curds, poblano gravy, and a sunny side up egg. This was hard to finish because of its density but is so good you'll put yourself through the pain to try!"

Bad thing is they don't open till 4pm, good thing is they are open till midnight or later depending on the night.   Decent size full bar located in the back of the restaurant. Great selection of local craft beers and some that are local!  Then there are the tacos, they come out really really fast after you order them, bad thing is they come really fast after you order them .  They are lukewarm at best.

                "description": "When our first choice for dinner didn't pull through we were desperate to find a quick (we had less than an hour!) and tasty place to find dinner. It also needed to seat 7 of us... oh and it was a Saturday night.   That's a lot of requests, right?   Well lucky for us, Yelp found us Austin Taco Project. You would never know that this was inside the Hyatt hotel, but it is! And it's pretty darn cute.   It's divided into two sections - the bar and seated. Both of which will get you a waiter. We opted for the bar area and were super comfortable. Our waiter was amazing and everything you'd want in a waiter. Unfortunately his name escapes me, but he was pretty darn fabulous. Quick, efficient, even taking off a drink that never arrived (totally not his fault) yet still giving the drink to our friend in the end.   The tacos at this place were all over the map - and I like it like that! A little different, a little strange, but still familiar. I ordered the Umami Taco which was both vegan and gluten free (not that it matters to me) but I do love anything mushroom. The waiter indicated it was salty and suggested I add avocado to cut the salt. He was so right! I do love me some salty things but the avocado was exactly what was needed - and some lime!   I also ordered the deviled eggs . Why? Because I always order deviled eggs. And they didn't disappoint! A great treat on a hot day!   Cocktails were splendid and on point. And everything on the menu was a delight.   Definitely look to this spot for a quick cocktail and bite with friends!"

                "description": "My friends and I came here for dinner on our first night in Austin and had a decent meal. I had made a reservation in advance, but it wasn't super necessary as the restaurant wasn't crowded around 8pm.  To start, we all split an order of Tots (fried cheese curd, poblano gravy, and a sunny side egg) and the Elote (charred corn, chipotle aioli, queso fresco, cilantro). Both were super delicious, and far surpassed the tacos I ordered for my main meal. I got an order of the Umami Tofu (mushroom mix, fennel salad, and candied ginger). Having candied ginger on a taco was a super interesting experience, and honestly I'm not mad about it. Overall the tacos were decent but a little cold and incredibly oily.   I appreciate what Austin Taco Project is trying to do with unique taco creations, even if they don't always work out, but honestly my biggest complaint is about the slow service. Despite the restaurant being relatively empty and our waiter standing 15 feet away from our table for the majority of the night, he visited our table very infrequently to check on us.   Overall it's not a bad spot, but the food quality and service could definitely use some improvements."

                "description": "Parents, hubby and I landed here after a particularly harrowing travel day. We were eager to get our grub on and this place sounded nice so we trekked 5 minutes on foot to get here.  I was a little turned off by the host taking leading (?) us to the table, leaving the menus on the table and walking off without pausing to see us to our seats. He continued walking off without saying another word or a backward glance at us. It was like he went for a stroll, slowed down to leave some menus on a random table and went on his merry way. Mind you, the place was mostly empty so he wasn't like, rushing back to seat more people.  Anyway, our server came by in short order and took our order. To start, we ordered the onion dip, the ribs, deviled eggs and the elote. I definitely recommend the elote which was delicious and quickly devoured, followed by possibly the onion dip. It did double duty as saucing for the tacos (more on that later).  My parents enjoyed the ribs. I abstained.   As for the deviled eggs...I'm willing to allow may be it was just this batch but we're fairly confident this gave me the runs all night and some of the morning, too. I ate 75% of the dish while hubby ate the rest. He had diarrhea once that night.  Parents were fine because they didn't have any. In any case, they tasted a-ok, maybe a bit on the tangy side.   For mains, we shared some carne asada tacos (x4), brisket tacos (x4), carnitas (x2) and Eisben (x2).  The two types of beef tacos were just ok in our book, both leaning towards the dry side. The carne asada was a bit extra dry, hence why I decided to throw some onion dip on top. In contrast, the carnitas were really great as was the Eisben, also a pork-based taco.  For drinks, I ordered the sea foam paloma which didn't do it for me. Can't say why...I think I would just preferred a salt rim, I think.  Anyway, our server was nice and professional...got us our requests in short order so that was a plus. However, I don't think I would make this a repeat."

We made a reservation through Yelp (nice option!) but were the only ones there when we arrived.  It was only 5:30 so it was on the earlier side.  When we left the place was pretty full.  Our server was very friendly and nice.  She was helpful in answering questions - they definitely get 5 stars for service.  The food options were ok - not bad but.  I ordered 1 shrimp taco and one of the al pastor on her recommendation.  I eat Keto so she said they could serve mine on lettuce instead of a tortilla.  I appreciated that.  the shrimp taco was $7.50 for 1 taco (See pic) and it had exactly 3 shrimp in it.  It was very salty as well.  I liked the flavor but it was salty for sure.  The pastor taco was fine - nothing special but it was more filling since I just had those 2 on some lettuce.    In the picture on Yelp and on their menu they showed an amazing looking dip with pork rinds as the dippers and since I eat Keto, I was excited but they didn't have that on the menu so I didn't get to eat any of it.  I am attaching a photo of our bill so you can see what we ate and the related costs.  This place is located inside the downtown Hilton hotel - directly across from the convention center.  They validate parking so you can park in the Hilton garage to eat here - this was a bonus for us!"

I appreciate the nice decor but the restaurant looks closed from the outside due to all the art and graphics covering the walls and windows.  The waitress we had was very rude and did not seem like she enjoyed her job. My group of 4 girls ended up ordering some tots for appetizer and doubles of 2 different types of tacos. The tots were good, but we were all very disappointed by the tacos. Does not taste authentic and the price tag was just too high for the quality."

The decor was awesome with a large bar area showing the games along with a seating area. This place is nicely AC'd (thank goodness!) and our server was very attentive in taking our orders and making sure we had everything we needed.  We got two drinks (incredible) and three tacos.

The service is really slow even though me and my wife are like one of 4 tables to serve here at the moment.   Why is this place called Austin Taco Project? There is nothing Austin about this place. The flavor is average and most importantly you can easily make a better taco at home for yourself.   The best taco here is not even better than the worst taco at Tacodeli/Torchys. Why the heck did I come here?? 400+ ratings with four stars?! Ridiculous.   Save your money. Go to a better taco joint."

We went to the 6th street area and saw a small taco stand. I got a quesadilla and my friends got tacos. They weren't happy with the tacos so I told them we should check out Austin Taco Project.   We arrived at Austin Taco Project. We were quickly seated. The waitress was nice and attentive. The decor was modern and funky. We all wanted to try their tacos since that's what this place is popular for. We went with the safe choice of chicken tacos. I must say that I really liked the Pollo tacos. The chicken meat was tasty, well seasoned, and tender. The Pollo taco was very good. My friend got the beef taco and didn't like it. The beef meat was greasy and she said it didn't taste good. You get two tacos $7.25. I felt it was a decent value for two delicious chicken tacos!"

                "description": "I would give this place a 7/10 if that was an option  Pros: - liked the ability to make a reservation online, and our table was ready when we arrived - cheap appetizers that we all enjoyed (the corn and Brussels sprouts especially) - good range of taco options - they were able to remove the nuts from the Brussels sprouts due to an allergy (but went around it in a weird way, with one server saying they were about to deliver it and to watch out because it had nuts... even though we had explicitly told them our allergies and asked if there were issues. They ended up having left them off but when we asked to have without while waiting for the dish, she implied that it was made and not going to be adjusted, which was... odd)  Cons: - didn't answer their phone when I called (twice) earlier in the evening to ask about a few menu items related to allergies, meaning I had to do this at the table instead  - none of the tacos we had were that impressive... or really spoke to Austin's experience in this realm. Overly experimental in a way that kind of missed the point - not a lot going on in terms of ambiance"

And the bar?  Hand mixed, infused and crafted drinks are awesome.   Had the Putine -- or at least their spin on it -- and it was outstanding!  Tots instead of fries. Brisket.  Poblano gravy.  And, of course, egg on top.  Brilliantly delicious.   The drinks are amazing.  We had the pleasure of the bar manager showing us how they aged, infused and made ingredients for every drink.  There is a perennial favorite that uses \"seafoam\".  The bar manager let us try some -- EXACTLY like tasting ocean water.  It mingles with citrus flavors when on its drink. I had a bourbon based drink that was blended and aged in their own oak that had incredible smoky, earthy, spice flavor.  They also have a very unique craft brew list here with flights that are worth your while.   TIP: locals park in Hilton garage and parking will be validated here."

Walking through some big doors and headed inside to sit down at a table.  I was pretty tired from walking around downtown so I ordered a drink, and looked at their menu. I ordered Brisket tacos, and the order comes with two.  There were not too many people here but was nice to sit and relax.   I noticed a musician was setting up for the evening.  Soon my tacos were brought to me.  I took a bite and wow it was really good.  The soft brisket had excellent flavor and enjoyed the first one.  And then my wife showed up wondering what I was eating.  She could smell the tacos and headed straight to my second one.  She at most of it before I could get it back from her. She ordered a drink too and just hung out a bit.  I was really impressed and definitely will return to enjoy more tasty tacos."

We initially stopped in after a nearby restaurant had a 1.5+ hour wait, and I'm really glad we did!  The staff at Quickie Pickie is super friendly, and quite helpful in making suggestions for coffees and tacos as well. The tacos are pretty decently sized, so I'd say 2-3 would be a good quantity for the average person. I personally got 3 and was stuffed by the end of them. There are a good amount of small tables inside and outside so it was fairly easy for us to nab a spot even at lunch on a weekend.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking out Quickie Pickie if you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat!"

The staff didn't seem to be too inviting, but they were quite busy stocking the shelves and tending to the store itself. The beers on tap were great and very affordable. The grocery items were all slightly expensive, but were quite diverse - tons of vegan and dairy free ice cream options if that's your thing. Can't wait to go back and try the tacos. I think this place is a great pre-game or before dinner drink option without any frills."

They also had a wide variety of red wines and non-alcoholic drinks. They provide free WiFi (password is winebeer) and have lots of seating inside and outside. This would be a great place to camp out with your computer and work offsite. There is a restaurant that serves hot food but you can also grab some quick refrigerated bites that are in a fridge on the right side of the place. I got the Waistline and it was pretty good, it was pretty dry. They serve their sandwiches with ruffle-style potato chips. I wouldn't come back for the sandwich but I do appreciate the beer variety!"

After placing my order along with the orders of my 3 family members, we took a seat and patiently anticipated the arrival of our food. After about 30 minutes I walked up to the cashier and asked about the food, he said he would ask about it.. Moments later the long haired man with the attitude called me back to the counter and handed me a bag of cold bagals and tacos \" I called this order like 3 times he snapped.\" (This I knew was untrue because I had 4 pairs of ears intently watching and listening for every single order that was placed.) Why he was so hostile, I cannot say. When I unbagged the food I noticed we were short a bagal. I went back to the man and asked for the bagal they had forgotten. He found the receipt which had no 'classic bagal' on it. Of course this meant nothing to me other than another mistake on their part and inconvenience for me. To my surprise he actually rung up an order for a classic bagal. \"That will be 6.50$\" I looked at him half shocked by what I was hearing. \"I don't have any intention of paying for that\" I replied. \"Ok well just get out then.\" He sneered. I understand it I hard to find good labor these days. But never have I been so appalled by any establishments customer service."

It is such an Austin spot. The inside is kind of like a bodega, but they have a working kitchen and coffee bar. We arrived 5min til 2PM when they switch to their afternoon menu. The girl behind the register told us to make a quick decision because once they put the breakfast stuff up they do not pull it out again even if you were in line. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese taco. This is my go to order when getting breakfast tacos. I had considered getting two, but I'm glad I didn't. Those things are loaded! I took advantage of the three different salsas that you can put on your tacos as well.  Our group sat outside on the front porch. It was nice and seclusive. We forgot there there was traffic driving right by on the busy street."

I've never made use of their grocery function, but options seem limited, though I guess it's a convenient spot (instead of going all the way to an HEB or something). Didn't make note of the prices though. The food was fast and filling, prices are alright, just seems like a good place to drop by if you're in a pinch.  I should warn though that there isn't too much seating, especially inside. Parking can also be inconvenient. Not bad over all, would come back if I needed to."

Then when I asked about it, the lady simply said \"you can't order online.\" Yet, they're on DoorDash??? Both hand sanitizer dispensers were empty, and there were none next to the register despite the fact that they make you sign a paper with a pen - even if you use ApplePay. Food was fine. Not worth the anxiety levels provoked by this experience."

I used to work down the street and without exaggeration would come here like 4/7 days a week.   I always LOVED how it was like a small grocery and had a few isles worth of thoughtful products to choose from along with their actual menu.   The avocado and vegan tacos were my favourite--they PACKED them so you definitely get your money's worth.   Staff was always friendly and talkative. Wait times were never longer than they needed to be."

I forgot what breakfast taco I get, but it has avocado, bacon, egg... and jack cheese? I top it with the spicy salsa  it's soooooooo good. Everyone, please go and try it.   This place is like a mini mart, but with awesome food and natural/organic drinks and snacks.   Service is a hit or miss, but I don't care, they just take your order at the register, not like you have to sing kumbaya."

Their queso has beer in it, hence the name, which I thought made it taste funky. The burger patty was cooked to perfection. The bun was ok, better than some, and at least it was toasted. The pickles on the side also tasted funky but I couldn't tell if that was a sign they're \"higher end\" or cheaper than standard dill spears. My side of onion rings was the best part of the meal. Portions were huge and service was good."

There were not a whole options in the specific area aside from burger joints and a Chili's. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and I am glad I did. When you first walk in, it is very dark and gives you a dive bar feel, which is totally fine with me. After looking at the food menu, I wanted to try everything. We opted for the pear, fig and Brie pizza and the Ruben pizza. Both were probably some of the best pizzas we had had in a very long time. The bartender and the entire staff were very friendly, in fact a few people checked on us while we were sitting down. $5 doubles were a bonus. This place didn't disappoint."

First off, their mimosas are fire and I haven't found anywhere in the area who can make them nearly as good! Definitely better than most of the brunch places I go to expecting a killer mimosa.   Their prices are great and the food is pretty good. I dig their queso fries because the queso isn't thick, but I have seen reviews where people aren't the biggest fans. Their sandwiches are good and it's always a good time on sundays.   Everyone there is welcoming, no matter the team they're rooting for. Also, the reason they get five stars is because the service is amazing. They all work together and truly pay attention to the customer.   I advise anyone (eagles fan or not!) to check it out."

We were here for a movie premier... my wife friend was in a 21 min shirt film and this is where it was premiered. It was a cool deal!!  The place has s back room with a projection tv on 3 of the 4 walls. We got have some light food, got a free drink and watched the premier... it was pretty good!  The location is loud, lots of bar people, large outdoor seating area... like I said it is a bar with some interesting food.  Bartenders were fun, quick and on top of their game!

My friends also got lots of drinks and I didn't hear any complaints coming from them so....I think it's safe to say that it lives up to its reputation as a good pub/bar.   The entire location appears to be dedicated to a soccer team, but as a non-watcher, I can't really comment on that other than to say that they play multiple kinds of sports on the many tv screens, and they are always open to requests as well from what I've observed.   The staff is absolutely lovely and very good about checking in with you, getting orders correct, and being extra friendly. (Don't forget to tip your waitress/waiter!)   I've only ever been for the trivia, but I know they also offer stand-up and I'm sure they offer more on other nights of the week.

It's right off 183 in the middle of an Asian food strip mall paradise. It is somehow Coors Light good old boy divey without being gross - the staff and most of the clientele are Young People and friendly. It's a notch above your typical sports bar.   Why they choose to have a whole menu of spectacularly mediocre bar food (yeah some soups and salads, although you're better off ordering a burger) is beyond me. They have fish and chips - lots of breading, fish cooked well, soggy fries; a melty chocolate brownie (that was frozen before); thin pizzas laden with a shitload of toppings. It's not really that good. I almost made this review three stars just because of the food. Please note they also have \"Italian Style Lasagna\" on their menu and I am so perplexed; are there other kinds?  So, in close, go for the drinks and the atmosphere; it's all neon and cheap. There are TVs. There's also a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating."

They do offer some pretty decent standard bar fare: wings (they state they're \"oven roasted, never fried\" and I am totally perplexed at how they get that outer crispy goodness), burgers (not huge but good), pizza (especially after midnight - see tip below) would be in my top three. This dive-ish joint also has some of the friendliest staff around and a great beer selection with awesome prices - including some local craft selections: Infamous, Stash, Thirsty Goat and more - over a dozen different selections of craft on tap at any given time, plus all of their bottle selections and other libations. There is always a shot special board, so be sure to check that out if it's your thang.  And, if you Bleed Blue like me, you will be thrilled to know this is Cowboys country y'all!!! How 'bout them Cowboys?! Fans gather by the masses to Mister Tramps on game day...there's even an entire large viewing room with three HUGE projection screens that is curtained off by what else but Dallas Cowboys curtains (they support other teams as well; maybe more than one set of curtains?). If you want to partake in the fandemonium get there early to procure a seat at one of the many communal tables.    Overall: Yay, I'm a fan...I'll be divin' in again real soon! ;) Cheers!  Tip: Order a pitcher of beer after midnight and you can buy a pizza for a buck - yup, one dolla! Full menu available every day until 2am."

I suppose for a younger crowd who cares nothing about actual Irish ambience , it's a great bar.  But personally I prefer a bit of Irish music as opposed to the rap that was being played .  So In short, it's just another bar, nothing Irish about it other than the decor."

It's usually sooo loud inside the bar area/on their patio so this is the happy middle ground and don't have to scream to hear your friend speak.  I've honestly never tried their food because I'm usually not in the mood for dive bar food, but can speak to how great their variety of beers is. My personal favorite is the victory sour monkey."

Our server was part of a family of servers we learned from the youngest server. She was the older sister that helped with our order. She recommended a beer my wider really enjoyed.   Our food was very well prepared and was on point.   My wife was overheating after we ate and we were trying to find our server who seemed to be on a break. We literally waited 15 minutes before going inside to see if we could fine her. It appears like she had 2 tables inside and must of lost track of us outside.   All in all it was a great lunch and we would have loved to give it 5 stars but paying should not be the hardest part of going out to lunch."

There's a terrific beer selection, a lot of different seating options, and a fun glass floor.   There are a lot good food choices here.  The pretzel is massive, fish and chips crispy and flaky, and classic burger always cooked to specification.  The fried pickles have a great batter and the Guinness brownie is thick and chewy and comes with creamy ice cream.  Service is generally spot on, and they have done well when I've come in with a group."

Right from walking in it seems like this place gets really into soccer games, so I'm sure it'll be a hit when Austin FC starts playing.  Their draft selection is solid, even looking at their menu they have a good mix of several types of beers. Thought the bock type was a little funny, they also have sours, tripels, you name it. Got a Mcconaughaze, witty name, good ipa from Twisted X"

Food tastes dry and overcooked (INCLUDING THE PRETZEL). Cocktail ingredients are not portioned correctly, so expect your cocktails to taste different from each other. Drinks can be compared to Dave and Busters, which is a yikes considering this is a pub/bar."

                "description": "Starting with the positives, the beer selection was really excellent. I absolutely loved the Austin Eastciders cranberry cider, very refreshing and tart. My partner got the Sippin Pretty sour which was also delicious with some hints of guava. There were plenty of options for whatever kind of beer you like.   In terms of the food, that's were the stars got dropped. My shepherds pie was very ordinary, nothing special about it. The potatoes were pretty chunky and it felt pretty heavy with the cheese and sour cream. The salad was airplane quality, just some greens and tomatoes. This was also pretty overpriced even for the Domain, $16 for very average food.  The fish and chips was the superior entree. The fish was ginormous and crispy, albeit pretty greasy. Fries were sitting under the fish which made them go soft pretty quickly. The green beans were pretty crisp but it was so awkward to eat with the low quality plastic utensils. I understand it may be more sanitary to eat with during the pandemic, but they were those small, bendy, cheap utensils you get with takeout which made it pretty difficult to pick up the beans and fish.   Overall, go for the drinks and atmosphere. Plenty of TVs inside and in the patio and friendly servers. Skip the food!"

Tons of memories here with good friends, sitting outdoors drinking whiskey and smoking cigars, minus the cigars. The irish coffees to the wide selection of beers on tap, you'll never run out of new things to try. They've got a killer happy hour menu, if you catch them at the right time, you might be lucky enough to get the worlds biggest pretzel with cheese/honey mustard dip. It's like $5 and it's worth every cent. I love pretzels and this one ranks right up there at the top.   The outdoor section provides excellent seating for 'people watching', especially during the night when the Domain starts livening up with interesting sorts of people. Love Jack and Ginger's, one of the nicest bars in Austin."

I do not live there though. They said they would mail it and I would send shipping. I said okay amazing I will even pay for the hours of the employee and tip etc. Then just crickets. Their phone number doesn't work first, no working voicemail. They respond every few weeks saying \"still waiting on tracking\" even though they claimed to have mailed it 3 weeks ago. So yea, someone stole it. I spoke with a Candace from their venture group and she assured me it was sent..but, never got it. Crazy. They blocked me from facebook even. Pretty wild."

Not only did it take nearly 30 minutes for it to be ready (while other patrons who ordered food after me got their food before me) but I finally got my food by the bartender rudely flinging it in front of me on the bar... and then walked away. No \"here you are\" or anything. In a hope to support a business during this time I would have expected a little courtesy. Let alone when you are operating at less capacity. Yikes, unfortunately next time I will be taking my late night orders from somewhere else.   I did add a star because there was a second bartender who was friendly to other patrons, but I had not interacted with her."

I'm not someone who's trying to play as a victim here. I literally never had an issue with her until I was closing out my tab for the night where she proceeded to ask me what my F**king problem was! ...no joke! I mean completely out of nowhere.   I was so surprised by it that my initial reaction was to say\" its probably not the best time to to talk sh*t while I'm filling out the tip section\"  She proceeded to tell me how she \"doesn't want my tips \" and \"management would back her up on that! \"  The other bartender was great so I didn't feel I should punish her for this woman's actions. I tipped my standard 20%  and left a not so mature message on the recipe. Not my proudest moment.   Funny thing is I still have zero clue why she was upset. Maybe she mistakenly thought I was someone else??  Either way, I'm now conflicted if I should give them another shot as this interaction was completely uncalled for.   NOTE- if the manager or owner cares to look into it, I'm sure you can find the interaction at the very end of the night on your camera system 11/28/2020"

Immaculate floor displays, well organized, nice vibe. While we were there, several customers came in and made purchases. Shop could use a more prominent sign, but isn't hard to find, with plenty of off street parking.  Did I mention Chris? He's the best.

The male barista that took our order was so rude and snooty that it really took away from the experience.  If there was a coffee shop that defined snooty, intimidating, and snobby this would be it.  He just stared as we tried to figure out what to order, and made us feel like we were more in his way than wanting to help us.  Aside from the service, the coffee itself was pretty disappointing.  We got: -Texas Teddy (do not recommend at all.  It tasted like iced creamer with a splash of cold brew) -Vanilla Latte (this was a pretty standard vanilla latte) -Nitro Cold Brew (basic cold brew)  There's way too many great coffee shops in Austin than to waste your time here.  Do not recommend."

However, it's definitely one of those forgettable coffee shops. I ordered my classic vanilla iced latte, and I had one sip and threw it away. It was probably one of the worst iced lattes I've gotten in Austin. It tasted almost watery. I definitely won't be back, but I am disappointed to say that Cuvée did not meet my expectations."

                "description": "Came here in the late afternoon on a Wednesday. There were a good number of open tables, but it was around the holidays so I might've caught them on a quiet day.   The service was really friendly and I went for their recommendation of a Texas teddy. It's their nitro cold brew with some vanilla and your choice of one of their milks. With nitro cold brew being creamy on its own this took it to a whole new level by adding the milk, I thought it tasted great with their oat milk.   The two main downsides are that their drinks are fairly pricey compared to most other coffee shops in the area, and the seating isn't conducive to spending much time there. There are a good number of tables, but most of the seating isn't too comfortable and the tables are all pretty close together.   Overall, I think it's a good spot if you want to grab something quick and you're near by, but I wouldn't go out of your way to try them."

I sat at Cuvée for about 2.5 hours to do work and the shop made me officially hate Doja Cat by blasting her music loudly the whole friggin time. My clumsy self dropped 8oz of my sour coffee on the floor before leaving so I was scrambling around the shop to find enough paper to clean up the mess. 2 employees just completely ignored it like nothing happened even though I was the only customer in the shop. I'm happy to clean up after my own mistake but would love to have a mop instead of ten tons of tissues / paper towels used. I guess it's hard for coffee shop employees to care these days when unemployment benefits are bigger than their paychecks."

I'm a morning regular here and I grab a Large Drip Coffee and a TacoDeli Vaquero almost every morning. Thats how much I like this place.  Do I own some of their swag? Of course! You have to represent your local businesses or else it will all go commercial.  I love the team here - so quirky and knowledgeable about coffee. I never heard of a Texas Teddy before and they have them so there's that if you like those.  The wife always gets an Almond Milk Latte and a Zucchini bread.  Have they messed up our order before? Yes, they are humans after all. Have they righted it times 10? Absolutely, we always leave happy.  I've worked here a few times refilling coffee and listening to some great music here. I just love the vibe here. A great place to experience!"

If you don't ask if a customer wants cream and sugar (like every other coffee bar in town is doing), then when the customer asks for politely cream and sugar, you shouldn't snap back at a customer that the CUSTOMER should have told you.  And then when you bring the cream (but forget the sugar), you shouldn't muffle something as you're walking away, and then YELL at them \"WHAT DID I JUST SAY!!??\", as if the customer is a child, when they don't follow the instructions you muffled at them.

Since the pandumbic, HP has pared down their menu a bit, and it seems like the prices also went up - par for the course. I admit that at first I was upset that the fried egg sandwich was removed from the menu, that really hurt. However! The few times I've opted to visit since COVID have all been seriously five stars. The salads are way better than before, the pan-roasted chicken was mind blowing, and the black and bleu burger is easily the best I've ever had. Plus, the fries, of course.   Today we ventured out for a rare outdoor family dinner and it was top-notch. Although the menu seems smaller in ingredients than it used to be, the execution has really stepped up. The service has been great too. Can't wait to return."

                "description": "This restaurant has really gone downhill! It's been 3 years since I frequented this central Austin restaurant weekly. We order from a wait person, I order dumplings. I was brought fried dumplings expecting the steamed ones I always had in the past. This service person did not even ask if I wanted steamed or fried. She just assumed! Then when she brought it out, I had asked I think it was a she if they not have steamed and she said that they serve them fried if not specified!!really? So I ordered the steamed and told her I would take the leftovers home. We ordered Wom Kim peach pudding. Mine looked normal with beautiful crust and his looked like it came off another table they cleaned off. It was shaved off and only half of a serving.  I was thoroughly disappointed in the service and the quality of their food.  Don't know if owned by same people, Vic? I will not spend my hard earned money where my business is not appreciated. I feel they think they are entitled, very sad they think that way! K. Hawkins"

                "description": "This review is for before the pandemic. Only went here once but it was in my draft reviews.  Great wait staff and a pleasant atmosphere! My waiter was very good with timing and seemed to know the exact time it was best to come around. I enjoyed his service.  The dinner salad was served on a warm plate. It would benefit from some fresh color like from shredded carrots. The small grape tomatoes were delicious. For the entree, I ordered meatloaf because I was missing home. It missed the mark.. maybe it was because it wasn't my grandma's meatloaf, but I couldn't eat much of it. It was meant to come with this meaty brown gravy. Thankfully I got that on the side. There wasn't a baked ketchup layer on the top of the meatloaf, which is often my favorite part.   This isn't normally a place that my friends or I would visit because it seemed that most of the food is pretty expensive. I had a gift card."

My friends and I popped in for Sunday brunch, no reservation and we were seated within 5 minutes. You cannot beat $3 mimosas (and they were on the heavy side). The fries are so unique. Crispy but not greasy. We had 2 orders of the honey butter chicken benny which was fantastic, but filling. You might consider splitting that with someone. It was just an explosion of flavors. The chicken and waffles and french toast were well received too. We had a great experience and hope to return soon"

I  ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and ate every bite!  It was so good also!!!  We had a friendly server in training (1440) and he made suggestions on what he had tried (Chicken Guacamole BLT) so maybe I will try that next time!   AND...very close to 37th Christmas Lights, so I know where I will go this Christmas to eat and see lights after!"

I ordered some takeout here yesterday and got served a burnt chicken fried steak.  When you're charging 15 bucks for a plate stuff like this shouldn't happen.  The cook can see it's overcooked, make a new one instead of leaving me pissed off and unhappy with my decision to eat dinne here.  Felt ripped off.  Weather it's old oil in the fryer or lazy/incompetent cooks.. pay someone a little more in the kitchen who will give a shit."

Both were excellent.  It was more than I could eat, so I am looking forward to tasty leftovers tonight.  I also had a bottle of Domaine de la Janasse Cotes du Rhone.  A substantial celebration in my view.    The pickup was COVID- safe and friendly.  I brought it home and popped it into a warm oven (225°F) to keep it warm.  I am a slow eater, so that keeps me from having cooled off food.  After I polish off my leftovers, I am thinking of HPBandG Hamburger.  With HP fries, of course."

The view is unbeatable, it's absolutely gorgeous. They also have a dug out cave under the property where they store their wine. Contact them about setting up a tour for a really unique, awesome winery experience. They wines were great and cheaper than if you go further down 290 to Fredericksburg. On another note- Sam took AMAZING Care of us. He was super knowledgeable, personable, and made sure our glasses didn't go empty. We absolutely will be back!"

Lots of great photo opportunities here too. There's a cellar downstairs where they have the barrels. Get a tour to understand the careful decisions they made to make these amazing wines! Owners are also on site and so knowledgeable. It's hard to meet people that are so dedicated to high quality grapes and quality oak. I've been to a few wineries around lake Travis and this one is my favorite by far. The wines are dry wines. They are not sweet!  Definitely worth a drive here!"

The chenin blanc and rose had enough buttery and/or spicy notes to be enjoyed during the winter. Their reds are impressive as well. We liked the Temptation. They do tastings and will throw together a mean cheese board. The day we went we got a spicy pepper jack that was lovely. There's plenty of outdoor seating, abs that's where you really want to be to soak up the Hill Country views."

The staff are laid back and not pushy. We usually enjoy one bottle on their awesome deck. It sports views of the hill country and on a nice day is tough to beat. They also allowed us to bring our own snacks and set up our own charcuterie board. This is a major plus for me as some wineries don't allow this. Don't change this please; for me it easily earns 2 stars on its own.  Really can't think of anything bad to say. Great experience and hoping to make a third visit!"

                "description": "My family visited the winery to celebrate my parent's wedding anniversary. They are wine lovers so my siblings and I wanted to take them on a wine tour discovering what the hill country has to offer.  We came across this winery after searching numerous lists and reviews, and can I say we were more than delighted by our experience.  From the start we were amazed at the breathtaking location.  The cliff side view evoked a sense of peace and tranquility that we thoroughly enjoyed while sampling the delicious wines. Chip had such an infectious personality introducing us to the different blends while also interweaving many funny anecdotal stories related to each bottle.  It was a very different experience from other tastings, where our guide gave a more dry delivery of the wine selection not invoking as much feeling toward specific blends.  Not only was Chip a great ambassador for your vineyard, but the pièce de résistance was Doug's tour of the barrel room.  Doug's breadth of knowledge and true passion for wines made us appreciate more not only the wine but the vineyard as well.  It is always so exciting for us when we encounter other individuals who have such heartfelt passion for what they do.  We were a captivated audience from start to finish, and truly felt like we were talking to an old friend about our love for wine.  The years of hard work and family incorporated into growing the winery shows and was so refreshing to witness.  We drove back home and couldn't seem to stop talking about the winery and how great of a time we all had. My parent's loved the trip and now have a wonderful memory for their anniversary.  We've already been discussing future trips to come and enjoy dinner in the barrel room, so we will definitely be back!"

Since it was 100º when we visited, we opted to sit in the equally impressive, air-conditioned tasting room with high ceilings and glass doors that roll up in more temperate weather.   The premium tasting will set you back $14 for six wines.  I enjoyed the white wines the best.  The 2016 Juliette Riesling and 2015 Luna de Oro orange Muscat blend were both clear and crisp. The 2014 Temptation tempranillo was on the hazy side.  My server also gave me a bonus tasting of the 2013 Wild Child, a syrah blend that I really liked.  I ended up taking a bottle home."

Very knowledgeable and took time to explain and answer any questions. We tried over 8 different wines. Their tour of their wine cellar was very informative. It's also pet friendly and they have an adorable dog Emmett who greeted us. Definitely will return!"

                "description": "I wanted to visit Hawk's Shadow due to the highly rated reviews on Yelp. Could this place really be as good as they all say?! It is! It just may be my new favorite winery around Dripping Springs/Driftwood.  TASTING: Tasting menu offered good balance of 3 whites + 3 reds ($14 for 6), all distinct in flavor. All were high quality - smooth, dry, great finishes and easy to drink. I was impressed with every single one! The Cab Blend (Fortitude) was my fav. Pours were a decent size and several different people served us; each gave a detailed flavor profileandhistory on the wine, which I always appreciate. What I enjoyed here that is different from other wineries is that they give you time to enjoy your tasting and savor each wine. Not once did we feel rushed. It was relaxing to simply chill on the patio, feel the nice breeze, take in the view, and slowly sip while chatting.   ATMOSPHERE: 10/10. Its a bit of a drive and more secluded than other wineries in area, but SO worth! Views are top notch. You can enjoy the panoramic picturesque Hill Country backdrop from indoors (glass windows from top to floor) or outside on the covered shaded patio. You feel like you're out in the middle of the country on a nice retreat away from the hustleandbustle of the city.   SERVICE: From the initial email where I made a reservation to the minute I left the winery, I felt well taken care of. Hawk's Shadow offers excellent customer serviceanda warm family feel. Staff is really friendly, courteous and engaging. I loved the personal touch of the owners walking around to greet customers/chat- definitely tops other wineries in terms of service.   Everyone in our group loved Hawk's Shadow and I will definitely be back. They offer the same gorgeous panoramic views as Driftwood Estate Winery (arguably, even better), but have WAY better wineandservice. So, if you're thinking about checking out Driftwood Estates, skip the crowds and check out this hidden gem instead!"

                "description": "The greatest hospitality! Feel like I just allowed to get tips, education and experience without being put down. So many of the \"wine road 290\" wineries feel they are too busy or prestigious to speak common \"wine\" language. Not here! We called ahead, as recommended by website. The GPS was accurate. A beautiful hilly route- just trust it!!! We were greeted -Sunday afternoon-as the Hawk shadow team was just cleaning up after a grape stomp. They invited us in to the warehouse to see the 14 vats at different stages of processing. It was very interesting to see the D stemming and the foam on the top of the juice. Sam then gave us a tasting. $16 for 4 wines and $20 for 6 wines.  Very Good blends with the different combinations from regional wines and Canadian Texas grapes. I loved the \" tuck under \" cellar. You take the spiral stairs down to the basement to get the \"barrel room\" experience.  The name Hawk Shadow is very heartfelt as well. The winery is named after their horse, hawk shadow who passed away in 2007.  In addition to the very spacious tasting room they have two different levels of patios and you can have awesome events there as well overlooking the beautiful Hill country. It's really worth the drive from San Antonio. Thank you Sam and Hawk shadow. I wish more wineries would realize that your total experience is based on not only the taste of their wines but how you are treated! Thanks and we'll definitely be back!"

Perfect patio for sitting and sipping some of the best wine Texas has to offer. We sipped a good deal and it was all great. Had a hard time choosing what was coming home with us.  This just ensures that we have to come back to get the rest, and then some. Barbara was a gem, very knowledgeable and easily shared that knowledge.  Sam , another asset to the team; great enthusiasm for his craft.  Chip is a delight, and I must say best shirt award! If you are in the area, this is a must; you will be glad you visited"

Everyone is exceptionally helpful, they have a very comfortable tasting room, but I felt the tasting was way overpriced, so I decided to just buy a bottle of the Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo to drink while the rest of the group had their tasting.   They have an impressive operation and make some wonderful wines, definitely worth the stop. Cheers!"

                "description": "TLDR: relaxing atmosphere with nice white wines. Good on the spectrum of Texas wines but not on the level of French or Napa wines.  This is a great spot right across the street from salt lick. Parking lot is gravel but there's plenty of parking available. Hostess was extremely friendly and great conversation.  The wines themselves are good- we especially loved the Chardonnay and reserve wines. Based on Texas wineries, I have to say this is hands down one of the better vineyards. That being said, I have a deep love for Russian river valley wines (especially green valley pinots and Chardonnay's) and Texas grapes just don't measure up. Is that an unfair comparison? Probably.  Overall highly recommend visiting and supporting local. You'll want this on your wine tasting list of stops for sure, and best of all it's fairly close to Austin."

I love coming out here for a wine tasting and enjoying the outside patio and having the vineyard to explore. The landscape is gorgeous and the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.  Most importantly, the wine is delicious.    Pro tip- for an additional $8 you can add on an extra tasting of the ExTerra Tempranillo (usually a $100 bottle). It's amazing and a must try."

                "description": "Fall Creek Vineyards totally exceeded our expectations! We have been super strict about staying home during COVID-19, but my #1 birthday wish was to get out ... in a safe way. With young children. My husband called Fall Creek ahead of time and was told that kids were allowed and that there was plenty of outdoor space.   We arrived around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by a super friendly and knowledgeable gentleman. I wish I had grabbed his name, because he was seriously amazing. He let us know that a food purchase was required to be served on premise, which was not a problem at all because everything looked delicious (we chose a cheese platter), and gave us a wine menu as well.   We selected our own seats and were able to stay away from the party that came in after us. Our sommelier was so knowledgeable and provided everything in a COVID-19 safe way. He was also super sweet to our kids, even though our three year old was crushing crackers on the table (we cleaned up after him before we left but it was still so embarrassing).   All of the wines were delicious. We ended up leaving with their Tempranillo, their Sauvignon-blanc (vintners-selection) and two souvenir glasses.   We spent about an hour at Fall Creek, which ended up being the total highlight of my birthday, but could have spent more time there exploring their beautiful grounds  had we not had a dinner reservation."

Of course, there is wine tasting and a variety of bottles for sale.  Fall Creek makes wines in all price points. From the quite good inexpensive wines to award-winning bottles for people who really know their reds. I am a fan of their Tempranillo.  If you are in Austin, it's worth a visit!"

My mom's in town so I wanted to take her to a winery semi-close to Austin but not too far away. ENTER: Fall Creek. It's been recommended to me by several friends so figured I'd check it out for myself:  PROS: Seriously the nicest staff in the world. Thank you Daniel! Plenty of socially distanced tables and chairs in LOTS of different areas of the winery A bottle of their amazing Sauvignon Blanc - $22! Great snacks to accompany (I got Pimento cheese) They had live music on a Saturday with a full band. swoon! Across the street from Salt Lick if you want foods  CONS: Seriously none. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. Can't wait to visit again!   Pro tip: go to Desert Door nearby for more fun. :)"

As a personal recommendation, if you're trying to social distance, I would suggest visiting here only during the weekdays when it's less busy, otherwise it may seem too crowded since the place is on the smaller side.  The food menu mainly consists of cheese and snacks that go well with wine but it's a little overpriced. The staff was nice but they were just there for the most part, nothing more to enhance our experience.   3/5 staff/service 4/5 nicely decorated interior and exterior 5/5 with the right company"

We opted for two full glasses of their most standout wines and although it was much more expensive wine than I'm used to, we did get a generous pour. The backyard terrace is peaceful and has many seating options. I would've loved to see an option where you could do a wine tasting outdoors, perhaps the same way you order a beer flight.

Our 2nd stop was Falls Creek....it was so pretty with perfect sunny weather and enough seating inside and out. Covid is still among us so they offer hand santizers but you bring your own mask. Most patrons didn't have on of course once they had their wine in hand.   We opted to sit outdoors. Tables are 3-4 ft apart in some spots so choose within your comfort zone for social distancing. We grabbed a quick glass of wine and made our way to the next stop.   Looking forward to returning with the hubby this summer."

We requested the tasting - 5 wines that are pre-selected, you aren't able to choose.  After the second (extremely small) pour, we had to request water.  Decided to order a couple of apps for the group..we were brought store made hummus and pimento cheese - still in the plastic container, propped on a plate with a wrapped package of crackers.  Had to request small plates, which seemed to surprise our server.  By the end of the tasting we were all sweating as the sun was beating down on us and there seemed to be no AC. The wines were okay, but the experience and service could have been much better.  I wouldn't return."

I was embarrassed after taking my family to experience the wine tasting here. Although, some of the wine were fairly tasty, but the serving was small compared to the vineyards I mentioned in the beginning. I had never been to a wine tasting with a pour stopper that was new to me. Mind you they charge $20 per person for wine tasting. We were observing a table near us that was getting extra pour from the pour stopper technique. We decided to order 2 cheese plates ($25/plate) that came in this container after we finished it, which was a small portion by the way. We noticed that the container said \"Best By: 2/12\" we visited 2/13. So we alerted our server she politely checked with the back she was told that it meant Arrived By, which to me was odd. If it was \"Arrived By\" I think that's what they would've put on the container but I guess just to shut us up.  As to COVID capacity the patio was full we couldn't wait to leave. This is my family and I's experience I wish it could've been better."

We even purchased their wines for our wedding (white and red blend)!!! Highly recommend going out to do a tasting and hang out. Plus, there are tons of other places to check out for food, beer, and more wine nearby to make a day of it. Adam, the owner, has created a chill place to relax nestled in the back of the property surrounded by trees. Parking is super easy!"

                "description": "We added this place to the itinerary last minute and I am glad we did.   This location is not a vineyard itself. It's basically an outpost of the parent company in California. Based in Paso Robles, Graveyard Vineyards is a small producer. The wines offered are all grown and made in California.   We opted for the tasting. They offered 6 wines for $15. We enjoyed generous pours of 2 whites, 1 rose, 2 reds, and a dessert wine. All of them were very good! You can tell their not Texas wines (in a good way!).   The staff was incredibly helpful. They offered tastings outside and were very attentive! I would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.   If you can grab a Malbec, do it!"

                "description": "Our family was in town from CA and we decided we would go wine tasting locally and try some Texas wines. The wineries prior, all staff wore masks which was nice since we had a couple high risk individuals in our group. When we arrived at Graveyard, the outside was not impressive, not exactly the winery ambience. Once we got inside, the male was not wearing a mask (ok... fine... mask mandate lifted.... ) but he then told me I could take off my mask standing about a foot away, and I told him no I can't, we have high risk individuals. He then said to go outside for the tasting which we did. But honestly, who tells people to take off their masks or suggest they take off their masks during a pandemic? He has noooo idea of our health conditions, concerns or even has the right to even suggest on the matter. I was definitely taken back.  Once we went outside the table was just covered in pollen and debris and leaves. We were all so itchy from all the leaves under the table. Just no grooming or landscaping or care given to the on-site property. It was not a relaxing atmosphere whatsoever, as mentioned prior, a parking lot view/feeling.  The female local staff member had superb customer service, but again, in our faces pouring wine with no mask on. Out of the wineries we went to that day, this is the ONLY place where they were mask free. Although the mask mandate was lifted, we're still in the midst of a major pandemic and felt other establishments honored that respectfully. We felt very safe at all the wineries prior.   Grapes not from Texas.   Pros: Wine was good."

                "description": "This review is meant as an FYI to those people who are thinking about joining the Graveyard vineyards wine club.  Graveyard expects you to take three shipments and are unwilling to cancel your membership before you pay for, and receive three shipments.  I have received two shipments and did not want any more Graveyard wine.  When I reached out to the wine club, the response was \"you are asked to received three shipments; you've had two.  Your third one is coming up.\"  I am going to be candid here.  I just don't care for the wines.  I know others like them very much.  My sister, who lives near the tasting room in Dripping Springs, loves the wine.  There is nothing wrong with the wine; I just don't care for it and I think two shipments is enough to make up my mind.  I conveyed my feelings to the wine club manager and her solution was to downgrade me from a 12-bottle shipment to a 6-bottle shipment.  I really don't mean to knock Graveyard.  But my suggestion is to buy a case of wine and try it before you join the club.  I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with the wine; it just does not align with my tastes."

                "description": "Graveyard is a brand new addition to the winery community in Drip, having opened in late January. They are an offshoot of a parent winery in Paso Robles, CA. The wines they sell are all produced, bottled and shipped here from that operation. They do yet carry the entire CA inventory but do plan to increase the Texas offerings.   The wines available include a couple of Graveyard's more affordable blends - Paso Tombstone White and the red blend from that line. Both are pleasant, sippable blends at a very reasonable price point. The red was light slightly complex mix of common reds produced at the parent vineyard. They also stock Ascender, a credible Brut. Their estate Cab is actually very good- a lighter Cab with a nice effect on the palate.   The lounge itself is pleasant and airy without being pretentious. The staff, especially manager Adam, are all personable and informative."

It was a relaxing time playing checkers and sipping wine under the trees, though. Our server was wonderful and covid-safe. Unfortunately, one staff wasn't wearing a mask, even inside, but we didn't have to deal with him much. We really enjoyed the wines. I know they are based out of Cali, but it was still nice to get a decent sparkling wine at a Texas vineyard. They were all good, but that was a nice surprise."

                "description": "In planning for our day trip, I thought about checking out an olive orchard. Years ago, I had read about Sandy Oaks olive orchard but never quite made it out to visit. On my search online, I found Texas Hill Country Olive Company in Dripping Springs. The timing might not have been the best since the arctic freeze affected the olive trees. We did see both mission and arbequina a year and a half old olive trees. Under the shade of the oak tree and a breeze, we sat to listen to Cara (one of the owners) share the history of how their family business started. With a brief visit with the resident chickens we headed indoors for the abridged version of the mill tour. Finally understood how extra virgin olive oil is made and not to ever buy light olive oil!  After the olive orchard and mill tour, we joined the tasting tour ($10). There were so many varieties of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and flavor profiles similar to wine tasting. I loved getting to combine the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil and tasting with the bread and apple.  It was fun shopping at the store. Goodness with making choices though! I knew I definitely wanted their olive-based products.  Next time we'll have to stay and enjoy some lunch."

What I do consume a decent amount of, though, is olive oil, so I went about getting myself a mOOn (yes, I did just combine man and olive oil and no, I'm not ashamed of it).   Really, I was low on olive oil and missed my window for my grocery delivery so took the opportunity to support local and explore Texas Hill Country Olive Co.'s offerings.  The website is super easy to navigate and they have a wide variety of olive oil and vinegars, along with bundles of multiple if you don't know where to start. I received my order within a two-day window during the week from Xmas to NYE, without opting for any expedited shipment, so that was a lovely surprise.  I am a fan of anything chili or jalapeno, so I opted for their jalapeno-infused OO, along with two standard olive oils just to have on hand. The 100ml bottles run $12 each, not including shipping (my 250ml that I usually get from Imperfect Produce is $4.79), so a pretty stark contrast in price. I used the jalapeno on popcorn the other night, as well as toasted bread, and it didn't really have any kick to it, which was disappointing. I was hoping that for the price, it would be a boombastic flavor ball, so I could justify its purchase and continue to patronize from my mOOn.   I am so happy I could support local, and maybe if I visited the estate, I would have a better appreciation for the product, but as a stand alone, I most likely won't be ordering again."

The restaurant menu is terribly overpriced for what you're getting on the plate. Think margherita pizza but at the size of a standard flour tortilla.  My recommendation is to save your money, go straight to the olive oil section in the store, buy in bulk, go home and create your own tray of olive oils and eat it however way you want to enjoy it.   The olive oils are exceptional by the way. Infused garlic, rosemary and sola stella were my favorite. If you're into balsamic, the strawberry infusion was a surprise crowd-pleaser in our house.   3/5 stars for the giftshop/restaurant location. If this was a review specifically for the olive oil, I would rate it much higher."

Doest seem like the olive tree orchard is producing enough olives for more than a few martinis! We were greeted kindly at the door but there is really nothing to see here. We were expecting an opportunity to sample some of the products before purchasing but no tastings were offered or on display. So we are back to the fact that you drove here to enter a gift shop. Hmmm  p.s. I see after reading reviews thst perhaps large trees died last winter which is sad. It also appears that tastings are offered here but the kind lady who greeted us did not mention them sonperhaps they are scheduled or have been stopped for covid so check before you come so you aren't dissapointed like we were."

Supposedly the owner picks the grapes and they have a few types of wine that gets made somewhere else. Can't tell you how it is since I didn't feel like purchasing a glass or bottle. They don't do wine tastings anymore although there is a sign out front.   Their olive oil and balsamic vinegar was tasty on fresh bread. The flat bread was just that... flat. To a crisp. The margarita flavor meant some cheese and basil but not really any tomato flavor. Wouldn't recommend the flatbreads. It was a good idea but poorly executed."

The olive oil is probably the best I have ever had, I ended up buying a bunch of olive oil after lunch.  We sat for two plus hours, eating, drinking and just enjoying the scenery.  We were so incredibly lucky because the weather was amazing, and there was a beautiful breeze so it was cool and comfortable.  We had a variety of different sandwiches and anti-pasta...everything was to die for!  I can't wait to go back.  What an incredible GEM."

The staff was friendly and informative. We even walked into the olive grove to see the baby trees up close. The Sicialian olives with garlic are amazing. We also bough feta cheese olives. The caramel sauce we bought went great with Frederick peaches we bought on the way home. We also had some delicious Gelato which was cold enough to take to go."

We were able to snag a couple rocking chairs on their front patio and enjoy the beautiful weather. The Salumi plate was one of the more interesting charcuterie boards I've ever tried. The cheeses were on point, some sharp and others soft with herbs and spices. It could have used a bit more jam and crackers overall. The view off the porch was worth the stop itself. Would definitely recommend trying when in the area and I'm sure a tour would be fun when the trees are in season. I was disappointed they didn't have olive oil tastings going on due to Covid, but I also understand."

All of the oils and vinegars sounds amazing, but decided to try the blackberry balsamic vinegar. All I can say is wow!!! The blackberry flavor is strong, sweet, and so natural. I can't believe how amazing it tastes. I can't wait to go back and get the basil infused olive oil and the strawberry balsamic vinegar next!"

They don't have many olive trees right now because they lost them in the latest ice storm."

                "description": "Touring the olive orchards was so much fun and an unexpected stop on our visit to the area. We've always wanted to do olive oil tastings and orchard tours in Italy, so were happy to find this until then. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic they aren't doing tastings at the moment. You can buy all the oils, as well as many other foodie items in their store. They also have a bistro with a nice menu, we came after eating lunch so didn't get to try anything. We tasted a few wines and thought they were okay, a little too acidic for our palates. The highlight was walking through the orchard and seeing the olive trees. I'd like to come back before the olives are harvested."

                "description": "This was such a great outing for a Saturday morning! We did the orchard tour which was ~45min of walking around the olive trees and learning more about the process of growing and processing olive oil, as well as the different varieties. Our tour guide was great - very friendly and knowledgeable!  The tastings are cancelled due to the CORONA restrictions but we had a lovely lunch in their shaded outdoor patio. Highly recommend the olive oil and olives platter.  Speaking of COVID, great to see everyone wearing masks and the business itself enforcing the regulations. Felt very safe walking around and eating there.  And, of course, we couldn't leave without purchasing some of the delicious extra virgin olive oil and balsamic (which is not made there but commissioned from the special region in Italy).  Would highly recommend, especially if you have friends or family visiting in town. It's a short 40-50min drive from Austin."

We arrived for an early lunch and got their charcuterie board to split along with an egg salad sandwich that came with a salad. It was a cold day out, so I ordered a cup of the tomato basil soup as well. OH EM GEE this is the best egg salad I've ever had!! It was Mayo-free and used their garlic olive oil instead. I got a bottle to try and recreate it at home. The grounds were beautiful. There was a pumpkin patch along with all the vegetables they grow on site. The employees were all so friendly as well. If you're ever in the area, swing by and give them a visit! It's definitely worth the trip."

The view of olive trees covered in fruits for an upcoming harvest, the cute shop with must-buy oils and breads and cookies and the super friendly staff set us up for great expectations. And they surpassed them. The focaccia was light and airy and flavorful- a combo of traits i wasn't expecting in bread. The side salad with its basil olive oil lightly coating the freshest greens left me longing for more. So i bought the oil. We split some Flatbread and a muffuletta and both were scrumptious. I tried to talk my husband in going back the next day but we had to get on the road. Make this place a stop. It is kid friendly too. I never knew how beautiful olive trees were but it made me want to grow"

They offer tours of the orchard, many times hosted by their founder John. They offer a wide variety of merchandise including amazing oils and wines. They also offer light meals and drinks inside of the restaurant. We tried the flat bread pizza, the anti-pasta salad, and a grilled cheese. All of it was yummy. If you're in the hill country, give it a try. You won't be disappointed."

The inside is small because it's in a cottage so there's a sign saying one group at a time. The wines are from California. You can do a flight for $15 or a glass. We all chose a glass (8oz pour) whereas a tasting is 6 oz. loved our reds. There's a sculpture garden to stroll. Lovely place for convo.

They have only recently opened up, so we had never heard of them before and were excited to try them out. They had a very cute tasting room with nice stone that also felt very homey. The tasting was $20 and you get to try 6 wines. $20 still feels a bit hefty for a tasting in Central Texas for me, but their pours were pretty generous and you're not being served by someone who looks like a teenager who couldn't care less about your experience (like what Becker has become). All of these wines are from Sonoma. Overall, we didn't love the tastings except for the Zinfandel and the Cabernet which were absolutely outstanding, but I don't typically love lighter-bodied red wines or most reds from Sonoma. The quality is great, but a few of the prices were just slightly higher than what we can personally justify - I absolutely loved the Cab but it was $60. The Zinfandel was more affordable at $39. Their Wine Club gives you 20% off purchases which is nice, but it is a 6-bottle quarterly shipment. The winemakers are the Parmesons themselves and we had the pleasure of getting to chat with them while we did our tasting. They are a wonderful couple who were very welcoming and lovely to chat with. We loved hearing their story of how they got into winemaking. I would highly recommend checking this place out!"

It's a shared space with Wine for the People, just off Fitzhugh Road, which is quickly becoming a brewery/distellery/winery Mecca.   Whether you like white, rosé, or red, CL Butaud has what you want. Light and clean white wines. Crisp, but not sweet rosés. Love the BIG, BOLD reds. The Grenache and Tempranillo are both awesome! My favorite is the Cease and Desist, a 50/50 blend of Syrah and Tempranillo.   We've been tasting wine for years near and far. This is the way it should be done. Best experience ever. Reservations encouraged. Get your own picnic table outside and enjoy your stay. The sommeliers are friendly and knowledgeable. The winemaker, Randy Hester, will likely visit with you and share his philosophy and insight into the process. 100% Texas grown grapes.   Dog friendly. Outdoor games and food trucks forthcoming. Did I mention I'm so happy they've opened a tasting room!"

                "description": "I soooo enjoyed my wine tasting at Texas AVA, which is a shared tasting room with CL Butaud and Wine for the People.    First, the outdoor space is great.  There are about nine picnic benches, well distanced, and most of them are covered/in the shade so you aren't baking in the Texas sun.  There were also nice design touches and little decorations, such as  tablecloths and flowers on the table, so the space felt very picturesque.  Next, there are three options for tasting: all CL Butaud wines, all Wine for the People wines, or a \"duo flight\" so you can try wines from both winemakers.  I brought my mother with me to the tasting and we decided to both get the duo flight.  I enjoyed all the wines we tasted, but my favorites were the Sparkling Chenin Blanc (Wine For The People), the Pa Pa French Rose (CL Butaud), and the Carbonic Petite Sirah (Wine For The People) (we added that last one on to our wine tasting, even though it wasn't included in the flight we chose).  What made the tasting even more special, beyond the outdoor space and the wines themselves, is that both winemakers were on site and pouring the wines.  We had the opportunity to talk to each of them, which made our afternoon feel like a very special experience.  You can tell they both have such passion for their wines and their passion is infectious.  We ended up buying five bottles of wine and I'm seriously considering joining one or both of their wine clubs.  If you are looking for a spot to hang out with friends and family and taste great Texas wines, I highly recommend visiting the Texas AVA tasting room.  I've already told my friends about it and I am planning another visit very soon!"

We tried both CL and Wine for the People and there was not a bad wine to be had. We organized a large group to celebrate a birthday and they took great care of us. We were impressed by both the wine and the service. Thank you so much to the lovely staff and wine makers there!"

They had a two ban band which was perfect for the setting! Great outside seating!!! We got their at 3 and stayed for a few hours because of how it was nested in the hills with plenty of trees and shade.   Great place for a date, family, kids, dogs or a glass of wine for the day. We will be coming back and hopefully have traditional Argentine bbq next time.   Suggestion: serve espresso and/or coffee"

The wines are tasty and the winery has some great indoor and outdoor seating with fantastic views, way up on a hill. Definitely go check them out!  I've also reached out to the management to see if I can get wines shipped back to my home state of Georgia!!!"

                "description": "When we first arrived here, it was a bit confusing on where we were allowed to park as there were to signs indicating a designated place for cars - we ended up just driving all the way up the hill and parking alongside the roundabout next to the entrance of the winery cabin.   We had a reservation for right when they opened, and luckily so - it became extremely busy later on in our visit, so be mindful if you're planning on coming here that it's popular!   Staff is extremely friendly and attentive - they accommodated our group and let us even switch some tables around since we were the first there.   El Gaucho has a smaller wine list than other wineries I've been to, but they also had a food menu that was unique to others.   Provoleta ($12.50, +prosciutto $2.00): Comes out on a hot skillet plate with some slices of bread on the side. Really flavorful in provolone, obviously, but the chimichurri gives a nice addition to the dish. Felt like the addition of prosciutto wasn't worth, however.   Empanadas (2pc - $12.50): They have an option between beef empanadas, or a black bean and plantain empanada. I tried both and they were delicious in their own ways. Some people may stray away from the non-meat option, but I quite liked it! I believe they served this with the same chimichurri that was on top of the Provoleta.   Light Flight  1. Chardonnay: Their description is 100% correct, if you don't prefer Chardonnay, you might change your mind after trying this! Super light and refreshing, really easy finish. 2. Chardonnay Reserve: Huge jump from the Chardonnay - seemed to taste more full.  3. Malbec Rose: Really great end to tie the first two together, the sweetness is subtle but still noticeable.  They have a lovely outdoor courtyard/backyard patio where more seating is available, but unfortunately the day we went, it had just rained meaning most chairs were wet. I would highly recommend trying to come on a sunny day as I think it'd be beautiful!"

They were originally going to set up something \"special\" since it was our honeymoon and it was not special at all. They were charging us $175 for literally a bottle of cheap champagne and a bowl of crackers and cheese. For what we paid for and what we got I don't recommend it at all."

                "description": "Nice atmosphere and view, despite the lack of any healthy grape vines.   Service sucks. We sat down with a group of 9 girls when it was not whatsoever busy and were (eventually) greeted with \"hey so we can't do tastings because this is a large group without a reservation.\" We were happy to purchase by the glass or bottle, so this wasn't an issue but we were all taken aback by this greeting and found it pretty rude and uninviting. We barely heard from our waitress/hostess the whole time we were there.   The wine was just disgusting and overpriced. Of the bottles we purchased, the pinot grigio was the only decent one, which wasn't even made by this winery.   There are MANY better options, who actually enjoy and appreciate your patronage...keep driving!"

                "description": "Terrible wine. We had to buy a bottle because they used the Covid excuse when mind you down the road wineries we can do tastings or by the glass. We love big bold reds so we were guided to their 2015 Cab. Worst ever. The boxed $4.99 from CVS is much better. Wow, super disappointed to be conned into buying a $45 bottle of wine plus having to buy their \"charcuterie\" which was literally some cheese packets and nuts in a white paper bag handed to us for a total of $70. Rip off. Safe yourself the money and taste buds, and hit up Fall Creek or even Bell Springs."

                "description": "I infrequently write reviews but I feel that this deserves one. Dishonest and shady practice. went there for a tasting with some friends recently. It was our first time there. Tasting was $20 per person. Seems like the price has gone up from recent years based on the prior reviews. Not a big deal. At the end of the tasting, I bought 3 bottles. The staff came over with an iPad, charged me the three bottles plus the tasting, told me to sign on an iPad and asked for my email. She said that she would email me the receipt. I never got the receipt. Saw the charge on my cc bill which did not seem to make sense. I emailed them and then called them requesting a receipt to be sent to my email. Apparently, when they charged me, a 20% tip was automatically added by default to the TOTAL (including the wine bottles that I purchased) . Not just to the tasting. I called and spoke to them Bc I felt that this was not appropriate. I don't mind tipping on the service but on the wine bottles that I am purchasing to take home?? I was pretty much told by the staff tough luck. I have been to many tastings in the past and this was definitely new for me. It's not the end of the world but it's the principles..you know. Definitely will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."

The woman, Lauren, who walked us through our tasting was equally as sweet, friendly, and knowledgable of all their wines- which were delicious. Very light reds, European style. So if you're into more California/west coast style wines, it'll be a bit different for you. If you're looking to do a large party I'd recommend giving them a call in advance to help set up for your group to give you the best experience possible. Large space, beautiful building, yet feels very cozy. Definitely a great spot to hit on your day trip through wine country in the Hill Country. (Their Sangiovese and Cab 2015 were incredible.)"

                "description": "Nice little place but nothing to really write home about. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and unfortunately there were at least 2 bridal parties there.  It was very loud in the tasting area and it appeared they had only 2-3 people working.  They mentioned they had not expected such a large influx of people.  They did their best, but it was very hard to hear and they were bouncing back and forth between a lot of people trying to pay and split checks and do pours, etc.  Yes, the pours were very small and it was $15 each which is kind of pricey for that size and the wines that to me were very light.  I like bold flavors, not fruity and these were not bad, but not worth the price for me.  If there had not been so many people and it be so loud it might have been a little better, but we will not go back- crowded or not."

The wines we tried were unique but not to justify paying 28-48 per bottle, yes it's \"small batch\" but if they're that much the tasting should be comped."

                "description": "Was out in the hill country this weekend with a friend just meandering around during our staycation. We stopped at Jester King before this and just looked for cool places nearby when Solaro Estate popped up on the map. Wine, closeby? Sold.   Since we'd never been there before, we each decided to do a tasting so we could try their 6 best wines. Their whites were crisp and refreshing, but I didn't fancy any of the reds. I usually love pretty much all reds and favor them much more than whites, so there's a good chance my tastebuds were just all out of whack this weekend.  When we finished our tastings, it was raining cats and dogs out, so we decided to have a full glass of white and sit outside to watch and listen to the rain fall on their tin roof patio. It was glorious, even when the rain got so intense that literally everyone else who was outside went inside to hide from the aggressive mist. Since my friend and I are classy AF, we were in workout clothing and makeup-less, so we didn't mind the rain one bit. It was extremely peaceful, and seeing the gorgeous rows of grape vines behind the veil of rain was a memory I won't soon forget.   I'll be back for sure!"

                "description": "I just recently moved from Switzerland, and was surrounded by fantastic wine tasting experiences.  I was nervous about trying Texan wine, but started my Texan wine experience at Solaro after having read many different experiences about the local vineyards around the Dripping Springs area.   The tasting room is located in the vineyard, which is great. I love that this is a small production place, with a family oriented feeling, and the staff are knowledgeable about the wine and production.  I guess the owners can often be found in the tasting room, but just happened to be away the Saturday we went.  They often have events, and we were enjoying one of their Saturday live music events from 2-4pm.  They have a great indoor and outdoor seating area full of charm.    For $10 per person you can enjoy a tasting of their varietals.  There was nothing that was bad, but from the tasting list, I enjoyed the Miscela Bianco the best. After enjoying all their selections, I signed up for their annual wine club, which was a great deal, and then was able to taste some of their higher quality more expensive wines, which were great.  I look forward to going back and touring the vineyard, as a benefit of being a member.  We also signed up for the grape stomping that will be taking place in the next couple of weeks as they need a bunch of people.  What a great opportunity to be part of a grape harvest!  I could have spent several hours just hanging out here. I only wish they had some food to enjoy with the wine and music.  Next time I will remember to bring my own picnic.    I am very happy to have been proven wrong regarding my concerns about Texan wine! Thank you Solaro!"

I would come back again but not to fast for many wineries are available in the area. Very expensive for average wine. I felt my husband and I were having to hear a full explosive bragging about the winery and we didn't have the time to sit and enjoy our wine. We ordered the small plate of cheese and breads very tiny late serving us and felt they are money hungry and desperate to sell you anything over inflated and sadly I have to tell it like it is reason for my review to tell all what is happening at this winery.SO if you feel compelled to come to this winery visit and try to enjoy your wine over a not so interesting view. Furthermore the owner learning I write reviews on Yelp made it clear we are not taken seriously. Wow what a blow."

At first glance, this place looks promising, but by the end of the day my party of six all felt robbed by the service and awful wine tasting we endured.  We spent less than 10 minutes at the winery and at $16.50 each for five tiny pours, we all wondered if we would have been better off going to Walmart and buying a bottle of $16.00 Yellow Tail. So disappointing. Don't waste your time."

The Casitas are so comfortable, spacious for a studio and had all the basics.  We enjoyed evenings on the patio.  We checked out the common area and walked the area---bonus we meet the sweet resort cat!  We will definitely return, hopefully this fall when it's a little cooler and we can enjoy the firepit.  We felt secluded, but close enough to wineries, breweries and restaurants.  We cooked steaks on our grill for our Anniversary and enjoyed a wine tasting at Hawks Shadow, literally around the corner.  My only suggestion (not a complaint) bring a sleep mask if you need dark to sleep late."

                "description": "Our family stayed in #8 and #10 (2 bedrooms each) November 19-21, 2016 for our daughter's wedding about 3 miles down the road at Heritage House. We were very pleased. The McRoberts were helpful and kind from the moment we made our reservation in June until after we had checked out.  My wife and I plan to return in the Spring of 2017 for a fun little getaway.  Our cabins had only been opened *very* recently (a month?), but everything was in order with one exception: both showers in #8 were barely more than lukewarm. They just needed a slight adjustment and this was taken care of very quickly (surely we were actually the first guests to stay in #8). The bathrooms had *plenty* towels and shampoo, conditioner and bath gel was provided.  The kitchen was well stocked with cups, plates, silverware, etc.  The beds were comfortable. The heating unit was a little tricky to figure out and so we were actually a degree or two warmer than what would have been ideal but we will know how to operate them next time.  There was little to no landscaping in place yet but we knew we were staying at a very new facility.  The gorgeous weather we enjoyed that weekend made the lack of landscaping a non-issue for us.  However, there is no asphalt on the property.  The roads and parking areas are crushed stone(?).  I don't know if that would be messy or not on a rainy weekend.  The outdoor furniture on the covered patios is very nice and makes for a very relaxing place to hang out when the weather is good.  Another nice touch is the use of keypad-operated door locks.  It's nice to not have to keep up with a key.  The surrounding area is authentic, beautiful Texas Hill Country.  The Dripping Springs area is booming as a wedding destination but the hospitality industry is lagging way behind the demand for lodging.  So, Hill Country Casitas should have no trouble attracting enough guests to be more than a little bit successful."

We ended up renting the entire property, so it felt very secluded and private. The whole property was breathtaking! Each Casita was beautifully decorated with spa-like bathrooms that were stocked with all the toiletries you would need, comfy beds, and private patios. The private fireplaces at each Casita was such a great bonus, they were perfect for the cooler weather. The pavilion had a fully equipped kitchen with beautiful views which was great for our rehearsal dinner. Mary and Rob were so great! They made sure our stay was stress-free and relaxing. We were beyond impressed with everything. We will absolutely be back for our 1-year anniversary! Thank you for making our wedding weekend beyond exceptional!"

Mary obviously splurged on these things and my husband and I were very thankful for the restful sleep we had because of the quality of the mattress and pillows.  We loved sitting on the porch, exploring the property and playing with Frank, the Casita Cat.  Mary was a wonderful host and even brought us freshly brewed coffee and tea when the power went out during a severe thunderstorm.  We will definitely be back soon for another restful weekend in the beautiful Texas Hill Country!"

                "description": "My husband and I stayed in the #1 Casita on Honeymoon Hill at the Hill Country Casitas this past weekend (12/2-12/4) and it was wonderful!  The Casita has a ton of windows with incredible views out of each one and this particular casita is very secluded and romantic.  Also romantic is the free standing tub for two and the dual head shower!  The facilities are dog friendly and our dog had a great time.  It was raining over the weekend but it was still a great get-away and we just enjoyed the outdoor fireplace most of the time.  It is only a short trip from Austin but you feel like you're miles away.  Each Casita has a kitchenette, very nicely stocked with essentials, which makes it convenient if you want to cook.  We stopped at the Salt Lick on the way out there; picked up some BBQ and enjoyed that all weekend.  The winery across the street, Hawk's Shadow, has some great wine for tasting too."

                "description": "Hill Country Casitas located in Texas Wine Country!  It's a hidden gem...an oasis of tranquility...And, so close to the finest Texas Wineries!  I recently stayed in Casita #7 solo the 3rd weekend of November.  The Casita was an absolute love nest!  Beautifully finished...And, luxuriously appointed.  The Casita begins and ends with a lovely porch - including seating and a wood burning fireplace.  It can be quite the gathering spot or place for quiet reflection.    From the porch the Casita has two double door entries - one to the kitchen and living room and the other to the bedroom.  In the morning I enjoyed drawing all the curtains and opening the double doors from the bedroom.  The views were spectacular.  The kitchen has everything you need - with the exception of an oven (you'll find that in the pavilion - plus, there are gas grills on the property as well) and groceries.  The owners do go above and beyond by supplying spices, olive oil, coffee creamer, tea.  Prior to my arrival - I purchased fruit, veggies, salami, crackers, cheeses, olives, and water.  This was great with my wine!!!  The living room is quite comfortable with a lux leather sofa for relaxing chats....but, I spent most of my time out on the lovely porch.  The bedroom is a dream!  The comfortable bed with bedding that had the perfect weight!  I haven't slept that well in months!  The bathroom is just beautiful!  Dual Sinks and Dual Showerheads...Can I say love nest again?  You must try the wonderful toiletries (the scents are amazing)!  Make it a special day...enjoy a picnic with a glass of wine - I did!  Mary and Ron have placed their heart and soul into Hill Country Casitas and it's easy to see!  I can't wait to visit again!!!  What I loved: The accommodation was self-catering and private.  I enjoyed company and also had an opportunity to enjoy just me!  Absolute relaxation!  It was an opportunity to \"check out\" vs. \"checking in\" to a commercial hotel.  Recommendations: Fly into AUS and rent a car and be sure to arrive prior to sunset.  Don't purchase the toll package - it's not necessary.  *When returning your car to AUS stop at the Shell off Hwy 71. https://www.aroundairports.com/map/?iata_code=AUSandtoaddr=2453+Highway+71+E+Del+Valle%2CTXandname=Shellandcat=gas  Stop at H-E-B grocery store for provisions (you will not be close to a store).  *H-E-B is a full service grocery store and pharmacy that happens to be a Celiac's gluten free haven too! https://www.heb.com/heb-store/US/tx/dripping-springs/dripping-springs-h-e-b-611  Recommended Wineries:   Kuhlman Cellars had the most impressive wine tasting.  It was very informative with regard to food pairings - Ask for Oscar.  Special Note:  Call ahead and they will accommodate for food allergies. http://www.kuhlmancellars.com/.  Barons Creek Vineyards had the best tasting wines. Special Note: Picnics are allowed!  http://www.baronscreekvineyards.com/  Compass Roads Cellars has \"Charles!\" I still have hearts in my eyes! https://store.compassrosecellars.com/"

Wood burning fireplace and since they are her favorite, S'mores and coffee. Best bathroom of most anywhere I've stayed. Big comfy bed with a view. Kitchen just the right size. And the pavilion area is gorgeous. Loved sitting in the La Capilla (little chapel). Loved the Hawk's Shadow winery around the corner. I'll come again when I can stay longer!"

                "description": "I recently had the opportunity to spend the night in one of these lovely Casitas. Needless to say the experience was delightful. The small touches throughout exemplify hospitality at its finest, from the binder with local info and hotspots, the ice cold water in the fridge, and to the cream, sugar and coffee so thoughtfully provided, it was the little things that made the stay so much sweeter.  They say the stars are big and bright deep in the Heart of Texas well that is so true out in the middle of the Hill Country. After spending a lovely evening next door at a local Winery (yay, Hawk Shadow!)  listening to some lovely music, I spent some quality time staring into the universe, enjoying the solitude.   I had a wonderful  night's sleep on the most exquisite sheets that smelled so delightful. The silence was quite deafening in its totality out here in the countryside. I know there were other people on the property but it did feel like an oasis. I woke up refreshed and spent the morning watching the sun rise over the hills with a hot cup of coffee in my hand savouring the crisp fall morning. While the property is still in the process of blooming, Mary and Ron were the consummate hosts, making sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. I am looking forward to returning in the future for a much longer visit."

They specialize in Riesling wines here, but they do have some outsourced reds available if you really want some. They have a really good variety of Rieslings: some dry and some sweet. I was already a fan of the dry one, but the semi-sweet ended up being our favorite. It was just the perfect balance of sweet and dry! It was so good that we took like 3 bottles home   I also appreciate the ambience and the service. The sunset was beautiful! They have cornhole if you and your friends are looking for something to do, but really the environment was great to sit and talk. I also want to point out that they had excellent service. At one point I got stung by a fuzzy caterpillar, and both our server and the owner kept coming back to check on us. In general, they have a great vibe, and they provide amazing customer service that you can only get at a local spot.   TLDR: We had a wonderful experience. They specialize in Rieslings, and their semi-sweet was our overall favorite. The service was exactly what you'd expect from the Southern Hospitality vibe, and their sunsets really were the best. Highly recommend!"

What an incredible staff, they made us feel at home instantly like we were with friends and family. They have amazing plans on expanding the location to include a wedding venue and picnic area. I'm from New England so I'll definitely be back to check it out again. The charcuterie board was so good we ordered another! We had the Riesling flight which was perfect! Brought a bottle home for girls night later ‍"

                "description": "The staff are very friendly and welcoming. My group and I had the pontita white wine tasting, and it was amazing. You get a taste of 4 wines, produced by the owner, with a bit of background about each wine from the owner himself. I don't know much about wine, so I really appreciated that he took the time to explain its history, the process it takes to make it, as well as the differences among wines, champagnes, and sparkling wines. The wines were pretty good, but my favorite was the semi-sweet Riesling. Be warned, I have a sweet tooth. If you like dry, fruity wines, the tart apple dry Riesling or the rarity dry Riesling are good choices. The physical vineyard itself is a work in progress, which was explained when we first arrived, but I believe when it's completed, it'll be beautiful."

They let us know that they were social distancing and wearing masks (as well as having plenty of outdoor seating).   When we arrived we were two of the four guests there and were lucky enough to have Pat, the owner, spend some time with us. He walked us through the wine tasting and some really interesting wine history during our visit. He was very welcoming and engaging the entire time. When we left, we wanted to purchase a bottle from him and he graciously allowed us to sample that wine (as we had not tried it during the tasting) before purchase. The tasting area is very nice and open with a beautiful pergola out back.   We were very pleased with our experience and will definitely be back soon for some more wine and some more history!"

                "description": "Two of my granddaughters were in town from Houston.  We wanted to support small businesses over the weekend.  Pontita was one of the wineries we patronized.  Upon entering the building we received a warm Texas welcome.  We were seated on the patio.  This is a very new winery so the vines are limited and the ambiance under development.  The waitress shared the vision with us in detail.  I recommend limiting this presentation to a high-level with a display board to which they invite customers to review.  We all ordered the white wine tasting flight.  Pat the owner serves the tasting.  With the first wine he spent significant time explaining the wine, discussing the wine making process, and waiting for us to finish that wine.  He arrived with the second wine and continued with another detailed presentation.  I advised him I don't get to see my granddaughters much and we would like to have conversation amongst ourselves.  It was apparent from his body language that he was offended by my request.  Rather than assume customers want to listen to a lengthy presentation with each wine, provide a card explaining each wine and ask the customer if they would like to know more.  While the three of us each has different preferences in wine, we agreed Rarity was the best.  Nice done!  We bought two bottles on our way out.  Once they fulfill their vision for the property and recognize customer preferences, this should be a great place to enjoy some wine and hopefully a better selection of small plates."

But the vineyard per se is under construction, so paying for a tour there is worthless. Would recommend just doing a wine tasting with the cheese plate. We bought one of the wines at the end, and it was 25 dollars, which is certainly a bit overpriced compared to the really good wines you get outside. All the staff were very friendly and engaging as well, and or baby had a great time running and crawling around."

                "description": "If you want delicious and fresh Italian food with a beautiful indoor dinning experience I would highly suggest this spot. I came across it while searching on Reddit and made the best deduction of having dinner there for my 28th birthday!  Our waitress was the NICEST person I've ever met. Super kind, didn't rush, had great recommendations and allowed my boyfriend to surprise me with two little cakes.   Everything on their menu hits the spot but I got the fettuccine dish and my boyfriend got the penne vodka (which he claims is the best he's ever had). The drive is a bit long from ATX but 100000% worth it.  I will be visiting back when the weather is nicer to also enjoy the vineyard next door"

                "description": "Had a great dinner with my partner the other night at Trattoria Lisina. We didn't have an appointment but were able to grab a table right away.  The driveway was hard to see coming off the road but I suppose this is due to the \"dark sky\" community. Albeit, Some extra signage would be nice.   We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and these were delicious! The garlic toast that comes with this dish is soooo tasty!   Focaccia and oil is complimentary, wish the bread was softer and less greasy but it was free..   We split the taglierini portofino. It was the right amount! The scallops in the dish was perfectly cooked, the shrimp may have been over seasoned but the lemon butter slightly cuts the seasoning.   Over all, We spent about $80 for our meal and 3 drinks.  We were pretty satisfied! Thanks for the great service and delicious Italian!"

I think this is your best bet if you're looking to eat and be away from crowds (for COVID).  I have to say all the food was good. The linguini was my favorite, followed closely by the mashed potatoes. The breads (focaccia and garlic) were each tasty, i could eat that focaccia all dayyy.  The lasagna was good, a bit heavy for me, though.. but what do you expect with lasagna!  I'd probably skip the Caesar salad next time..  While not my favorite Italian food ever, the grounds are beautiful, and it's a great place to bring a date or some friends and have a picnic style meal with some wine ;)"

While it is not easy to get to, it is the only gourmet restaurant I know of that accommodates helicopters.  (We arrived by car.)  We have met Austin friends here several times and the food has always been excellent, but we all agreed that it is now even better than we had remembered it from pre-covid days.  Warm bread came early with a plate of olive oil and herbs for dipping.  The antipasto plate and the fried calamari were both excellent, with a spicy dipping sauce.  Our friend loved the pasta dish with sautéed scallops, and the 8 ounce filet that my wife and I shared  was the best of our eight decade lifetime.  We will be back again and again."

We drove 45min today (Sunday) and arrived before 11 AM - the place was completely empty.  We took a walk around the property and upon return checked in with the hostess for a party of 6.    We were shocked when she asked if we had a reservation.  Looking at the empty restaurant we politely asked if she was sure we needed one?  She mentioned they were short staffed and completely booked, but we could order take out.  Confused, considering the place still only had one table occupied, we left and went to a different venue."

                "description": "I must start by saying, Morgan is one of the best servers I have had in recent years.  She was attentive and knowledgeable without being aggressive.  She knew the menu perfectly and made great recommendations. We started with the asparagus salad and prosciutto pizza (upside down as Morgan recommended). The asparagus was grilled perfectly with a slight char to it. The pestos on the salad were amazing. The pizza was crisp and delicious. Honestly, it couldn't have been better. I then had the duck breast with cranberries and my dining partner had the ribeye.  Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  For dessert we got tiramisu.  It was light and delicious. The mascarpone was airy and lady fingers had just the right bit of liquor. The decor was a bit \"overdone\" for my taste, but I can't dare take away any points for my view on that. Really a solid 5."

                "description": "First ever dining experience at Trattoria Lisina.  We we did for a special occasion, a \"mile stone birthday.\"  We drove 1-1/2 hours to get there!  Let's start with negatives (which I don't normally do!).  The most expensive menu item, aside from the bottle of wine, was a pistachio encrusted red snapper filet.  The fish was 2x over cooked, and was tough as leather.  The main problem was it's a filet, skin on, blood line still intact.  As a seasoned Gulf fisherman and chef, I know you need the blood line cut out of the filet, even the fishing guys on YouTube get that.  Great piece of fish, tough to cut even with the knife provided.  It's not all about presentation.  Issue raised with waiter (Joseph S), and \"he could have the manager come over to discuss.\"  As a waiter, when the dish is bad, take it away and redo!  The craft cocktails were OK, not worth the $14-$15 price tag.  The star of the evening was the calamari fritti, which was great!  Fresh, hot, tartar and marinara sauces were on point, terrific.  The veal osso buco, the best in TX, by far!  There's something about fresh bone marrow!  Dessert was the tiramisu, which was awesome, until James S added to the bill.  Overall, Trattoria Lisina is a \"destination\" restaurant, but for the $$, it's not worth the hype.  Enjoy one of the Mandola locations in ATX, the food is better and the price tag is 80% less ..."

                "description": "Driving to Trattoria Lisina from Austin is always a fun field trip out into a totally different part of Texas. No traffic, windy two lane roads and there you are, in a vineyard in the middle of nowhere. I'd have never guessed a place the size and class of Trattoria Lisina would be nestled in hill country like this.  The inside felt distinctly Houston/Dallas vibes: much more corporate and big scale than a little mom-and-pop, but in a good way. Nice and air conditioned with plenty of space too. Now for the food:  The focaccia they serve with garlic/herb olive oil is OUTSTANDING. I could have eaten it all night, so so good. Like fools we ALSO ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was toasted baguette slices that were burnt and dried. No bueno. Also: how is one bread item the best thing on the menu and the other maybe the worst? Strange, but anyway, don't get the garlic bread when you have garlic oil and bread in your lap, overflowing. The calamari was ok but the entrees were amazing. The osso buco was SO TENDER and so full of flavor. It came with a little marrow spoon and was a huge portion. My husband got the crispy duck with polenta cakes and cranberry salsa and he was a big fan too.   The service was so nice and sweet and the setting was beyond stunning. I really liked my time here and would definitely take guests when they visit too!"

                "description": "This restaurant came highly recommended to us so we had high expectations.   First off, the free focaccia they give you is the bomb. Best item we ate all night.   We ordered garlic toast and it was BURNT. We were told that is how it normally is but we asked for it to be taken off of our ticket. All we could taste was char.   I had the fettuccine con prosciutto. It was ok. I would've preferred thinner prosciutto. I also added chicken and it seemed like it was frozen not fresh. Would I order it again,no.   We did also order the garlic potatoes and they were really good. They really only tasted like the cheese in them but they were great.   We ordered the tiramisu and chocolate caramel cake. Tiramisu is rum HEAVY and I mean it. The chocolate caramel cake was overly salty. I couldn't even eat it. I do normally like \"salty\" desserts so this was a bummer.   Service was ok. Took awhile for refills. Would I come back, probably not. Great ambiance but based on what we ordered we wouldn't come back."

                "description": "A second (or maybe third) run at Trattoria Lisina. Owned by the Mandola family, it's a nicely isolated property with vineyards along the drive, play structures and other outside amenities, a pretty outdoor dining area with umbrellas for the tables and a vine covered facade that demands to be Italian. The inside if modern rustic upscale Italian. They are obscenely popular, so plan to make reservations well in advance. Don't expect to walk in and get a table.  Service today by Jeremy was impeccable. He was hyper attentive and considerate. One of our party has a citrus allergy, and he adapted wonderfully to that.  We started with fried calamari and some artichoke frittatas from the antipasti menu. The calamari was tasty and not over cooked, and the serving was the size of Cleveland. We never finished it. The frittelle al carciofi (artichoke fritters) were scrumptious and unique. What an interesting and creative use of artichoke. The spicey Mayo and marinara sauces were ordinary but fitting.  As it was brunch time, I had a Bloody Mary while she had their Sicilian margarita. Both were well executed. I chose the grilled asparagus salad for my main course. Nearly to die for. The asparagus was grilled just enough, crisp not mushy, beautifully presented, and the mixed greens were fresh, and the dried tomato pesto spiraled outside was rich. She had the Insalata Mista, a mixed greens salad with shrimp added. And she loved it. Since we'd indulged pretty heavily on the calamari and their incredible bread, Jeremy accommodated with a half size salad for her.  We'd intended to have a desert, but, since we'd been such greedy swine with the bread and artichoke fritters and calamari, we had to forego.   Trattoria Lisina lived up to their billing. Actually, they exceeded it. Well done, folks."

Today wasn't one of those days.   We were seated and immediately greeted by our waitress.  She left us with our menus  and within 2 minutes came back to as if we were ready to order.  We shared we hadn't had a chance to view the menu.  She returned within another few minutes, we had decided to order calamari to start with.  We ordered wine after the 4th time she stopped at our table.  We ordered our entree, she came by and asked if she could remove our plates as we're eating some of their delicious focaccia bread.  We let her know we were still working on it.  Another five minutes passed and she picked up the plates.  After about 10 minutes she came to see what plates she could remove.  This was how the rest of our lunch went. As for the food, the calamari was rubbery.  I had ordered pasta alla nino and the chicken seemed like it was a precooked fillet that been microwaved for too long with the pasta being hard on the ends.  They did right by taking it back and not charging me for it.  However, the waitress didn't ask if I'd prefer something else."

My wife and I came here for our anniversary a few months ago and loved it. Came back and brought some out of state guests and they loved it as well. Beautiful location, great food, and wonderful views if you're seated by a window. Service is always on point, and the staff is wonderful. Yes.. it is from the founder of Carrabba's, but this feels much more personable and more of a \"pet project\" on a winery - so don't go in with the mindset your getting chain Italian. Hint: the later you go, the fewer kids that are around, which lends itself to a more intimate dinner with less iPads.  As for the food - the lasagna is a favorite, and the artichoke fritters were excellent this go around. We always get the caprese and it's always so fresh, with wonderful burrata."

                "description": "We were traveling back home after a July 4th trip with our pup. It had just rained so we looked for a place that had outdoor seating.  The first time I was there I remembered picnic tables so we took a chance. There was already a line when we arrived at 11:30 am.  All of the outdoor tables were wet and no one was  eating outside. People were just standing around the picnic tables waiting to be called inside.  I asked the hostess if we could sit outside since we had the pup. She said due to the rain they didn't have any servers working the outdoor tabled so she recommended that we order to go and were welcome to use the picnic tables.  We had our waterproof picnic blanket with us so that was perfect.  Also, the picnic area was BYOB so my husband had a beer from our cooler before we got our meal.   We had the ribs and burnt ends plate with sweet tea.  The plate came with potato salad, coleslaw and baked beans.  The coleslaw hang a tangy taste as did the bbq sauce. We both really enjoyed our meal and will be back next time we're in the area."

                "description": "This place clearly has a cult following.   Not worth the wait or money.   The BBQ sauce is pretty amazing.   Sunday 12pm was a 90 minute wait for two people. We opted for a to go order. Took about 30 minutes. We ordered the brisket and ribs meal for $27. You would have thought the meat was top notch expensive stuff with how little they gave us. And to think, for $3 more (and 60 minutes more of a wait) we could have gotten all you can eat.  Thank God for the delicious BBQ sauce I poured all over the meat as well as the sides. If it wasn't for the sauce I would have thought I had Corona virus because this stuff had no taste.   I see reviews saying they only accept cash. We paid with a credit card. There was a minimum payment for alcohol though. I think it was $18."

It's BYOB or you can get wine or beer (I recommend lone star) in the cellar that's right next to the BBQ."

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (even had a good laugh at the tipsy women imbibing). Wish we could have ordered wine at the restaurant though. I knew we wouldn't be able to finish a full bottle and still drive back to Austin so the wine stayed stoppered. My husband was able to enjoy a couple of his beers, so a win for him."

There are little items for sale like candles and honey.  I tasted a few where one was too tangy for me but did pick up a bottle of Salt Lick Cellars BBQ White.    Outside will find tables under huge oak trees and games to play like bocce ball. This place is designated as over 21. Besides wine they sell buckets of beer bottles to enjoy."

It's a nice drive out of Austin, getting a little taste of Texas hill country. Ideally I'd go to a swimming hole near by, then stop at salt lick for a great meal to finish the day.  Everything is delicious and it's an awesome atmosphere. Plenty of outdoor seating which makes it an even better experience."

With a little bit of a wait ahead of us, we decided to walk over to the cellar for some beers. You walk down the sidewalk along side of the actual Salt Lick restaurant and drool as you see the other patrons inside eating their bbq.   As you enter the cellar you are faced with various wines wall to wall hut on the far left, their selection of beers. We looked over their beer selection and picked up 3 buckets of various beers including lone star and shinerbock. After grabbing our buckets, we enjoyed some on their benches outside. From there you can enjoy looking at their vineyard or play some bocce ball. Or you can walk back with your drinks back to the wait area to be seating.   Perfect side stop if you're looking for an adult beverage while you wait if you forgot to BYOB"

Well, it was a girls weekend, we were soaked to the bone and freezing, unhappy/snippy tenders, and we were jammed in a tiny wine tasting room stuffed with other people trying to avoid the rain.  The fellow customers were likely just as unhappy as we were, but there was wine!  One note though - everyone else was just standing there, we were the only ones that were paying customers and we STILL got attitude.    Our least favorite tasting we did all weekend, but wines were good (not great).  Need to try again one day when there is great weather!"

There are 2 main buildings but the wait for a table was over an hour. Sat outside, food came out super quick. Even got to go in the back and check out where they smoke all the bbq. Authentic as it comes. Texas bbq. This places is BYOB there were even college kids with handles of liquor on their tables as if it was almost a daily event or something to do on the weekend. Atmosphere is cool and kid friendly but you can also have a great time in the winery. Definitely a must if you visit austin, it will not disappoint my meal was about $33 and this place is cash only. The ATM wasn't working so this was somewhat of an issue but we got it handled. Awesome bbq"

I mean what else do you do after a 6 mile walk  through the parks but stop for wine!   We got good service inside, both the woman that helped us and the younger guy behind the bar were very friendly and helpful .   We both did a wine tasting (I did the whites) and hubs did the reds. 5 tastings for 12$ which I thought was pretty reasonable. The Chardonnay they had was pretty good along with another I can't pronounce . Hubs enjoyed a couple of the reds as well.  Both left with a cup of white sangria while waiting for our food next door. It was a perfect day to enjoy it on the patio as well.   Would we take an Uber out from Austin just to go here, meh probably not. However, if you're in the area it's a great spot with friendly service. When we're back in the area with friends we'd go back."

We waited for a long time to get our six pack, then when we started drinking it, we noticed that the beer had a best by date of December 18th which was a week and a half ago. When I brought this to the bartender's attention, she said that she could only give us new beers if they hadn't been opened. She also said that the best by date didn't mean anything and brushed off my concerns. This is a quality issue. No restaurant or store should be charging full price or even selling goods past their best by date. I find this extremely upsetting as I've spent money on beer that should have been sold a week and a half ago. Also, we opened the beers but stopped drinking immediately after noticing the date on all the bottles. I don't think a cellar should be able to sell beer or wine past the best by date, and I'm sure no one wants to buy it either. Word of advice, check the date on the bottles before opening. Or better yet, don't bother waiting in the lines and spend your money elsewhere."

She said \"Ok\" and gave me a menu. I was a little surprised she didn't try to talk me through any wine options or tell me about the Winery off the bat. Just an OK and then she turned away to talk to another guy who worked there about \"this lady they apparently both know who's daughter is so big now\"...   Honestly I learned alot about that lady and nothing about their wines. Went with the chilled rosé. After she'd already poured it she goes 'Oh! This is a dry bubbly, is that ok?' - It was, because I love dry champagne, so lucky us. I would have done a tasting if asked, I read on a sign they are $12. I probably would have bought a bottle if I had been able to pay for a tasting.   In short, the rosé was in fact dry but really tasty. Service just dry."

The place wasn't too crowded but they just opened in November and I think people are going to be learning about this place and packing it out very soon!   They grow grapes on the property but all the wine I had was outsourced since their weren't ready yet. They had three wines to try (white, rose and red) but will be having six very soon as their home grown grapes are about ready. I enjoy dry, less sweet wines and these were perfect.

We left with a bottle of the red and one of the rosés too. The property and views are beautiful. They have two decks with tables and umbrellas to relax and enjoy the wine, the views, the weather and a fabulous charcuterie platter. It is a bit tricky getting there BUT it is well worth it.

                "description": "My husband and I are from the North East Austin area and wanted to get out of town for the weekend to pre celebrate our upcoming one year wedding anniversary. I searched online for fun things to do in the area, and this place was consistently popping up. I took that as a sign!   I was worried because my husband isn't too into wine but he wanted to go! We arrived in mid-afternoon and it was pretty quiet. The restrooms are separate from the tasting room so I went in before we start our tasting, my husband went into the tasting room. The restrooms were clean and nicely decorated. When I joined up with my husband he had struck up a lively conversation with the two dudes behind the counter. No, they weren't two of the three dudes, but they took great care of us during our stay here!   We tried all 6 of their available wines and my husband only disliked two of them. I was impressed because he's sooooo picky. We decided on the Texas Red, and we picked up a bottle to share on-site! We also ordered a cheese and meat tray and were told they would walk it down to us so we could go ahead and start enjoying the scenery of their River Deck!! I was impressed by these guys and their customer service.   The winery has such beautiful scenery. As we move into the fall and winter seasons, this is THE place to have a big glass of wine. My husband and I enjoyed the Texas Red SO much, we bought another bottle to bring home so we can have it on our actual anniversary 10/20/2019.  If you're in the area or looming for something to experience while in San Marcos, go for a visit!"

I  have been out of town for quite some time, they were kind enough to hold my wine for me  without any issues or drama.   I believe this was my 3rd visit. The girls actually remembered me.   I love their red blend. It is fantastic. I love the environment at this winery. It's very laid back and comfortable. They have a deck that overlooks the river where you can gather and barbecue if you would like."

She was very thorough and knowledgeable. She made my first wine tasting experience very fun. I will definitely visit again if I get the opportunity to. The Port wine was my favorite- I couldn't leave without a bottle. 10/10!"

I'd we liked the wines, the view was the best part! The winery is on a huge property, with an area over the river to sit and drink your wine. So pretty!"

                "description": "Really beautiful scenery here, and overall a good experience. We came here after a visit to The Grapevine on our way back into town.   Most of the wines are pretty sweet, which I wasn't surprised by, I think it's generally a Texas wine thing. The woman behind the counter was really friendly with us and was happy to engage and talk about wine. She was very well traveled and knowledgable on many different kinds of wines and not just Three Dudes.   It's dog friendly and kid friendly here. It used to be named Three Dudes and a Dog but I guess they had to drop the The Dog part due to some legality thing.   The wine was a little too expensive... we bought a box and normally places will throw in your tastings for free when you do that, but they charged us for it. It wasn't a huge deal but I was a little surprised when she tacked it on to the bill."

                "description": "Any event with endless wine and a riverside deck is worth attending. At Three Dudes Winery, the rustic atmosphere is a perfect balance between classy and casual. The wine tasting room is open daily from 12:00-6:00 PM, and their friendly staff make it a fun and relaxing experience.  The guys behind the counter are extremely knowledgeable about each of the house-made wines, and you can sample four for five dollars. Our selections, from sickeningly sweet to normal sweet:  Texas Black Gold. A dessert wine so rich you almost can't finish it by itself. A bite of dark chocolate cuts the sweetness of the wine to make it bearable.  Texas White Zinfandel. Fruity and floral. A little too floral for my taste.  Texas White. This one is a customer favorite with a great balance between sweet and tart. Served chilled, it's light and refreshing.  Texas Red. Smoky and slightly chocolate-y. They say it pairs well with barbeque.  The only downside of the wine tasting is the size of the room. Any more than six people, and it starts to feel crowded. However, the Three Dudes (and their dog) are talking about expanding the space. You can also take a glass outside to the patio or the deck.  I left with a bottle of Texas White and a slight feeling of disappointment: I did not run into three dudes or a dog. But I wouldn't complain if I had to come back a few more times to find them."

                "description": "In the town of Lockhart a lady recommend  we try this winery since we r exploring the area. It looks small from the road but once on the grounds it is bigger. They have the grapes sent down from the hill country. They have been in business about 12 yrs and do not mass product or sell commercially...yet!. The white wines I thought were better then the reds! They were crisp but not to sweet, the reds were to heavy for my taste! Apparently they have a deck on the river to sip wine on but today they had wedding and reception to prepare for so we couldn't go down there. Certainly worth a visit!"

                "description": "I thoroughly enjoyed Three Dudes Winery! I came here for a school project and this was one of the best projects ever!   My favorite wine was the black gold! They give it to you with complimentary dark chocolate! Who doesn't LOVE chocolate?!  I wish the ambiance was a little better because this is one of the only wineries in San Marcos. The seating is nice but it's very limited!   The service was great though! The lady that was serving us was very knowledgeable on the wines and the history of the place. There are obviously better wineries in Texas but you should definitely give five dudes a try if you're in the San Marcos"

                "description": "Love love love!  We first checked out Three Dudes when my in-laws came to town. I instantly liked the wines, and the vibe. Then... my sweetheart started planning our wedding reception  (the ceremony had been out of state). Bit by bit, I fell in love with this place. It was raining on our first visit, so I hadn't yet  realized how expansive it was.  There are 2 levels of deck that sit right above the river. This provides an amazing view of sunsets and allows a nice breeze. The structure is partially covered, with a stage area (we plugged in and jammed no problem). They have tables to rent, and are super helpful with setup ideas and flexibility.  They provide servers for the wine, and totally allow you to bring your own beers (no kegs). They also offer catering suggestions. You can opt to have them do the clean up or not.  The best part: our gal, Angela! Angie is professional and communicative, but more importantly  (for us anyway), she was nice. She was wonderful in offering suggestions and patient with our changing needs. She's genuinely just a cool chica, and an asset to this backyard treasure."

I am so thankful that the winery helped pretty much do everything for our engagement party, and took away most of the stress.   We had our engagement party here and the package included setup and cleanup, tables, linens, wine, and food from a local bbq restaurant for 50 people. Overall, everything was great! The winery was very helpful and even stopped a meltdown from occurring. I would recommended this place to anyone! The wine was amazing and the location is perfect."

But I can not speck highly enough of Angie and her team, she worked with us, so helpful and always has a smile even when it started to storm she mar everything still fun smoothly.  We have signed up for the wine club which is also a great price.  It is worth the drive to visit this amazing spot, and drink great wine!"

                "description": "This winery is so great! It's has a rustic country feel and overlooks the San Marcos river. It's picturesque and is a great venue for a intimate party or wedding.   Now let's talk about the wine. No it hasn't been aged for decades but it suits the down home Texas atmosphere and the service there is outstanding. The Cabernet is dry and light and the Chenin Blanc is refreshing with notes of pear and green apple. They also have frozen wine daiquiris perfect for a hot Texas day!   If you swing by I hope you get Angie to help with the tasting or general service. She captures the sweet southern charm of Texas and knows her wine like the back of her hand. I would recommend this winery to anyone. It's reasonably priced, fun and a great overall experience."

                "description": "My husband and I stopped in to three dudes on our 5 year anniversary. We were hoping to stay and enjoy a leisurely bottle of wine since the weather was nice and the winery has a lower deck that looks out onto the river.  We graduated from Texas State and have spent many afternoons at wineries around the hill country, and this area is near and dear to us. Unfortunately, our experience at three dudes left us both with a bitter taste. The lady who was conducting the tasting wasn't very friendly and even though we tried to engage her in conversation she just gave short answers that left no more room for discussion. She then told us that they were holding a wedding at the venue and that we weren't allowed on the upper deck and could only go to the lower deck. This could have been conveyed in a friendly way - the upper deck is reserved for the wedding, but check out our lower deck, there's a great view of the river! Or something like that. Anything other than just flat out telling paying customers that they were too busy to serve us wine on the upper deck.  To sum it up: we were so thrown off by how unfriendly she was, we just left, and likely won't be back.  They do have good peach bellinis though and the Cabernet is decent"

They have a wonderful covered deck like area and a lower deck a little closer to the river.   The wines were good. The port was surprising, it was a big hit that night. There's enough space and areas that people could spread out and have a good time with out being too far away. They have a little stage were two bands played.   I never saw A dude, let alone three. There were two women serving the wine, Alex and Dara, who were pretty awesome. Super nice girls, helpful to the newbies and a pleasure to chat with. They did a great job all night despite the horrid heat. The manager was always around to keep things running smoothly. Super nice lady, Angie.   -100 imaginary stars for the heat but that's on Texas, not the winery."

The staff present were quite nice, just busy. We were allowed to buy wine to self serve on the back porch and were welcomed to be inside the tasting room or outside which was near the vineyard - very nice out there.  Their vineyard was planted in 1999. That may be a little unusual for the immediate Austin area. The vines and the grounds are very well maintained.   As far as the place, it is beautiful. It has the feeling of Napa but with Austin-area live oak trees.  The property borders Lake Travis though it is barely visible from the tasting room area. There's an exclusive members only area that is on the lake.  We purchased the Claros Reserve which is a Norton grape (hybrid) and is the grape grown on the estate. The wine was surprisingly excellent and cost $35.   I think that, with a reservation, this would've been a superior experience."

The property is absolutely gorgeous - I mean you can truly just sit and relax for hours while you take in the stunning view. I had made reservations but we arrived a tad bit early and Liz was happy to accommodate us sooner. I'd like to take a moment to offer my sincerest appreciation for Liz as she made this experience so memorable for us. It was our first proper wine tasting and she truly took the time to explain every single wine to us - notes/scents to look for, best food pairings, explaining the difference in textures, where the grapes are from - I mean the whole nine yards. She even showed us the safer, beginner way to swirl the wine to really delight your senses before tasting. I had added a cheese board to our reservation which we thoroughly enjoyed! Liz was patient with all of our questions on the wine (and cheese), had a wonderful sense of humor, and just a lovely personality to deliver a phenomenal package of customer service. Every single wine we tried was delicious! We took home a bottle of Claros but we seriously wanted to take home one of each. If we weren't relocating soon, we would 100% have signed up for their membership. If we get to visit the area again, we will definitely stop in. I highly recommend visiting!"

                "description": "Came here for wine tasting and was very impressed with the vineyard. We were staying at Horseshoe Bay Resort and were deciding between several vineyards to try in the area. I'm really glad we ended up trying Stone House. We decided to sit on the patio for our tasting. I tried the classic tasting and my dad tried the reserve tasting. The wines were mostly from Australia. They had one of their house wines on my menu. I thought the quality of wines was very average. We also got a cheese board which was really good.  The area was picturesque and we were allowed to go down to an area for wine club members. They had an enclosed outdoor area for members only with a view of the lake.  Overall, if you want to go to a vineyard with great views, this is the place to go."

She welcomed us and gave us a nice toast of something bubbly and told us about the vineyard and its owner, Angela. The wine of the month was Angela's Wish. I was having a particularly emotional time with it at this point because my beloved grandmother, Angela, passed away recently and had wanted to visit this area. I, of course, had to get the wine of the month so I could keep that bottle. I told Jaramy of my grandmother and the significance of the name of the bottle and she listened with an open heart. My group also got a nice charcuterie board and sat outside. Though it was pouring down rain, we still had a lovely time conversing with others and enjoying the view."

The wines as always are tasty and reasonably priced. Beautiful property, plenty of room to space out, and following covid protocols.   We called to make a reservation but got their voice mail. Impressively, even though we did not leave a message, Doug called us back promptly and got us scheduled for an impromptu tasting.   Their tasting room manager was our host and we had a great experience.   We will continue to come back!"

The tasting was $15.   They have a cute patio where you can bring your dog. You can also bring outside food to enjoy with your glass of wine. They do sell local bread. The tasting room smells heavenly with the fresh bread right at your side.   Staff was great. Would definitely recommend."

I didn't really care for the wines. They had a bunch of roses which were mediocre. Not sure if that was them trying to find their niche. The reds were okay but nothing I would pay for for the price they were charging. One thing we were disappointed in was they charged $25 for an online reserved \"tasting with bites\" but when we got there it was basically just a tasting and we had to pay extra for food. They had a sandwich that was pretty tasty but was out of their sourdough bread. There tasting included maybe about 7 wines but I'm not sure if that was also because our server allowed us to try a few more. Didn't think it was worth $25 so I was surprised to find that the tasting \"without bites\" wasn't cheaper. I can go find better tasting wines for cheaper down the road... like at signor. I'll pass next time and try a different winery."

                "description": "Doug Lewis and Duncan McNabb are among the younger wine makers in Texas, but are rising the bar in making quality, well structured, Texan wine.  Their tasting pavilion is now open and tastings are by appointment only.  The tasting pavilion is beautiful, open, and overlooks one of their vineyards planted in 2014.  They have several acres of vineyards on site.  You can taste the current releases for $15.  The tasting is refunded if you purchase two bottles.  The bottle prices here compared to other Texas wineries are decent.    They make wines sourced from 100% Texas grapes.  I like how their wines showcase terroir driven single vineyard wines.  They focus on Mediterranean varitels.  Lewis makes one of my favorite Texas white wines, Swim Spot.  I wish they would can that wine so I could drink it while floating on an intertube.    I also like that currently their tasting menu shows the different styles of Tempranillo from different Texas Vineyards.You can really taste how the different terroir influences the varietal.  This is a great way to experience how the nauances of a growing environment affects the wine.  The staff are friendly.  They are not 100% familiar with the production of the wine.  But, can give you some highlights while tasting.  Book in advance as they are well known and can fill up for weekends several days in advance."

They've only been open a few years, and have moved from a small tasting room into a large covered patio with comfortable furniture, big fans, and lights strung about the porch and trees creating a great modern design meets Texas Hill Country ambiance.  We most recently went out for their Rose Release Party. The event was fantastic with a full patio, live music, and dogs playing in the field outside the vineyard. This winery is less than an hour from Austin, moderately priced, and fantastic for all occasions. Just make sure to call ahead to book a tasting, and you won't be disappointed.   They've been bottling grapes from around Texas for the past couple years, and I'm excited to see them finally get their vineyard matured and bottled soon!"

Stopped in 15 minutes before closing time on Labor Day without a reservation, and they were very sweet to allow me a tasting anyway.  $15 tasting for 6 wines, tasting fee waived if you purchase two bottles.  Which I did. One summery white and one Mourvèdre.  The prices were quite fair compared to competitors and the quality was there.  The Merlot was absolutely the star, but I was feeling too economical that day to buy it at $46-ish a bottle.   The patio is beautiful and feels secluded.  The hospitality was great and it was a very chill atmosphere.  It did not feel like a tourist trap, which is so valuable to me.  I'm so glad they treated me well on this inaugural visit because now they have a devoted customer for many years to come. Cheers!"

Servers are still knowledgeable about their wine and winery; wines are still very good; and now you have a very nice area (indoor and outdoor) to taste. As always, tasting is a unique experience so not everyone will agree about their quality of wines.   The best thing from all of this is there are more wineries popping up to challenge Lewis. Now everyone wants to raise the bar to deliver the best wine tasting experience possible. It is great to be a wine lover!"

We bought two bottles to take back to Missouri. :) Highly recommend."

The best wine we had all day and only location we bought wine. Outdoor area is nice. Views aren't as exciting as some other wineries but the delicious wine beats the views."

                "description": "Found these folks via word-of-mouth from a few folks in the local wine business. In the last year, they've expanded their tasting room substantially, though they remain \"by appointment\" at present. The current wine lineup is very Tempranillo-centric, and while there's much to be said and appreciated about this varietal in Texas, don't expect to find a large variety of wines here (the other two on the current lineup are a vinho-verde style white and a Newsom Cabernet). I must mention here that their flagship Round Mountain wines (and probably some library selections as well) are available for bottle purchase. The servers here have all been knowledgeable and provide a bit of wine education along with the pours."

We decided to do a tasting so we could sample a variety of wines. I wish this place had more food options (they have pizza but only F-Sun).   The patio was gorgeous and although most of the tasting are done inside, we asked to be outdoors so we could better enjoy the view. Personally, I enjoy tasting that are poured at your table but it didn't seem like that was the case here.    The wine itself was okay. I wasn't impressed by the sparkling wines but the Mythos red wine was delicious! I'll be the first one to admit that I don't like red wines but this one was special. The sweet wines a nice finish to the tasting"

She wanted to try this place mostly for the ambience as it does look like a castle. I've got to say that pizza was flipping amazing! Only downfall is they do have a very large furry black dog that kind of roams around, who is very friendly and sweet, but he decided to takeoff with half our pizza, however they handled it perfectly and brought us a whole brand new pizza. We also then moved from one of the lower chair tables, to the bar style seating. Being that I'm not a wine fan I drink the Prosecco which we actually ended up buying a bottle of when we left. Overall good experience, would recommend a stop if your passing thru Johnson City headed to Fredericksburg, but not my favorite stop we made. (Trip was in March so weather was perfect during day and a lil chilly at nite so bring a sweater)"

Not much to offer food wise as they only make pizza on Friday-Sunday. We decided to order the frozen sangria after having a little sample and the lady who waited on us brought it out to us with the plastic cup barely filled. She seemed to be having a problem with the machine and getting sangria out. She said she'd bring us more out but never did. Since it was $9 a cup, I went back in and asked for more which she cheerfully obliged however she should have checked back with us on that. We got a cheese and charcuterie board and it was so good. We sat outside and really enjoyed the view. When we were about to leave, I asked could we look around the place and was told yes. My sister and I started to enter the \"Dungeon\" and another employee stopped us and said we couldn't go down there unless escorted but did not offer to escort us. Then close the door so patrons don't mistakenly enter that room.  Cool castle but employees need to step up their game."

We arrived a few minutes early and had to wait for the gates to be opened. We were greeted promptly inside and offered the wine tasting packages. While we tasted the wines we looked around at the decorations , I loved the dragons . They have  an inviting patio with a great view. Their wines were not really to our liking , but not everyone likes the same wines. That is the beauty of wine. I'm glad we stopped and got the castle experience."

Around 11am on a Thursday I believe there was only one person working throughout the entire restaurant and she was great, very friendly and on top of it; she ensured that our wines were refilled promptly. I believe the wines are from Italy, France, Spain, and some Texas wines. If you're looking for local wines only this may not be your place but we enjoyed the environment and service. Definitely recommended."

We had pre-reserved our patio spot and was never asked for our name. They just applied our credit based on us saying that we'd made a booking. We split a tasting and got a pizza. I'd love to review the pizza but after waiting over 45 minutes for it, we gave up and left. The live music was loud and hard to hold a conversation over. The wine was meh.  There are so many other places to go in Fredericksburg- save your $ and go elsewhere."

                "description": "My lady made reservations for me and two friends at $20 each for a nice afternoon of wine tasting. We were seated on the patio and ordered the wine tasting, a half charcuterie board and their \"wood-fired veggie supreme\" pizza. Before I get into it, I'll list the positives: The bathrooms were very clean, views were nice, and the staff was very friendly.  For a wine tasting in Texas hill country, we expected more local wines to be showcased but were given an underwhelming spread to try out from different countries. There wasn't anything we tasted that compelled me to buy a bottle--but what really stood out was the advertised wood-fired pizzas.   Anyone who was paying attention to how the pizzas were being cooked would have noticed that they were NOT cooked by wood fire but instead cooked in their gas heated oven on the patio. Granted the pizza could feed four guests easily, (you'd hope so at $25 per pizza) the toppings on the supreme veggie pizza consisted of just a small dice of raw tomatoes, bell peppers, tomato sauce, and cheese. You would think someone in the kitchen might consider adding some spinach or artichokes or maybe grill the peppers or roast the tomatoes! I may be spoiled because I've had some great pizza in my life, but damn that pizza was sad! Here's a tip, 290 wine castle--look into overnight fermentation for your pizza dough. Can you not taste how bland your product is? I won't be coming back or recommending this spot unless medieval armor goes on discount."

They have a great selection of wines and some snacks are also on the menu  The pizzas are to die for. They are thin,  crispy and the flavors just melt in your mouth. They are very knowledgeable about their wines. I ws there with other \"regulars\" and I was treated like I was one of them too. Inside the castle there are little cute places around it where you can sit and have a private conversation.  They also have a private room for parties. If you get tired of being indoors you can also enjoy your wine on the back patio, and enjoy the view.  I heard of a dungeon,  but never been there. I would definitely go back and hopefully I get an opportunity to experience the dungeon. www.290winecastle.com"

What did not make sense was the OWNER deciding to cut off the entire group. Four of us did not and never did show signs of intoxication: I've been a bartender for 10+ years. We never challenged this even if we didn't agree, we did mention how the other owner never once was wearing a mask: a regulation by law that's still in affect. After that he threatened to call the police on our group.  During this interaction, I had left my jacket in the bathroom. I asked a bartender and the OWNER about the jacket and they immediately knew what I was referring to. I never described this jacket but they did on the spot, meaning they'd seen it. Yet, after we asked why the entire group was cut off and pointed out the owners lack of responsibility to wearing a mask... my jacket was never seen. I needed to leave the property. They and their staff felt confident enough to yell, scream and talk back to me without hesitation. I simply wanted my property which they had in their possession from the beginning.   Maybe they don't care about wine tour costumers but about 4+ of us intended on buying a bottle. Glad we didn't.   There are SOOOOO many other winery's in the area worthy of your money and time. Highly don't recommend this establishment, I have over 11 years in the service industry and I have never dealt with such unprofessional workers, especially coming from OWNERS.   Go elsewhere."

Also, they claim to be dog friendly, but their off leash dog does not seem to like other dogs being there, probably better to just say you are not dog friendly.   Sadly, I don't see us coming back. Too many other great choices. I gave them a second star because of fond memories of what it used to be."

This is done during the month of August.  She experienced the grape stomping and got a t-shirt. And we also had our feet in it! T-shirts are also available for purchase at this event. Since the day it was all about her, I can tell you that she had a blast. And so did we! We were treated like royalties and we were not in a castle. They have a tasting room, a small gift shop, indoor and outdoor sitting. Wine club is also available. Check their website for future events, and keep in touch to see what's going on.  They can also ship wine. Isn't that amazing! https://www.texashillsvineyard.com/"

                "description": "I went with my girlfriends for a wine tasting weekend and we stopped here to take a look. The wine tasting room can get a little crowded, but they do have outside seating if you plan to have a glass or a bottle. The tastings are fairly priced. The reds are $6 for $10 and the whites are 3 for $5. I had the reds since the whites were all considered sweet. My favorite red was the Sangiovese.   They sell the usual wine store items inside their tasting room. The day we were there, they had someone sampling their balsamic vinegar and oils.  For those wanting to take a bottle outside, they will place it in a chiller for you. You can purchase cheese and crackers from them, but they also let you bring your own food. They did have a food truck the day I went.   The property is beautiful and it has big trees that provide good shade. They also have a covered patio."

My fave taste was probably the Barbera, which was very fruity and drinkable. If you purchase a bottle, the tasting (which is normally $10) is free. Since most bottles are only around $15, this is SO WORTH IT! We got a bottle of the Due Bianco to give as a gift. The shop and grounds are lovely, and we got to play with their dog. A great start to our wine tour!"

I had to say hello this is my first time here can you please explain how it works. She then proceeded to talk. My friend and I did the wine tasting and toward the end she eventually loosened up.

A friendly chocolate lab named Lily greeted us out front and the owner greeted us when we made our way inside.  We enjoyed the tasting of 6 different wines and each one was very good. The knowledge and humor of the staff was on point. We very much enjoyed ourselves. Lots of cute things to buy in the store area. We had our young daughter with us and didn't expect it to be too kid-friendly, but they tried to interact with her which I appreciated.  Would be nice to have had a table with chairs or some sort of sitting area inside because we may have stayed longer and enjoyed a couple glasses. The outside patio was very nice, but we were not up for being out in the heat today.  We bought a few of our favorites and are considering joining their wine club."

                "description": "Located on the drive to Pedernales Falls is Texas Hills Vineyards, just a hop skip and a jump from the 290 wine road.  As you enter the property you will be greeted by the estate vineyard, and the beautiful hacienda like building nestled back amongst the trees.    They use sustainable organic methods to grow the vineyard, and the tasting room was built utilizing environmentally friendly methods.  They used earth from the property for the building, utilizing an older technique called \"rammed earth\".  They utilize only Texas sourced grapes for their wines, except for one wine on the menu that is a collaboration with another winemaker friend I am told.  They were the first producer of Pinot Grigio in Texas, and we have them to thank for the 290 wine road being founded.    The experience here can vary based on who is serving you, and when.  The tasting room bar is small and can feel very cramped amongst the unique gift shop items they have.  I tend to stay away from Saturday's as you can just feel like you are being rushed through amongst the crowds. Also, not all the staff are as knowledgeable as others.  No matter what, I have never had an experience with anyone who wasn't friendly here.  I have always felt like this was more of a homey wine tasting experience.  For a more informative and intimate feeling, come on a weekday or Sunday.  However, for $5 for 5 tastings of your choice from the menu, that is a tough price to beat.  Plus, the bottles of wine are very reasonable with the majority between $12-20.    I find the price point matches the quality of the wine here.  Pretty good Texas house wine.  I find the reds to be better than the whites   My two favorites are the Moscato (great with spicy foods) and the Kick Butt Cab."

It was packed full of a large group of drunk ladies who were whooping and hollering where the wine seller were even squinting their eyes. Our seller was nice but was pretty concerned with the other ladies around the main table so we didn't get as much attention as we thought we would in this area. Though the wine options were delightful our favorite experiences were the nice area outside, on the picnic table while we sipped our wine and dined on cheese and crackers. We bought a couple of bottles to take home and would really like to come back and try the experience again."

The unfortunate: Logan is troubling. Having an extensive background in the service industry, I know that dealing with groups can be frustrating. Especially bachelor/bachelorette groups, because everyone is typically more spirited than they might usually be. We were one such group, but we are a gaggle of teachers and young mothers, so nothing audacious was afoot. As some members of the group entered an energized conversation about football, the bride-to-be (ME) said \"fly eagles fly\". Logan felt that instead of speaking to Bob (their staff member handling our group), Nick (our tour guide), or any other member of our party that it was appropriate to walk up to me and tell me that he would \"cut me off and start kicking out my friends if we kept using such language\". My comment had been my only contribution to the whole conversation, because I had actually been speaking with Bob the whole time. I assume he misheard me, and assumed I was cursing, but my customer service background tells me that you give people a kind warning first, before launching in to the threats. We quickly wrapped up, as several members of our group had already bought a couple hundred dollars worth of wine there. On my way out, in response to me telling Bob that he was \"so sweet, I wish everyone else was as respectful as him\", Logan followed me out the door and yelled to our whole group that we could \"just NOT EVER come back\". Don't worry Logan, we won't be returning."

Crowson came highly recommended from our friend who lives in Austin, so we made a reservation for 6 people on a Saturday for a wine tasting.  They are taking Covid precautions, everything was socially distanced, our tasting was outside (and thankfully they had heaters so we were quite nice and warm), and everyone was wearing masks!  The wine was absolutely delicious and we all loved the wine we had here. One of only two places in Texas that has natural wines (nothing added).

There are only 2 ingredients in this wine - grapes and love. Henry did an excellent job of sharing his knowledge and passion for minimally processed wines (nothing added, nothing removed).  Our group of 8 was seated at the table in the tasting room as he poured us taste from 6 wines and explained his process, grape selection, and philosophy.  He was patient and thorough as we asked question after question.  He then took us into the working part of the winery, showed us how he knocked down the cap, and let us do it too!  I ended up with a bottle of one of the rosés and one of the reds, taking home to share with my husband and entice him to plan a return visit.  2019 Reviews #37"

I gave it a shot and called anyway.  He was able to get there quickly and do our tasting so PLEASE call if you show up to the door with no appointment, he is very accommodating.  We are from wine country in California and have done many tastings.  The Crowson tasting was absolutely the best one I've experienced.  Henry is gently passionate, extremely knowledgeable and just a really nice guy.  You can tell that he is exactly where he is meant to be.  I can't wait to go back."

He makes sure you are well taken care of and hear all about how the wine is made, the subtle differences, and gives a great background story. The wine is also really really good and very unique. I hadn't tried anything like it. During the summer, he only had a selection of whites, and although 2 people in our group didnt like white, they both left buying bottles of them! I believe his current season (Fall 2019) is reds only, but he may have a few of both at the time of your visit.  Very tasty, very unique wines. Heading back soon, just to stop here."

Henry, the proprietor and winemaker and his father Kenny, also a proprietor were welcoming and authentic.  Henry is making some unique and delicious wines.  While it may not have a beautiful vista like some of the wineries along 290, it is definitely worth your time to drink some good wines and listen to Henry talk about his wine and the winemaking process."

You get a card that's tied to your credit card to swipe or tap and then you have access to the wine you swiped for. Then you can get as much or as little as you want. It's a great way to try and explore new wines (and mead and some margarita inspired wines). Then you can load up on your favorite (what I did), or continue exploring. Really, two great options. Also, the guy working there was nice and very helpful. I've been telling people about how much I enjoyed coming here and recommending it.  Don't park in the paid parking next to Wanderlust if you can avoid it because it's stupidly expensive. Use that money on a Lyft or more wine."

Like, I was thee only soul inside the establishment from 5pm-7pm. As a patron and especially a first timer, you'd think they'd have a little leniency if you order a 8oz of wine and ask to exchange. I understand you can taste your pours, which I paid for at least 5 of them averaging $2-$3 for each TASTE. After my fourth taste, I wanted to trust that I was getting a good one because most of them were and I promise to god it was the worst taste to my palette that I've ever had. And Lissen Linda, I'm not a bougie wine person. But for this 8oglass to be $15 I couldn't even stomach it and asked if possible to exchange. I said, \"what's the policy if you get a wine that you absolutely can not stomach? Is that your own bad?\"  She said, \"yeah kinda. I'll call the manager but he's at another location\"   Okay cool. 15 minutes later I find her and I'm like, \"so can I exchange this wine or no? I don't need a refund\"   \"He said no\"  I work in the service industry as well and look out for people all the time. I just feel like she OR the manager could have made an accommodation but maybe operationally that's not the way they run things. That's my bad for not tasting the nasty ass wine. That particular 1 oz pour was like $4 so I assumed it was good to be so pricy.   ."

The original location off 35 is so so cute the moment you walk in. I will say the location at first struck me as odd - but the moment you walk through the doors you are transported into this little artsy wine oasis.   The wines on tap are so fun to browse and the wall art is so Austin it makes you think you can buy them (i mean maybe you can?!). The seating is ample indoor AND a outdoor to give you any desired vibe. Will absolutely be back!"

Wine on tap is such a great idea.   They give you a card that you use to get your wine. You get charged by the ounce. They do have happy hour. They have a good selection of wines. For those that don't like wine, they have a handful options (margarita, old fashioned)   The place is cute and they have a nice outdoor patio. They had a food truck the day we went.   Con:  - the wine comes out pretty fast, so you have to be careful as it can add up quick. If you want to taste first, be quick at closing it.  - there's no way to figure out how many ounces you are serving yourself."

You could tell they were glad we were new.  They truly have great enthusiasm for their jobs and this business.  A new product even arrived and we were informed we came at a terrific time!   It was so easy to tap my Wanderlust card and release the wine. There's a great variety of wines to choose from, including wines from France, Spain, some sangrias and hard lemonade. Warning: make sure all the taps are closed before you insert your card. I didn't see that one was turned a bit and wine started trickling and money ringing up on my card.  Because it's not very bright, I didn't see the wine flowing. Lesson learned!   There's an interesting room off the patio for private events.  I'm jealous I couldn't pop in!   Happy to see the food truck. Mmm: truffle fries and bruschetta!  You MUST come visit this location!"

Came here during happy hour last weekend with some friends and was overall impressed with the wine tasting here. There whole gimmick is you you can try any of the wines on the wall tap and your charged by the ounces you drink. I will warn you use a light touch on the taps as I learned the hard way the first try. Most of the wines were half off during happy hour which makes for a great deal and I also liked that there was a range of wines from across the globe and wasn't specific to one region. They also had patio seating an Italian food truck in case you get hungry. The only downside like most places downtown is the parking but I heard that's less of an issue at their east side location which I'm excited to try next!"

Wanderlust charges by the ounce and although it adds up pretty quickly, if you're able to pace yourself, you can have a whole evening of fun. I got out of there spending well under $50 for two people, so we really didn't go all that crazy.  Try a million different wines and mixed drinks! they give you a card at the entrance and it just rings up your total, then they charge you on the way out. We had an issue with a bunch of cork settling into one of our glasses and they were able to remove that pour from our tab. The only thing is that it's hard to keep track of your favorite pours because there are so many options.  There is also a ton of space to sit. They have inside seating/lounge tables, there is outdoor seating and there's also an additional event space which you can sit in. We sat in the event space with a large group and it was so comfy.

When you walk in, they give you a separate card that you swipe before each one of your pours. I liked it because you could pour as much or as little as you wanted and it gave you the opportunity to try different wines without being committed to a full glass. Honestly, it reminded me of those self-serve frozen yogurt places. I also really liked the outdoor area - it was a great place to hang out with friends and we had a great time taking photos at the photo booth.  The only downside was that it was more expensive than I was expecting. They give you the price per ounce on the screen, but once you start pouring, it adds up VERY quickly. I could have spent the same amount of money on a way nicer and fuller glass of wine.  Overall, I enjoyed the concept and fun vibes. Would love to come back during their happy hour or something when things are half-priced!"

                "description": "\"Froyo for wine\"; Fun idea, smooth process, nice spot, bit pricey.   It's a charge by oz place, like Froyo with all of the taps requiring an RFID card that you get by associating with a credit card at the front desk. Place the card on the reader and pour what you want into your glass. They have over 50 different styles, including mead, white, red, dry/sweet, and some wine-based cocktail style drinks.  They typically range from $1-3+ per oz so you'll probably come out with a $5-10 glass (4 oz) which is pretty comparable to most places.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating; interior is mostly couch seating and outdoor is patio/bench with faux grass. You can also bring dogs. The outdoor is a bit noisy, especially since it backs to another bar and is right under 35 so it was nicer indoors than out.  I don't usually drink wine because it gives me headaches and I certainly felt it the next day even after just 2 small glasses; possibly because of tasting so many different kind, so beware! Nice for trying something new but possible to get sick if you're mixing so much."

I appreciate the way the wines are labeled in clear groupings so it's easier to just walk up and find what I'm wanting more quickly. They also have an Italian food truck in the back patio area. The truffle Parmesan fries were great and the pasta dish was a good portion. Lots of cute photo ops and decent areas of seating. I will say this location is much smaller and literally off the busy highway but still the experience they offer is worth checking out."

When you come in you get a card with your name on it that unlocks the tap. As you fill your glass it shows you how many ounces and the cost in real time. I loved this idea because I got to try many wines before committing. You're allowed as many glasses as you want at a time so I recommend doing a flight! There's indoor and outdoor seating with a food truck out back. I signed up for their rewards program and will definitely be back!"

                "description": "What a fun place! It's not every day you come across a place with wines on tap. Wanderlust has so many options of all different kinds of wine. Red blends, dry white blends, bubbly, mead, etc. You name it, they have it!  When you arrive they swipe your card and give you another card, something like a hotel key card. You use this key card and swipe it before each self serve wine glass pour. The screen next to the tap will show you how many ounces you've filled up your glass and how much for the whole glass. The screen also shows how much each ounce of wine costs. Maybe I'm getting old and outdated but this was some cool technology! Probably the coolest, unique payment system I've ever seen!   There is a food truck on site with some seriously good pasta and appetizer types.   I can't speak to the parking situation since I walked from my location but I do believe there was a small parking lot."

It ended up being such a favorite that I joined their club!   First, the setting is so much fun. Their main spot is in an old cottage, and they have turned it into part tasting room, part hang out, part shop, and it is oh so cute! Outside, they have a ton of tables, perfect for picnicking, and they have the lovely Airstream as well.   But the wines! I loved everything I had here. I was a big fan especially of the Lady Bird, a drier white, and the Ramble On, a delicious red blend that is perfect with garlicky foods. (I bought some to go with Christmas dinner lasagna!) The wine is served by the friendliest staff.   I am ready to go back again and again!"

You can't help but notice the cute little house with lovely outdoor seating and an airstream, parked out front. I was warmly greeted when I walked in and asked if I would like a tasting. Well yes ma'am, I would.   They had a lovely selection of 6, to try. For $15, I thought that was a wonderful deal. The women were friendly and it was a great way to break up my trip and get out of the car for a bit. One of the reds was my favorite and I may just have to stop back by on my way home to pick up a bottle.  They also have snacks and sandwiches and I bet when the weather is cooler, their outdoor space is the place to be."

We had some rich talks on everything from wine making, agriculture, farm animal showings, to COVID matters. All while sipping some spectacular wine from start to end. I was so glad this was our last stop as we had no place to be after this. We must have hung out for well over an hour drinking and talking up a storm and I loved every minute of it! Besides my wine picks, I also got some of their coffee grounds for some Farmhouse java this week. Its super good! On the wine side...my top picks of the 10 (yep 10) we tasted was the Smok and Miroirs and Cultivated."

                "description": "If you are a Texas Wine Lover and don't already know about Farmhouse Vineyards, shame on you! This is a farming family in Brownfield, Texas who has devoted a portion of the family farm to grape growing. They have a lovely tasting room in West Texas, but here locally in Central Texas, you can try their wines in Johnson City. The cute old house-turned-wine-tasting-room is a great spot to taste through the Farmhouse wines. It's cozy and they offer quite a few cute boutique shopping items in addition to their fabulous wines. Most days they offer fresh buttered popcorn...yes please! And the homemade bread packets are worth taking home. As for their wines, my personal faves are the Roussanne named 'Oh Hey, Charolais' and the blend called 'Jack Knife Reserve.' The Roussanne is a perfect fit for Chardonnay lovers, even though its not Chardonnay. The red blend called 'Jack Knifed' is a traditional GSM - Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, with oak aging to enhance the body. Summer is the tasting room manager here in JC and she will take great care of you. On a warm spring afternoon, you should definitely grab a glass and relax outside!"

                "description": "Farmhouse Vineyards is a well known wine grower located in Brownfield, TX. Farmhouse is owned by a brother/sister team - the Seaton's and Furgeson's. They own four vineyards located at three different sites. They have provided grapes to many well known winemakers in the Hill Country for years. They use the unwanted remaining grapes to make some intriguing wines. They are the first Texas winery I am aware of that grow and make solid wines from a Greek wine varietal, Malvasia Blanca. They also make a great sparkling wine with this varietal. They started a tasting bar located in an airstream trailer in Johnson city known as the Tipsy Trailer, and quickly outgrew it. They just opened a brick and mortar in Johnson City and celebrated their second weekend open this past weekend.  My friend and I were on our way home from our Fredericksburg wine weekend and noticed Farmhouse was still open. After several recommendations from my experienced wine friends, we had to stop and check them out. The tasting room is now located in a renovated home. When you enter, a quaint gift shop welcomes you, creating a farmhouse welcome. You walk through to a long narrow tasting room bar. We were warmly welcomed by a lovely tasting room associate. He walked us through the three different tasting flights - dry, rose, or sweet. Half way through the tasting the winemaker came over and stated chatting with us and walked us through how he made the wine and gave us the complete story. He also shared some of his labeled wine with us, which was very good. They had some tasty flavored popcorn to bite on between sips. Food will be coming in the future. We will definitely be back to experience the full tasting experience in the future. Since we didn't get to try all their wines I am keeping it at a four star. Will come back later to re-review after a full experience."

Everyone was so friendly and the owners were even there making sure people got home safely!!! 100% top notch stop and a must do on the wine trail!"

                "description": "Owners Nicholas and Katy Jane Seaton and Anthony and Traci Furgeson helped Farmhouse Vineyard realize its next natural step in its evolution, which is making wine! Their 122-acre vineyard is located near Brownfield in Texas High Plains AVA. With 16 plus varietals, it has been the grape source for many well-established Texas wineries that we have all come to know and love. We were fortunate to visit their \"new-new\" location in Johnson City at their house on highway 290. The previous location was at a trailer located near the 290 Vinery. The newest locale is right on Main street in a renovated classic home. Location, location, location is everything to a business and this place is spot on!  The owners do have plans to relocate the trailer to this new site soon.  Their expanded tasting menu consists of two flights, one has the full range of sparkling to dessert wines and the other focuses on dry Rosé, Whites, and Reds. As one of the first vineyards that helped establish Malvasia Bianca as a viable Texas grape, they have made a sparkling version called Boyfriend. The 2017 vintage has lemon grass and apricot notes that just \"bubble\" all over your palate. Their 2017 Revolution is a dry Rosé sparkling made from Counoise. With strong raspberry notes, it is crisp with a nice finish making this wine quite enjoyable on warm Texas days. For the 2017 Bloom Rosé, you get to enjoy a 100% Mourvedre Rosé that is light and refreshing with plenty of strawberry and melon notes. You will be in for a treat with their Marché. Made from a blend of Mourvedre, Cinsault, and Tempranillo, this Saignee style wine may be different than most Rosé's you've tried, but it is equally pleasing for the upcoming hot summer. There is a lovely red blend called, Ramble on which is a melding of Tempranillo, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc. It is smooth and fruit forward and we believe most red wine lovers will readily enjoy. Wine tasting at Farmhouse, will also provide you with a rare opportunity and special treat!  In their selection is one of Tim Drake's legendary wines called Assistant. This House of Drake greatness blends 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, and 9% Syrah sourced from Columbia Valley AVA in Washington.  It is a superb dry red wine blend with a beautiful fruit finish that will leave you craving for more!  Their semi-sweet dry white called Housewife is a Malvasia Bianca with nice melon and pear notes with just enough sweetness to boot. Lastly, you will get to enjoy their 2017 Sweet. This blend of Malvasia Bianca and Orange Muscat combines a bit of citrus and vanilla notes for something quite enjoyable and their sweetest dessert style wine. If you have visited the trailer before, now you have a new excuse to revisit and enjoy their expanded wine selection.  The staff and owners are quite friendly and will make you feel very comfortable as they chat with you about the wines. We strongly encourage you to stop in and visit their new location and wish them well as they kick off this new phase in their journey."

We couldn't check in on time because they were short staffed even tho they told us we could the day before. One of our screens was falling off. We have extra pillows in closet but no extra pillows.  I swear our place was never actually cleaned between the people before us and us.   Serenity you looked so cute and wrap wanted to book our wedding there but you were just too dirty.  Hot tub had so many chemicals it took off my spray tan in less than 5 minutes. You couldn't sit in tub because you couldn't breathe with all the chemicals."

Next, the phone number listed is to an answering machine in which you have to leave a message and hope they call back.   Upon making the reservation I was assured everything was going to be great with my room and the special lovers cruise package I paid for.  On our way to the resort I called to inform them we were on the way and to ensure everything was good with our room.  I was assured by the staff that everything was in order with my room and the lovers cruise package.    Upon arrival we went to our room and not only was the lovers cruise package I paid extra for not set up but there was also animal feces on one of the rugs!  This naturally upset us to a large degree.  Here we are not two minutes into our stay and we have two major screw ups.   The next day I informed the staff that my wife and I would be gone for a certain time (I was specific about from when to when).  During the time when we were away I requested that they refresh/clean our room.  I was again assured it would be done with no problems.  Upon our return, of course, the room had not been touched.  When I went to the staff and complained they stated that they again were sorry for the failure and would rectify it quickly....  We had just a little time before our wine tour and needed back in our room to get ready.  So I politely went into the room and asked the maid how much longer she would need to finish our room.  The maid gave me attitude and disrespectfully said another five minutes.  Even after this insult I again was polite to the maid and thanked her for her efforts, she in turn ignored me.   This was a disaster of a three year anniversary celebration for me and my wife. I would give zero stars if I could.  For the amount of money I spent there, I expected far better customer service and professionalism.  I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone."

We arrived at 10pm and there was no light on the 75 yard flagstone walk to our cabin. The place was nice but the exterior deck with hot tub had over grown weeds all near the outdoor seating and bugs were crawling everywhere. The next day Saturday, I asked if they could cut the weeds back, they said no. Can you imagine?!? We paid $67.00 for a $20 brunch voucher on Sunday which was a joke. Place needs updating and needs to be more accommodated to people arriving at night. Refused to negotiate a partial refund. So bad service gets bad reviews. No excuse. Poor management and ownership. They said my expectations were too high????!!! Make sure everything is right because it won't get fixed the next day. Avoid this place"

Each morning a delicious breakfast was delivered to our door, and when we were done all we had to do was put the tray outside and the staff discreetly came out to pick it up. The sunset views were spectacular, and watching the deer walk around during the evenings was the perfect way to end our day. We cannot wait to visit again!"

I would have given it a Ten but the property is about 8 miles outside of town where all the happenings are. If you love the country and rural areas then this is the place. The cottage was very nice and a huge heart shaped tub for 2 people but no shower. There is a bunch of cats on the premises and my saw a pregnant fox. Hey Welcome to Wimberley Texas."

I was originally told it was okay, the manager called me back and said can't do it because there no one available to clean the rooms in a Sunday. My stay isn't till June 3rd surely there is a way to make an extra day happen in the beginning."

                "description": "We had a wonderful stay at Serenity Farm House Inn! They were so kind and welcoming to us. We stayed in the bungalow named, \"Merci Mimi\". It is an \"upgraded\" one with a hot tub! The property is located off of the busy highways, so it is always peaceful and relaxing out there!   When we arrived we were able to park near the cluster of bungalows and were welcomed with some fresh sangria wine! The hot tub was already up and running for us and they had a few coupons for certain shops/restaurants around the town for us!   As we explored around the grounds, we found they have a pen of a few rescue animals like donkeys, goats, and pigs which was a unique touch. The pool was also located near the houses and was small but had a beautiful view (as seen in pictures).   The houses were very nice and well kept. They had plenty of towels, kitchen supplies (everything you would need to cook), the kitchen appliances were in great shape and worked great! One thing we had some issues with is the ac unit, there was one in the bedroom, which I liked, and one in the living/kitchen area. They were just kind of complicated to use, we sat up late one night, with the handy manual they had laminated for us, trying to get it to keep the fan on while we slept. What I would suggest is having a ceiling fan in the bedroom or at least an easy setting on the ac to turn the fan on. We also were constantly adjusting the ac, it seemed like it would get really hot and then really cold. We also tested out the hot tub, it was really nice, but we couldn't go out there at night because there was hardly any lights out there. I also wish the hot tubs were a little more private, the house's windows next to us looked right down into our hot tub and people using the walk way by our bungalow could see straight into where the hot tub was. I noticed most of the other houses with hot tubs were more \"private\" than ours so it may just be the way the houses are laid out.   They also brought us delicious breakfast every morning complimentary! It was so good and fresh! So much better than any complimentary breakfast at regular hotels!   Overall it was a great stay and we will definitely want to come back in the future!"

We remarked every day on how quiet the place is although there were many other guests staying there at the same time. The drive to the inn is remote but it will be worth your while. Each morning we were greeted with eggs, bacon or sausage and bakery (I requested gluten free and was accommodated easily). We had champagne and chocolates in our room upon arrival. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to spend a week just to relax and get out of town."

                "description": "Nice stay, but could be improved.  We stayed 2 nights at the Rocky Creek Retreat in the resort village area, full price and not from a Groupon deal.   The grounds were nice and well maintained with cute decor.  The hot tub was clean and the cover looked brand new.  As we left Monday, I heard them cleaning other hot tubs.  We enjoyed our 2 kitty visitors that hung out and 'talked' to us.  We saw deer, a tarantula, and a fox roaming the property in the evening.  Lots of butterflies and birds, and wasps.  Breakfast was served promptly at 9:30 each morning, and it was divine.  Sunday we had chocolate covered strawberries atop a small bowl of fruit, with champagne and glasses of orange juice, a boiled egg, a cinnamon roll which I believe was made from croissant dough, and bacon.  Monday we had cheddar scrambled eggs, sausage links,  a blueberry lemon pound cake slice, peach jam, biscuits, and orange juice.  I wish it were served earlier, but we were aware of that at the time of booking.  Be forewarned - the roads that lead throughout the bandb are very rough with significant bumps and deep gouges for small cars, so drive slowly.  Another note on the vehicular aspect - you are not able to park directly in front of this particular cottage.  There is an area for you to park, then walk to your cottage. When lugging heavy luggage and in warm weather, it is a bit of a chore.  When we arrived and I mentioned this, the lady who greeted us offered to use her golf cart to tote our bags for us to our cottage, which was very kind.  The bungalows are pretty close together.  We arrived about 10 minutes before check in time, and our bungalow was still in the process of being cleaned, which was expected to take 30-45 minutes.  She offered us complimentary drinks and coupons to various restaurants in town if we would have liked to start there versus waiting, but having all of our things in the vehicle, we chose to wait for it to be cleaned.  It took only 30 minutes, and she prepared a fruit and cheese plate for us since we had to wait.  The very first thing I noticed about the bungalow was that it was very clean, from top to bottom.  The bathroom towels were clean, soft and thick.  Another thing, which I didn't think to ask about, was whether or not they stopped in while we were out to refresh towel supplies.  They didn't, and we used 3 towels on the first night, leaving us with 1 bath towel.  No fault on the bandb's part.  I wasn't going to call late in the evening for 1 bath towel when we'd already brought 4 of our own beach towels.  We had 2 a/c units, one in the kitchen area and one in the bedroom.  They got cold and stayed cold quickly.  The floorplan and furniture set up were odd and not necessarily conducive to what you would use a particular room for.  The TV was was mounted to a wall, that would you could a) watch from one wicker chair or b) watch with your head sideways from the couch.  In the bedroom, there was in fact a queen size bed as stated.  Unfortunately, it was set up sideways in order to make it fit in the bedroom.  Instead of sleeping with our heads against a headboard, we slept with our heads against a wall.  There were not blinds on the back door leading out from the bedroom, just a gauzy curtain.  No shielding from the morning sun.  There was little storage for our things - we had expected a dresser at least.  There was one tiny closet, from which we were able to hang some of our clothes, but it was stuffed with about 5 huge pillows on the raised part where you might set a bag or something.  Ultimately, we dug clothes and things from our bags daily rather than being able to stow them in a dresser.  When we booked, we were told that the grotto like setting of the hot tub was private.  Our 'grotto' was easily viewable from the two neighboring cottages.  Private in my mind means not in plain view - it should be described as personal hot tub, not private.  There needs to be some wasp patrol - we had an active wasp's nest on our back patio, so enjoying the back patio was a no go.  One of the back deck chairs was missing a cushion, and some old fencing like material was just laid against the back deck.  One of the cabinets had a window drape just randomly thrown in.  The shower door was completely off its railings. It has been this way awhile, as the linoleum is starting to pull away from the shower wall due to the long term leaking water.  Also missing were smoke detectors.  There were outlets, but no smoke detectors. There were 5 missing vertical slats from the sliding doors, which 1 or so would be okay, but that was a bit much.  The kitchen window was cracked as well. The lack of storage, odd layout and the lack of maintenance on some things detracted from our stay.  Overall, our stay at Serenity Farmhouse Inn was okay, but we intend to try elsewhere for the amount of money that we paid.  I hope that their maintenance improves as it is obvious that they put a lot into getting the cottage built and decorated."

They informed us that the White Buffalo Bungalow was ready and we would be able to get settled in before leaving for the wine tour.   White Buffalo Bungalow was just breath taking from the private drive to the private jacuzzi.  The room has a full kitchen and had a bottle of welcome sangria to begin the pregaming before the wince tour.  The shower was amazing and the soaps, shampoo/conditioner smelled so good!   This was a Wednesday so we were lucky to be on the wine tour with only one other couple.  Jodi is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She got asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  Jodi is so knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing.   The pool area is so nice and calming.  Again it was the middle of the week and we had the pool to ourselves which was great.  Breakfast is brought to our room by about 9:45 each morning and was so good. (We were the last delivery.)  I was able to walk around the property 1  1/2 times and get a mile in each morning.   If you are not wanting to leave the property stop by HEB and pick up food to prepare in the room.  This was such a wonderful  experience I am already planning to go back next year."

                "description": "I am absolutely in love with the little Poets Cottage we stayed in last week. I really appreciate all of the attention to detail in the beautiful antique linens, fresh flowers, pillows, seating areas, bath tray etc. I could go on an on. It was a beautiful and relaxing retreat. It was in a wonderful central location for day trips to State Parks, great Texas BBQ, cute little towns and wonderful back roads. The view from the pool is spectacular. Nothing quite like a Hill Country sunset or sunrise either.   We really enjoyed the big Jacuzzi tub. It would have been nice to have a shower for quick mornings, but we made do. When the neighbors used theirs, their jets were so loud we could hear them. We could also hear the man's booming voice at times.   Their breakfast was amazing and presented in such a lovely way. I wish we could have gotten it a little earlier. I think 930 is probably perfect for a leisurely vacation where you sleep in, but we were up and hitting the roads early. We did wait around for it one day and I am so glad we did."

It really does not look like much from the outside but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and we were not disappointed! We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

                "description": "What a wonderful discovery on a lazy pre-Xmas Sat afternoon. Who would have thought you could find a boutique winery that rivals any that I've visited in Sonoma.   Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

                "description": "Wine: Only tried one wine, the tempranillo. It was fine, not as bold as they usually are. I smelled some of the whites, and they smelled very sweet so I passed. Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

We finally mustered the courage to go have a look inside this warehouse looking building.  What an incredible surprise!  We were warmly greeted and led into the tasting room where our eyes grew wide with wonder.  Themed tables, lounging areas, decor and a scuttle of people enjoying some of the most spectacular wine ever!    Everyone in there was so nice and the server we had was very knowledgeable.  My daughter promptly made sure everyone knew I was celebrating the 20th anniversary of my 30th birthday!  Our wine expert quickly informed the wine maker \"John\" and he came over to wish me a happy birthday and give me a taste of a special \"not on the menu\" wine.  All I can say is every single wine we sampled (8 in total) was superb!  I walked out after buying 4 bottles and was extremely happy!"

                "description": "Super friendly server and great location.  This is a fun winery that advertises a lot of events and offers \"wine cocktails\" which my wife really enjoyed.  It is keg wine so it comes out of spouts on the wall and they fill a bottle for you if you buy one.  This was different and I don't know enough about wine to know if it helps or not.   I really liked the laid back feel.  This doesn't have the pho-Tuscan Vegas facade that some of the bigger places have put up, but it is a fun lil hill country spot with a good sized deck, small indoor area and lots of shade to play corn hole or let kids run around.   The wine was good - we shared a tasting which is what we usually do before buying a glass - each was a good sized pour and I thought they were going to charge us for two but good sized pour is just how they roll.   Plan to return for sure!"

My wife and I have visited many of them since buying a house in the area over a year ago.  What I love about Vinovium are all the great events they put on.  From lounge takeovers, where winemakers give tastings of their wine, to stand-up comedy, to Trivia nights.   The owner and staff are all super welcoming and so knowledgeable about wine.  They've got a large selection of rotating wines on tap and you can get a bottle filled there to take home that can be brought back to reduce on waste, which is another plus in my book.   We'd only visited a couple times before we were sold on joining their membership club.  And since then we've enjoyed hanging out and feeling like we're part of the family.  Trivia night was such a blast.  And it's on the same night as their Prime rib dinner which was out of this world - check out my pictures.   For a change of pace from your ordinary winery/wine bar, I highly recommend a visit.  There's really no other place like this around here."

They were rude to my friends who paid for drinks and bottles of wine (separate from what was offered with the tour) and would not allow them to sit with us because we came as part of the tour and the table was for \"paying guests\". Additionally food was withheld from our group, but they explained it was because they could make $15 a plate off of other guests. It was just a bit tacky to explain it that way and made us uncomfortable.   On a more positive note, I thought a couple of wines were good, but given the competition in the area and the blatant price gouging, I would take my business elsewhere."

This place is amazing and we love it but like a good secret,kinda want to keep it to ourselves. Their wine selection is the best in town and their prices are amazing. Stephen, Tim and John all know and love their wines and are some of the nicest people we know. They offer weekly tastings that allow you to explore all sorts of different wines affordably.  If you love wine, this is your place."

You get inside and it's a really warm atmosphere, the bartender wine host was great friendly. There's a terrific selections of wine, there's a nice little bar, there's a private room on the side, I think it can be reserved possibly?  I have to tell you this was a secret spot that people should know about! The prices were reasonable, the wine selection was great the  atmosphere is five stars!  Give it a shot guys!"

I had my service dog with me, however, there was only one table outside to sit at but there was another dog who tried to attack my dog nearby. So when we asked to sit inside, they refused to let us in with my service dog.  After a heated exchange, I was told \"F\" You\" belittled and verbally attacked by several customers and the owner.  I was very appalled and would never recommend this place that was so condescending and refused our service.  I have the right to take my service dog wherever I go.  This is the most shocking appalling and disrespectful situation I've ever experienced at a public place!! Negative stars!!"

This is the type of place that a group could enjoy, a wine beginner wouldn't find intimidating, and a wine snob could also find something to please their pallet. Good selection of all types, but not intimidating.  THE STAFF ARE ALL SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! I was given a few suggestions from the owner, and they were all so spot on, I loved every one I tried.   Love the clean but welcoming decor, and how everything feels approachable and interactive (Glasses for sale, books, etc) and there's even some outdoor seating for those feeling a fire pit (if memory serves correctly, but the night I was here, the rain kept everyone inside).   Bring some girls, a group, or just stop by on your way home for a friendly wine bar with the coziness that makes you want to curl up and order an entire bottle and chat with folks."

Don't know if anyone else has had this issue in finding great wines, particularly Cabernet, in Texas, but we have! We came in and were welcomed with open arms and amazing conversation! In depth information of wines and tasting until we found the right glass to order.  After 15 months of living here we have finally found our \"home\" in regards to wine and friends! We will definitely  be back and can't wait to experience all they have to offer! Down to earth people and an experience you won't regret.  P.S. the decor is amazing!"

It is obvious that this area needs something like this.  As a woman owned business, I am happy to see it thrive.  Deep into Steiner Ranch, I am not sure people who live outside of the area would be seeking it out but worth the trip if you are into wine and want to check out the space.  Could be a good place for a celebration.  Steiner probably has enough people to support.  Rose, white, red, bubbles and brews.  Cheese plates.  You can buy bottles to take with you with various mustards, jams, etc in their pantry. Glad I got to experience this location and wish them all the luck moving forward."

I appreciate that the wine list is ever changing and that the employees all do an amazing job with recommendations and descriptions. There is also a pretty large price range so you're able to choose a glass based on how much you'd like to spend, which is great for their range of customers. Now about the decor/atmosphere: I'd like to have my home designed to look similar to S+P. It's fun and new and modern but elegant and sophisticated at the same time. I wouldn't change a thing!   My favorite time to go is on a chilly evening. I love to be curled up by the fire on the patio with blankets (provided by S+P) and a big glass of cab with live music playing in the background. Come on! That's heaven!   Do yourself a favor and follow them on Facebook. They host great events, my favorite being Sip In SWEATS. You will not be disappointed!"

The sangria, Petit Verdot and Cabernet were good.  I didn't try too many it their sweet wines although there were quite a few. The ambiance is laid back and there is some artwork to take in as well as a small charcuterie plate and maybe something else, I'm not quite sure. Definitely swing by and check these guys out on your trek along 290. Plus it's close to 281 so it's an easy first. Happy tasting!!"

The lady, who we probably annoyed in the beginning, really helped us understand the process and gave us tips on wine tasting.  She was very accommodating and personable.  We tasted the entirety of the tasting menu.  We were also glad the place was not as busy.  There were 9 of us and enjoyed the place.  We were a little disappointed because we waited for the scheduled musician to come but cancelled last minute.  However, the rating is for the wine and the experience and the lady who gave us her time and patience. All deserve an A+."

The venue has great outdoor space. A lot of open area with seating. Also a great covered area for music acts and dancing. One thing I noticed right away while sitting outside was NO BUGS. The whole time we did not get bit by a single mosquito. The lawn is treated well. They also have a nice layout indoors. Great bar area for wine pouring and a large room that can be a private space.   Wine selections ranged from sweet to dry. I really enjoyed the Pink Sky Rose, it's sweet and easily my favorite. I mostly kept with that selection for the birthday party.   I will be coming back to experience as a customer and partake in the tasting and music acts. It's also important for me to celebrate and support Black woman owned businesses."

The owner is super sweet. She took the time to come to our table and greet us. Make sure to ask us how everything was going and how we liked things.  She took the time to recommend some wines and go over the different textures and flavors.  I'm not a wine person myself but my friend and her mom are. I definitely learned a lot from them.  We purchased a charcuterie board, it came with cheese , nuts and a super delicious olive jalapeños thing! MY GOD that was delicious.  Did I mention it is a veteran owned , black owned , women business ?! Whooooooo as if It couldn't get better.  But to makeIt better , it is SO peaceful out there Definitely recommend to check out."

On the Sunday evening we were there, a gentleman was playing some very smooth jazz and adding to the relaxed atmosphere.  The owner came and offered us free samples of some Moscato that had just been finished. It was delicious.  Last but not least, since the owner is a veteran, she offers a military discount on the food."

For the tasting, you can choose four wines for $15 or six wines for $20. They are doing all tastings outside so that social distancing can be maintained and they brought all six wines out as a flight. Service was attentive and friendly and all servers were wearing masks. The wines were on the sweet side for my taste (I prefer dry, bold reds). They had a small selection of small plates (charcuterie, dips with vegetables, and pizza). My only reason for giving four stars was the pizza was a cheap frozen pizza that they heated up. We enjoyed the experience and supporting a new winery that opened up during a pandemic."

Service was good. Set up makes it easy to socially distance from others. Easy to order snacks from menu.  The one thing that was the deal breaker for me is that their tasting menu offered 7 wines yet all were VERY dry. There was one sweet one listed but sold out. I scheduled a group tasting for 13. Most of the people in my group made it through 4-6 tastings w/o finishing and absolutely no one made a wine purchase and that says a lot."

We were seated on the patio which was comfortable.  There isn't a vineyard onsite which detracted from the experience.  The Chardonnay was very good.  Smooth with just the right balance of dry to sweet.  We wanted to love this place as it is veteran owned and the owner was quite friendly.  The waitress was socially awkward at best.  She wasn't able to answer questions about the wine or small plates.  When we asked for more crackers for the artichoke dip and hummus we were told they're pre-packaged so we couldn't have more.  I was certainly willing to pay but that was not an option.  I hope this was a unique experience and they will be successful."

We were a bit skeptical because of its limited reviews on yelp but I'm so glad we went and tried it out. Their wine is great, their flights are customized to your individual pallet, and their charcuterie board is to die for. If you go during the summer be sure to try their peach/apricot wine. I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but it was a great refreshing summer drink! They are located in a small development that also has a few shops, a bakery, and Nate's coffee and cocktails right next to it... and we can't forget, this place is only two blocks from Louies barbecue"

I can't speak to the wine, as I'm not really a wine drinker, but the others had multiple glasses and brought bottles home with them. Judith tried to find a wine for me and I ended up with a nice WHITE sangria. How great to find a white one as red unfortunately gives me headaches. We all sat around, drank, talked, ate and just had a great time. Those lemon almonds just melted in my mouth. Never had those before and want more. Judith had two nice nut, cheese and meat plates for us to nibble. So warm and welcoming like you were in the home of a friend. Look forward to stopping in once again."

                "description": "Blanco has many local, historic, and natural charms to this little town in the Hill Country.  Now, it has something people will talk about more when they go to Blanco...a charming winery! Opened since this past April, owner Judith Raven is no stranger to the Texas grape and wine world. For almost 20 years, she has been experimenting with grape growing in the Hill Country near Spring Branch.  The estate has about 6 acres of grape vines planted and is known for Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, and Merlot. The logo on the bottles, a raven, is a nod to the owner's last name. When we visited, there were six wines featured on their tasting menu. The 2018 Sauvignon Blanc is sourced from Sierra Foothills AVA until the Texas Sauvignon Blanc grapes are ready. It is quite crisp with some distinct peach notes. The 2017 Hill Country Tannat is quite smooth with ripe strawberry and jam flavors. The 2017 Texas High Plains Tempranillo features more spice with a smooth finish. You'll be delighted and quite happy with the 2014 Petite Syrah/Sangiovese blend.  Sourced from Reddy Vineyards, it is still drinking quite well. It is bold with nice tannic structure and is well balanced.  The last Esperanza wine is a sweet Orange Muscat. Source from the Texas High Plains, it hits the spot when temperatures heat up during the last three months of the year!  There is also a wine from Fly Gap that you can try called Cowboy Way.  It is for those who enjoy something bold and strong in a red.  We enjoyed visiting with Judith's daughter and hearing how they came up with the name for the winery. The name Esperanza comes from Judith's childhood and relates to many good things that came with that name on her life's journey, starting with living on a street named such. Now, Blanco has more good things going for it with the addition of this winery in the area. Inside the tasting room one will find tables and assorted cozy areas to sit and sip and relax as they enjoy their visit. There are also tables and chairs outside to enjoy the lovely warm fall temperatures of late.  There is new artwork on the walls for sale by local artists making the space even more inviting and interesting. All in all, the space makes you feel right at home. Stop by and check it out for yourself. You just might find some new wines you enjoy and make sure to keep checking in from time to time, because there are more wines planned to be released.  Cheers!"

                "description": "My wife and I went to Bella Vista Ranch for a 4th of July tour with lunch, and we found it to be terrific value for the money. There was a nice lunch from a food truck (the name of which eludes me, unfortunately) followed by an interesting talk about the history of olive oil and the origins of the Italian family farm dating back to the second century BCE. The owner explained how he established Bella Vista on the ancient Roman model and described the modifications he has made to make olives grow in Texas. Then we toured the olive orchard and learned about the different varieties of grapes grown on the property. We saw the processing room containing the \"frantoio\" or olive press as well as the vats where this year's wines are aging. We then tasted several oils as well as four glasses of wine per person. All this for $25 (the regular tour without lunch is only $15).  Oils, vinegars, wines and soaps are available for sale. These are pretty expensive (e.g. $18+ for 250ml of their basic Texas Blend oil), but I don't mind paying those prices for high-quality locally produced specialty goods. This is a fascinating day out, which I recommend wholeheartedly.  Pro tip: If you're coming from San Antonio, take I-35 instead of US 281 and the back roads. We were expecting a relaxing drive in the country, but construction and traffic made it a stressful trip. Coming back on 35 was a joy by comparison!"

                "description": "So, so rude. The olive oil and vinegar are excellent, but the experience was ruined by the lady--the one everyone complains of here. The hours on Sunday are until 4. I get there at 3:25, and she walks past me with her whiny, demanding voice telling me that they close at 3:30. Uh, wanna put that on your website as your updated hours?  I went in anyway. The gentleman doing the oil tasting was knowledgeable and helpful. He told the lady to close the gate.  You know, what a non-stupid person would do should they slothfully decide to close early since they dont work for a living.  My mother was incredibly upset by this lady's rudeness. When you run a service like this, you stay open until you no longer have a good flow of customers. Closing is at 4? Hi, if a bunch of people are coming in at 3:30 thru 4:00, you keep working. Lazy Texas people who inherited their property and think they work hard by paying others to harvest their crop and bottle it. Meritocracy, right? They are the class of people who make this state an impoverished mess.    Don't run a customer service business dependent upon people stopping by on a lark like a fascist regime. You don't get to do that. Then again, when you dont have a legitimate concern about how you pay your bills, i guess you can just work until you get bored with the whole work thing.   Go sell wholesale if you hate customers. Working for yourself does not mean you get any more freedom. You have are dependent on good will. And you don't have mine.  The lady tried to make up for her garbage attitude when i made my purchase. You know what? Have a blessed day, lady. A.BLESSED.DAY.  Tl;dr. There are other puveyors of Texas olive oil, particularly in south Texas. Do not waste your wine tasting trip here. If you want to support local, consider others who are hard-working enough to sell their products in Central Market."

The tour and history of olives was really interesting. Definitely try the balsamic and infused oils. The wine tasting was pretty brief compared to the olive portion but great none the less. The wines are dryer, not sweet. I thought they were great. A lot of the other local wineries wines are very sweet, but I really enjoyed these! You should absolutely plan to visit if in the area."

While the wine is fine, the server was the single most rude person I've ever encountered at a winery. Just astounding how she could be that rude for the duration of the wine tasting. I will never go back and suggest no one ever go there. You cant drink the wine fast enough to over come they workers rudeness."

                "description": "We liked the olive oil a lot.  However... I think the \"thorn\" of this place is the owner.  He seems rather joyless in making something that could ideally fulfill the soul.  His 1 1/2 hour (yes, it's long) \"tour\" is mostly comprised of the history of the Olive, snarky political opinions, braggary of his past career in Silicone Valley, and a hatred for Texas AandM.   Not a place to take a kid. Seriously.  We sat and listened to him for well over an hour then briefly stood under two olive trees, looked at another one that was hurt in a storm, looked at the press machinery, and then did a \"tasting.\" Like I said, the oil was good. I got the impression that the lady helping in the gift shop/tasting room didn't want to be there either. Basically I was confused why this man (and his 5th wife...no lie) were running this business and opening it to the public.  I walked away a little sad that something so wonderful like successfully growing beautiful trees to make a solid product could be reduced to something so joyless."

                "description": "We were warned at great length that we could not even look at our cell phones during the tour which seemed odd when people might have a kid or babysitter or be waiting on something important from work to come through--I mean we are all adults...but I soon found out why.  Far less than an entertaining traditional tour, you sit and listen to someone talk more like a college class lecture, but with way too many rabbit trails of information that eventually make you tune out.  Like what a certain blizzard is called in different parts of the world, how accounting dates back to the Romans, etc.  I am passionate about olive oils and wine but learned too much about history and every other subject to even focus on what I wanted to know about olive oil. Or feel entertained.  The group I was with concurred.   There are 3 types of learners: auditory, visual, and tactile and the class is entirely sit and listen to one man talk for half of it then stand and listen by a tree then a press for the other half. So only appealing to auditory learners. And no audience engagement during the lecture.  At the end you actually get to see and touch. But they had no bread for us so we had to drink an olive oil and talk about it for 30 more minutes so I left before I tasted the other flavored oils as it had already been a full day of just listening to way too much info to retain.  In a very strict manner rather than entertaining with audience engagement.  And strict rules.  Obviously people tune out and begin looking at their cell phones so that's why they don't allow them.  Rather than making the tour entertaining so you dont' want to--It was in the hot sun as well so it was pretty miserable.  The olive oil was good but I've had better, it was a bit weak to me, we did the wine tasting as well and those were not acceptable to me.  I actually would recommend skipping the tour and talking to the staff as you taste the olive oil because they knew all of the information given on the tour without the lengthy side notes of things that should be shaved off for entertainment value.  And that's really the best part.    I don't think they like people very much though to be honest."

                "description": "A hidden mecca of olives.  In central Texas.  The Bella Vista Ranch was designed as a traditional Italian family farm and features the first commercially grown olives in Texas.  And the olives I sampled are Texas size and Texas good.  Apparently the crowd favorite is the bleu cheese stuffed olive.  We sampled a garlic stuffed olive that was really good.  The ranch also offers delicious balsamic vinegars and olive oils which go for around $17 a bottle.  My lips slurped the Fig Vanilla Balsamic over and over again.  I am sure I was sample cheating but that stuff is incredible.     This is also a working winery that produces several red and white varieties plus a Natural Blackberry Wine!  Yum.  Wine tastings are $5/per person.  I think the owner has a great thing going for him and a beauty of a property. Tours of the orchard happen on the weekend and include a wine tasting for $10/per person."

I have been back four times now and each time come away with a little more understanding of the narrative that is offered. While I purchased my typical bottles of olive oil - some for myself, some for holiday gifts - I did also indulge in some olive oil based soaps.   The olives and oil are fabulous. I am not as great a fan of their wines. They are not awful, just not with the properties I care for, typically. The in-laws found a favorite to take home, though.  The tour is still $10 and includes the wine tasting, which is a good deal.  Bottles of oil range from $16-$27 each, depending on size.  Soap is $6.99 a bar.  They also feature balsamic vinegars (not made there) and jars of olives, which are delightful as well."

                "description": "Do not judge a book by its cover. Take one look at Jack and the humble grounds here at Bella Vista, and you'd never guess that he has olive friends he emails with back in Italy or that he can tell you all you'd ever want to know about the science and technique behind growing and processing olives.  I would highly recommend the tour - while there isn't much walking involved in this tour, my husband and I found it to be highly informative. And with Jack's red-blooded Texan sense of humor, it was a very entertaining education. Be sure to note the times of the tour (Sat @ 10am and 1pm, and Sun @ noon) since it's a group setup.   After the tour comes a tasting of several types of olive oil produced on site along with some of their balsamic vinegar offerings. While they also have wine offered, I'd recommend sticking with the olive oil - clearly what they specialize in. If you're only interested in tasting the oils/wines (not the tour), it's probably good to avoid arriving at the tasting room about an hour after each tour start since the tasting room isn't overly large and tends to fill up easily with the folks coming off the tour."

Their products are not made by them in Wimberley and when asked about that they became extremely defensive.  Beautiful place that has a lot of potential if they were friendly and cared about the experience people want from that kind of place... but the vibe is anything but friendly and welcoming.

                "description": "While I thought it was pretty interesting to learn about and taste boutique olive oil (as I'd never been to an olive ranch before) $15 per person does seem a little high when the actual tour is quite short and obviously the intention is that you're going to buy some stuff at the end, and all that stuff is small batch and quite pricey (understandably so.)  So it ends up  being more like $100 for two people when you include the olive oil you will want to buy plus the wine you might want to buy (some people seem to think it sucks, we liked some of it.)  But you will leave with a buzz on and some delicious olive oils!  The owners were away so their daughter gave the tour; I thought she was pretty funny and personable but there were some questions she couldn't answer but it was really no big deal (and she wasn't super long winded like the owner seems to be  but of course some people like that and some people don't.) It's also probably better when there are olives on the trees but it was still overall pretty interesting to see the different trees different olives grow up and hear some history and facts about olive oil production.  I liked hearing about the process and seeing the machinery. And of course I liked tasting the fresh olive oil, which was indeed super tasty and surprisingly spicy. Most of their oils are made from all different olives smushed together but they have one variety that's just made with one kind of olive which we got to try. They also had a blood orange infused oil that I'm now obsessed with; we bought some and later made some asparagus on the grill that had been rubbed with the oil, it was the most delicious asparagus ever! We also enjoyed the wine; we are not wine snobs in any way but we enjoyed what we had and bought a bottle just  because it's the polite thing to do. We sat out on the bench in front of the tasting room and enjoyed our wines and just had a lovely afternoon.   I will say that it gets a little hectic in the tasting room when people come in just for a tasting after a tour- I would say if you want just a tasting, don't come between 1:30-2:30 because it's going to get confusing!"

She was delighted to hear that we moved out here from San Francisco (that's where she grew up but couldn't  stand the fog). The husband is an old curmudgeon, but delightfully so. He worked in high-tech in Silicon Valley and moved out his last company to Austin in the early 90s, eventually leaving to grow olives and make wine.   it's not always the case that you visit a winery and the owners pour for you, so that was a treat. They are a very small production and a bit off the beaten path, so it was pretty quiet there too. A small group arrived just as we were leaving, but it was nothing like the bustling tasting rooms at nearby Driftwood Cellars.  The blackberry wine is actually good--you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's made of blackberry not grapes. And the other three reds we tasted were also nice."

It has always been amazing, and they have expanded it considerably since the fire. The outdoor decks are sprawling, so many places to take in that view. And y'all, it had the absolute most stunning view of Lake Travis.   I just lost my father and was in need of an escape and some fresh air. Today I brought my dad's convertible mustang out (I MAY have gone kinda fast) to have lunch on this perfect blue bird day. I definitely felt his presence out here with me.   My server was so friendly and had the best customer service. I really enjoyed her serving me. I ordered a swirl margarita and chips and queso which were delivered quickly. For lunch I had a mixed fajita with steak and shrimp, refried beans and the fixings. Food was delicious.   I love the art they have installed around the restaurant. Really gorgeous bronze sculptures and we'll appointed gardens.   Thank you for a perfect experience."

                "description": "The Oasis is great for outdoor dining and has an amazing view of Lake Travis, especially during a sunset.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited Austin for a quick weekend getaway.  A small group of us came out for lunch and we didn't have to wait long because it was an early lunch and the weather was a bit cold.    PROS:  Even though the water level was a bit low, the view of Lake Travis was AMAZING!  Make sure to sit outside to be able to enjoy the view.  During the summer, it's worth it to make reservations during the sunset to get the most out of your experience.  The wait staff are super friendly and are attentive to all your needs.  CONS:  I will echo some of the other reviews on here and say the food is mediocre Tex-Mex at best.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos and beef fajitas.  The tacos are decently seasoned, but the rice and beans are a bit bland and the dish overall was a bit cold.  The fajitas did come out nice and hot and the meat was seasoned well.  I will definitely be ordering the fajitas for the next time.  The drinks and desserts we ordered:  an Irish coffee, the Fantasy Chocolate Cake (which is a flourless chocolate) and the flan.  The Chocolate cake was surprisingly delicious while the flan was a bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor is really good.  The area surrounding the restaurant also has eclectic artwork to look at as well as small retail shops to explore.  Due to Covid each store has limited hours so you may want to call ahead to see if they're open.  Overall, it's a great area to sight see in Austin.  Especially if it's your first time."

I wanted to experience the nature side of Austin.   The Oasis on Lake Travis was the place for us to venture out too. My brother said he had not been to it before, but wanted to try it.   To my surprise it was something grand. Absolutely gorgeous views of the lake and the more upscale houses Austin has to offer.   My brother and my parents had had a bite to eat prior to coming here, but I had not. I went shopping a the Domain and they had gone eating. From what I have heard, The Oasis is good for drinking, but not so good for eating. Their food is honestly sub par at best.   We ordered some drinks and chips and guac for the table. But I wanted something a little more in my stomach. I got the grilled shrimp tacos. They were good. But I have definitely had better. The only thing was that they were super spicy. I was not expecting them to be that spicy. All of a sudden my tongue was sweating and I was uncomfortable with that.   This is a must stop for the views. The views are outstanding. But the food was not the best. The mojito I had was strong. It was like one sip and I was already feeling it."

                "description": "The Oasis on Lake Travis is one of those tricky places where you have to average out the good with the bad to get a good idea of the place.  The good:  No question about it, the sunset is second to none, awesome views, awesome picturesque scene, and just about all of the outdoor seating has a great view of the scene. An additional positive, is the parking.  Easy to get to, plenty of free parking for the complex they are in, and even has valet parking if you prefer not to walk the 100 yards to the restaurant.  The not so good: I don't want to say the food was necessarily bad, it was just mediocre Mexican cuisine with a relatively small selection compared to your normal Mexican place.  To go along with the mediocre food is a price of about 1.5-2x what you would typically pay, but again you are here for the view not the food. The service also was not bad, but I think \"nonchalant\" would be the best way to describe it.  So the real question, would I recommend it? Yes I would but just go into it with the right mindset that you are going for the view, you are paying for the view and you will not be disappointed!  I would probably not go back if I am in Austin, but I am glad we went once."

My shrimp tacos were well flavored and a good (yet not overflowing) portion. Menu wise they could definitely work on their beer selection - need more craft beers and some varied selection of beer styles."

                "description": "My friends and I wanted a nice dinner on one of our last nights in Austin. We got to Oasis on a Sunday night about 45 min before sunset and were told the wait would be about 30 min for outdoor seating. We ended up getting seated in like 15 min. The views here are truly unmatched and pictures don't do it justice.  We went to Oasis with the mindset that we were mostly going for the views and not really the food, given the reviews. However, we were actually pleasantly surprised that the food wasn't that bad - overpriced, yes, but not terrible if you get things other than the tacos.  We got quesadillas and burgers. The quesadilla was very tasty and came with some guac, salad, and even queso! My one friend got the burger which was good but a little overcooked. The fries it came with were perfectly crispy and seasoned.  Service was good - our server was running late initially, but sent someone over to give us some waters. Afterwards, they were attentive checking in on us.  Overall exceeded our expectations, especially on a busy weekend. Would definitely come again!"

                "description": "The views you get from this restaurant are incredible! I highly recommend sitting outside.  I've been here a couple of times, but for some reason today was extra tasty! I just ordered a cheese quesadilla, with all the toppings on the side, and some chips and queso. Both were delicious! Honestly, they were the best cheese quesadillas I've ever had, and this is coming from an extremely picky eater who lives off of things like cheese quesadillas and cheese pizza; I've tried a lot of different cheese quesadillas and these were THE best. Tons of cheese, and the blend of whatever cheeses they used work so well together. The queso was creamy and rich. I couldn't get enough of either!!  The service was super quick and I didn't have any issues with rude behavior, like I see a lot of in the reviews. I guess it just depends what day you go? I came on a Sunday at about 3pm, and there were plenty of tables along with fast and friendly service.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I do agree with other Yelpers on the pricing being a little high. But only for certain items. (Check the menu out online beforehand if you're curious)  I definitely recommend you try this place at least once and judge for yourself on whether it's worth while or not; it definitely is to me!"

                "description": "The views of Lake Travis from The Oasis make the trip here worthwhile. Definitely seems like a touristy spot serving very average Tex-Mex. Our server was excellent despite the kitchen messing up our order and how hectic/busy it was even for a Thursday night. Food came out before the drinks, and the children's' food came out much later than the adults' food. The shrimp tacos were surprising good (4/5). The fajitas weren't bad (3/5) but due to the current onion recall, it was missing onions and just didn't feel the same. I had the frozen mango margarita which was strong and not too sweet.   Food: 3.5/5 Service: 5/5 Views: 5/5"

                "description": "At Oasis on Lake Travis the view is absolutely breathtaking and super relaxing to enjoy the Sun and view. First time here and this place is jam packed with people before dinner rush. I came here around 4:30pm and all of the outside tables were full. The wait was about 45 minutes. I went to get a strawberry margarita at the bar and walked down to the below deck to enjoy the view. It was so relaxing!!! (The strawberry margarita mixture was extremely sweet and over priced. Personally I wouldn't order that again.)   Skip forward to being seated to our outside table.... Everyone was packed in the area with tables and seats like sardines in a can. I had to be careful not to hit the person sitting behind me when fulling my chair out. It was not a comfortable setting at all. I ordered a cheese burger with fries and queso with chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty tasty and the chips were super crispy! The queso needed to be more cheesy. It's melty but oddly isn't cheesy enough. Very strange. The burger was a one star. Not well seasoned and lacking of everything. It was very very very sad. The fries were crispy but came out cold. Service was really great! Our waiter was top notched and provided excellent service. He was attentive and checked on us often. Five stars for service but the food was subpar for such a beautiful view. If you are a foodie and came here for the food.... You will be disappointed. If you don't care to eat and just want to get a over priced snack and drinks to enjoy the view ... this maybe your place."

The food isn't the worst but it's not the best. I'm sure time of day matters. We went earlier in the day so I'm sure that's the best the experience gets. The server was nice and attentive. The fries came cold which was surprising as they just opened less than an hour ago. However, the ambience is good and I know the pandemic tanked many businesses who are struggling to provide staffing which impedes service. When we visit restaurants we have to remember we are still in a pandemic and businesses are recovering."

The menu is small and pretty basic, similar to Tex-mex diner food. We had guacamole and queso for appetizers and shrimp tacos, classic burger and steak fajita for entrees. We also had drinks Tropical Depression and Margarita. I was not impressed by the menu, the taste of the food (lacked flavor) or the drinks (lacked liquor). The service was good and the view. I'd recommend only for the experience but I would not go back."

The food dint look appealing and the drinks seemed over priced. The outdoor is really good overlooking Lake Travis. Awesome view but the food and drinks are not that great. Service is okay. It took them a while to realize we were seated and waited to be attended to. I would recommend skipping this place, bring your own food and enjoy the free views from the adjacent building!"

Located right off the Square so easy walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the creek. I recommend Kiss the Cook (souvenirs, kitchen gadgets, coffee, etc) and Wimberley Cafe (good burgers and pie). The courtyard is beautifully decorated and relaxing. Plenty of FREE breakfast and pre-packaged snacks available even during COVID (cereal, Nutri-grain and Nature Valley bars, Chewy bars, muffins, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, pudding packs, fruit cups, yogurt, chips, milk and water for $1).  Stayed in the Maeson room. You have to exit the home into the courtyard to access this room, but I liked the privacy. Very comfortable king size bed, fresh linens, very spacious room w/ mini fridge, microwave, and tv, not much counter space in the bathroom though. Hosts were incredibly nice and welcoming. I would return!"

                "description": "My sister got married last week in Wimberly, TX. Our family thought, \"this is so random\". Neither of the families lived there and most of us had never heard of Wimberly. Then my sister said she had booked us at The Square Inn and gave us room arrangements.   I had flown in leaving MD at 4 am then getting to Dallas and then drove an hour. It felt like it was 5 in the afternoon but in reality it was 11am.   We walk into the Square Inn and was greeted by the owners. It never even hit my mind from the crazy traveling, check in was at 3 PM. To be honest I didnt think about it till others said there hotels would not let them early check in.   When meeting the owners, it felt like family. It almost felt like we were all coming home. They were so great. They let us in early and was cool enough to say, \"we need to run out before the others come, you are in charge.\"   The whole place was beautiful and amazing. Every room was perfect for single friends, to my other sisters and my crazy, but loveable nephews. Mr. Loyd one of the owners was like a natural grandfather with letting the boys run around but also telling them to close the door to keep AC inside. Lol  My favorite spot was the court yard. It looks like something out of a movie. Plus when it rains you can sit and watch the rain hit the roof. It's so peaceful.   So on top of a friendly, welcoming, beautiful space to stay and socialize, they also cook breakfast. Let me tell you it was the best food I have ever had at a bed and breakfast place.   We could smell the bacon at 6 am. Yum yum   So hands down this is place to stay in Wimberly. Its walking distance of all the cool shops and places to eat in town."

                "description": "Cons: * There were mosquitoes CONSTANTLY flying around our room. We never left the door open, so I don't know how they kept coming in. (This was the biggest con) * When we placed the \"service our room\" card on our door, no one ever came to fix the bed or resupply fresh towels. We were gone for like the whole day, and no one came, so that wasn't nice * The water pressure in the shower was too hard * The bathroom floor would get soaking wet anytime we took a shower because the curtain wouldn't stay closed all the way to prevent the water from going outside the tub. * When they gave us the wifi password they spelled it with a capital T, but really it was all lowercase, so we had a hard time getting the WiFi to work until we called the front desk.   Pros: * it is within walking distance to all the little stores and Wimberley cafe. * the staff is friendly. * The price of the room is reasonable   They just need to fix all the cons listed, and I think they would have a fine place to stay. Very unique and quirky. Also, I do think it would be nice if they had cable television."

We were lucky to have made reservations at the Square Inn.  This place is quaint and hip at the same time.  Our room/suite was large and clean and really comfy.  The staff and owners were great and accommodating. We had to leave early due to the weather so we really couldn't enjoy all of the amenities, but we r definitely going to return. The Square Inn is a great choice for being close to the Square. Lots of great places to walk to and enjoy. Can't wait to go back and we will absolutely b staying at the Square Inn.

I'm pregnant and can only have Tylenol which the claimed they had in their \"large variety\" which only consisted of off brand aspirin. when i emailed them asking for documents all they did was argue with me (a customer) instead of trying to resolve the problem.

                "description": "My mother and I spent one night at the Square Inn. They were extremely accommodating even though we could only spend one night when they normally have a two night minimum. The room was very spacious,  decorated perfectly and very clean. The inn was fully booked but you wouldn't even know it because it was so nice and quiet. We felt as though we had the whole place to ourselves. The owners are so very nice and informative. The inn is walking distance to many shops and dining options. We weren't able to stay for breakfast but it smelled delicious. We will definitely be going back!!"

It was very quiet at night and our beds were very comfortable.  Also, you can't beat the location for walking to the shops and restaurants."

                "description": "Myself and my fiancee recently visited Square Inn, and were very pleased with our stay.  The Lauren Room was clean, with warm, rustic interiors and a fabulously comfortable king-size bed.  The patio located just a few steps from our door was spacious; nice place to hang out before venturing to either Marco's Italian or Cypress Creek for dinner (both restaurants, by the way..  wonderful).  Square Inn is walking distance from some truly amazing dining, along with quaint knick knack shops (soaps, candy, etc.)-- not to mention you're swimming the Blanco, or tasting at Wimberley Valley Winery, in just a few minutes' drive.  Can't beat that.  Which reminds me: amenities included a big-screen t.v. in the common area, a decent library of DVD'S, an Xbox 360 game console with games, and complimentary wine in the afternoon and evenings.  Really, really nice being able to wind down for the night with a movie, and a glass or two from Duchman Winery.   Marci, our innkeeper at Square Inn, was very friendly, and courteous, even during a fluke front-door locking mechanism malfunction which resulted in our having to wake her up."

                "description": "This is a quiet little place with 6 rooms.  The innkeeper, Marci, serves breakfast every morning in the common area.  According to her, this place is a labor of love, and it shows.  The beds are comfortable and the atmosphere is peaceful.  I will definitely be staying again next spring.  If you are visiting Wimberly for the Square, the inn is literally a stone's throw away."
